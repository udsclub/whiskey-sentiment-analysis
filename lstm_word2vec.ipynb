       "2273   I saw the movie and really could not stop my tears. Its tragedy that India has no such leaders after freedom, who dare to do justice with their own children, when they don't behave properly.. In current generation, politicians bring their children's into politics without measuring their caliber and skills.. I remember the dialogue from Gandhi 'What kind of society we want to create/make with such people (about Harilal)?' No wonder that it will be a dream that India will hardly have such leader in this or next generation.. Einstein was right when he said about Gandhi that 'After 50 years one would hardly believe that such person with body, soul and mind (Mahatma Gandhi) had ever lived on this earth.' I sincerely want to THANKS a LOT to Anil kapoor, Feroze khan and all film actors/actresses for this wonderful movie about great person and relationship with his son. All father and son should watch this movie once and take some lessons for both roles.   \n",

But instead it focuses on a little normal village that is obviously surrounded by the 'green pastures' of the Emerald-Isle that are often shown in Irish films.

       "      <td>Great Balls of Fire is the movie you show to someone you really, really hate. It is absolute torture of the highest rank and is probably used by minions of a foreign power to extract info from captured intelligence agents. I've enjoyed some of Dennis Quaid's performances in the past, but he goes totally over the top in this film. He doesn't so much cross the line, he pole vaults over it, then comes back to jump over and over again. He struts and mugs as if on some incredibly bad acid trip. It's one of those rare performances where you wish you could enter the film and beat the man within an inch of his life for doing something so truly awful. Was he desperate to win a Golden Raspberry or some other award for bad acting? That's the only conclusion I can come up with. Thank you Dennis, you gave us a bad performance for the ages. Where was the director to reign in this guy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opposite end of the extreme is Winona Ryder, she of the plastic features and plastic acting. I came across a review of her acting style that compared her to a wax dummy. That was of course an insult to wax dummies all over the earth, all of whom could have brough more humanity to the role of Jerry's underage cousin/wife. This brings up the film's mixed up message, that being it is 100% okay to marry your own cousin and have a child by the union. I fail to see what is so \"okay\" about that, but it looks as though Hollywood thinks that underage incest is hunky dory. Talk about \"family values.\"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another problem is the format. Is it a stright forward re telling of Lewis' life, or is it a musical? I'm not talking about the music, I'm talking about the truly weird scene where Jerry drives up to the school, starts to belt out a tune and everyone starts to dance like it was Broadway musical in search of a Tony. Fantasy and reality are thrown together in a mix that does not work. But who really cares? I don't. And neither should you. You can't get back the minutes of life you would waste on this film. So don't waste your time, it's too precious for something this misguided and poor.</td>\n",

There is less than nothing original about it and I truly would have given it zero or less stars were it possible on IMDb. The only part of my viewing that I enjoyed was when a group of teenagers sitting in front of us decided to play a game of 'ghosts'. It was a lot more exciting than whatever was going on on the screen in front of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot was basically some guy going on a rampage. And the thing was, it wasn't even a slightly exciting rampage. Maybe if the guy had been remotely frightening rather than a tame Robbie Williams lookalike with a baseball cap, I might have sat there feeling slightly anxious. The fact that I cared less about the characters than I did about the colour of the cinema carpet didn't really add to the effect, either. And to make matters worse, the rest of the characters were equally one-dimensional and oblivious. The hotel staff didn't seem to notice or care that one of their maids had vanished and are further proof that a murderer is unrecognisable after he has had a shave. I was incredibly surprised that the bitchy, stereotypical girl in the blue dress was the only person to notice who he was. She realises this and then proceeds to fall down the stairs, entangle herself in a plastic sheet and then knock over a pile of paint buckets. Nice one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst thing was, I hold the belief that that the director was trying his absolute hardest. He really pushed all boundaries by not showing any killing actually happening. Shocking! And the music, don't even get me started. It was almost as appropriate as stripping at a funeral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish that Prom Night was a joke. It was terrible and stupidly predictable. No one, in their right mind or otherwise, has any reason to see this film. Mainstream cinema seems to be going downhill and films like this worsen the situation.

       "      <td>Apart from having the longest reign in British history (63 years), Queen Victoria also holds two other distinctions. She was, apart from our current Queen, the oldest ever British monarch, living to the age of 81. And she was also the youngest ever British (as opposed to English or Scottish) monarch, coming to the throne as a girl of eighteen. And yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her, they seem far more interested in the older Victoria than they do in the young girl; the version of Victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is Judi Dench in \"Mrs Brown\". \"The Young Victoria\" tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign. It has the rare distinction of being produced by a former Royal, Sarah Duchess of York, whose daughter Princess Beatrice makes a brief appearance as an extra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three main strands to the plot. The first concerns the intrigues of Victoria's mother, the Duchess of Kent, a highly unpopular figure even with her own daughter, largely because of the influence of her adviser Sir John Conroy, who was widely rumoured to be her lover. (According to one unfounded rumour he, and not the late Duke of Kent, was Victoria's natural father). The second strand concerns the growing romance between Victoria and her German cousin Prince Albert, and the attempts of King Leopold of Belgium, who was uncle to both of them, to influence this romance. (Leopold's hope was to increase the prestige of the House of Saxe-Coburg, to which both he and Albert belonged). The third concerns one of the strangest episodes in British political history, the Bedchamber Crisis of 1839, when supporters of the Tory Party (which had traditionally supported a strong monarchy) rioted because the young Queen was perceived to favour the Whig Party and their leader Lord Melbourne, even though the Whigs had historically supported a quasi-republican system of government, with the monarch reduced to a figurehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scriptwriter Julian Fellowes is known for his Conservative views, and at times I wondered if this may have coloured his treatment of political themes, as he seems to lean to the side of the Tories, the predecessors of the modern Conservative party. Their leader Robert Peel is shown as statesmanlike and dignified, whereas Melbourne, for all his dash and charm, is shown as devious and uninterested in social reform. There may be some truth is these characterisations, but Fellowes glosses over the fact that only a few years earlier the Tories had opposed the Reform Act, which ended the corrupt electoral system of rotten boroughs, and that they had benefited from William IV's unconstitutional dismissal of a Whig administration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lessons in dynastic and constitutional history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen, and this one contains its share of inaccuracies. Prince Albert, for example, was not injured in Edward Oxford's attempt on Victoria's life, and Melbourne (in his late fifties at the time of Victoria's accession) was not as youthful as he is portrayed here by Paul Bettany. King William IV certainly disliked the Duchess of Kent (who was his sister-in-law), but I doubt if he would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at her during a state banquet, as he is shown doing here. I also failed to understand the significance of the scene in which the Duchess and Conroy try to force Victoria to sign a \"Regency Order\"; the Duchess's constitutional position was made clear by the Regency Act 1830, which provided that she would become Regent if her daughter was still under eighteen at the time of her accession. No piece of paper signed by Victoria could have altered the provisions of the Act.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also occasional infelicities. In one early scene we see Victoria and Albert playing chess while comparing themselves to pawns being moved around a chessboard, a metaphor so hackneyed that the whole scene should have come complete with a \"Danger! Major clichÃ© ahead!\" warning. Yet in spite of scenes like this, I came to enjoy the film. There were some good performances, especially from Miranda Richardson as the scheming Duchess and Mark Strong as the obnoxious Conroy. It is visually very attractive, being shot in sumptuous style we have come to associate with British historical drama. Jim Broadbent gives an amusing turn as King William, although he does occasionally succumb to the temptation of going over the top. (Although not as disastrously over the top as he was in \"Moulin Rouge\").&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason for the film's success, however, is the performances of Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend as the two young lovers Victoria and Albert. Blunt is probably more attractive than Victoria was in real life, but in her delightful portrayal the Queen is no longer the old lady of the popular imagination, the black-clad Widow of Windsor who was perpetually not amused, but a determined, strong-minded and loving young woman. Her love for Albert, and their happy family life together, was one of the main reasons why the monarchy succeeded in reestablishing itself in the affections of the British people. (With the exception of George III, Victoria's Hanoverian ancestors had been notoriously lacking in the matrimonial virtues). Blunt and Friend make \"The Young Victoria\" a touching romance and a gripping human drama as well as an exploration of a key period in British history. 8/10</td>\n",

       "      <td>One of the major successes to The Decline of Western Civilization, filmmaker Penelope Spheeris' indie breakthrough, is that it can perhaps appeal to non-punk fans as to the hardcore ones. More importantly, it captures a moment in history before the movement became completely \"market-worthy\", when bands would play (or, at the least, try to play in some cases) in dank, dirty clubs to an audience that had as much self-respect as they had respect for the bands. For the fan, such as myself, there are precious interviews with some of the quasi-legends of LA's punk-scum, some dead, some still living and still hard-working in the scene. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performances and interviews include the likes of The Circle Jerks, X, Black Flag (in the pre-Henry Rollins days), Catholic Discipline, Fear, the Alice Bag Band, and most memorable (in my opinion) being the Germs. While I knew of a few of the bands and performers in the film (The Jerks and Black Flag mostly), I had only heard rumors about lead singer (the late) Darby Crash, and from the footage in the film he seems to be one of the, if not the, epitomes of the punk movement. He doesn't take himself too seriously, he loves to drink, sometimes when he speaks it's complete gibberish, and the attitude he brings on stage is both funny and in a free-form way exhilarating. A performer like that would probably scare Steve Miller and Jackson Browne out of their skins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decline of Western Civilization may not turn on every non-punk fan that seeks this film out (it's hard to find on video), but it shouldn't necessarily turn them off either. Like a kind of anthropologist that's sneaked into the party, Spheeris gets the behavior of these people down pat, their motives, their likes and hatreds, and the power that was their on and off-screen personas. A few of them almost come off as normal, some don't, but they're only offensive to those who aren't too open to things. On top of that, the film is a must-see to the kinds of kids that think they're punk fans just because they listen to Good Charlotte and Blink-182: if you want to get the real scoop on the movement and genre of rock you profess to love, give the pioneers a chance.

       "      <td>Cut tries to be like most post-Scream slashers tried to be, a spoof of the horror genre that tried to be clever by referencing other famous horror movies. Now, I am not bagging 'Scream,' as I think 'Scream' is a very good horror movie that does a great job of blending horror and comedy. Cut fails on most levels. It has its moments but overall it just does not work out, not even as a \"so bad it's good\" movie, just a below average one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first five minutes or so are OK and set the story fairly well, apart from the fact that Kylie Minogue can't really act, and ironically she gets her tongue out, go figure. Go forward some time and a group of film students want to finish her film off, which is apparently cursed. And, as you have probably predicted, one by one the cast and crew are slowly picked off by a masked madman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unoriginal plot, poor acting and a predictable ending are a few of the elements that follow. There is plenty of referencing in the film, everything from 'Scream' to 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.' This isn't smart either, it feels as though the director wanted to feel smart and cool by mentioning other famous horror flicks ala Scream. For a slasher there is minimal gore and no nudity, which is a huge negative when it comes to a slasher that has not got a whole lot going for it. Really, I should be supporting this movie because I'm Australian and we're not as good when it comes to horror (we do have our gems, though) but Cut is definitely not one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it did keep me watching for the 90 minutes or so, so that is something good at least. I would not recommend this to anyone apart from hardcore slasher fans, who may be able to appreciate what this film is trying to aim for, but if you are looking for a good movie, stay away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/5</td>\n",

Three years ago he was busted/ticketed in his home state doing 70 mph in a 55 mph zone driving NOT a hybrid, a Yugo, or even a GM Metro but a LINCOLN (go google it if you like)! Or how about the fact that Mr. Gore &amp; his Hollywood buddies continue to use a private fuel-guzzling jets to attend the premiers of \"An Inconvenient Truth.\" So much for conservation huh, Al? Anyway, it takes a mere minute to subjectively look at \"An Inconvenient Truth\" &amp; discover the main fundamental flaw. While the film parades out many seemingly impressive scientists to tell the audience the EFFECTS of supposed \"global Warming\" there is not one scientist to tell us the supposed CAUSE of it. For example: I can take a hundred folks out to a parking lot &amp; they can point out an automobile which is not running right. BUT can they tell you with any degree of certainty WHY? Generally not! A second flaw, just how accurate were the weather instruments 100 years ago (the toilet wasn't even invented yet)? What did they have, a June bug in a match box? Hell, even 50-60 years ago? Therefore, how do we know with ANY degree of certainty that the planet is \"getting warmer\" when the records of yesteryear are highly questionable at best? Or that man is THE sole cause of it? The answer is we don't &amp; Science is NEVER a consensus. Thirty years ago, Time Magazine did a cover proclaiming a \"New Ice Age\". The truth is that any 6th grade science teacher well versed in Earth Science will tell you that Volcanic Erruptions, Solar Activity &amp; El Ninos have more to do with our eradicate changes in climate conditions than supposed \"Global Warming.\" Finally, what Al Gore fails to adequately address is; even IF America decides to follow the global gospel according to Al &amp; implement everything he recommends, how are we going to get the rest of the world to follow suit when we can't even get them to agree on something so obvious as terrorism? Answer: It's wishful thinking, Mr. Gore &amp; you being a former VP of the USA know it! If the folks who produced \"An Inconvenient Truth\" were really honest, they would have titled their film \"Al Gore Wants Attention.\" But what I'd really like is for someone to ask the former VP this; why were two of the planet's biggest polluters (AKA China &amp; India) EXEMPT from abiding by the Kyoto Accords?

       "      <td>Nacho Vigalondo is very famous in Spain. He is a kind of bad showman who can make you feel sick... Very embarrassing. Nacho had made some commercials in TV, I remember one in which Nacho was looking for Paul Mc Carney around Madrid (the commercial was about a Mc Carney CD collection). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little movie is like a Nacho's commercial: bad storyline, bad directing, and awful performances. I can't believe that a disgusting movie like this was in The Kodak Theater. Poor Oscar...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nacho could made this movie because of his wife, the producer of this 7:35, a woman very well connected with Spanish TV business men.</td>\n",

       "2273   I saw the movie and really could not stop my tears. Its tragedy that India has no such leaders after freedom, who dare to do justice with their own children, when they don't behave properly.. In current generation, politicians bring their children's into politics without measuring their caliber and skills.. I remember the dialogue from Gandhi 'What kind of society we want to create/make with such people (about Harilal)?' No wonder that it will be a dream that India will hardly have such leader in this or next generation.. Einstein was right when he said about Gandhi that 'After 50 years one would hardly believe that such person with body, soul and mind (Mahatma Gandhi) had ever lived on this earth.' I sincerely want to THANKS a LOT to Anil kapoor, Feroze khan and all film actors/actresses for this wonderful movie about great person and relationship with his son. All father and son should watch this movie once and take some lessons for both roles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "23505  As was mentioned by others, could there be any other reason to see this film other than to see former \"Wayne's World\" star Mike Myers play a serious role? The story line is interesting but lacks development and is sabotaged by loose ends and bad characters. If there was any good scenic shots of Ireland then it would give it another reason to see it. But instead it focuses on a little normal village that is obviously surrounded by the 'green pastures' of the Emerald-Isle that are often shown in Irish films. If there was any cultural 'spice' to admire the \"Irish personality\" it would be worth seeing, however this could have almost been shot in England.

       "3001   Great Balls of Fire is the movie you show to someone you really, really hate. It is absolute torture of the highest rank and is probably used by minions of a foreign power to extract info from captured intelligence agents. I've enjoyed some of Dennis Quaid's performances in the past, but he goes totally over the top in this film. He doesn't so much cross the line, he pole vaults over it, then comes back to jump over and over again. He struts and mugs as if on some incredibly bad acid trip. It's one of those rare performances where you wish you could enter the film and beat the man within an inch of his life for doing something so truly awful. Was he desperate to win a Golden Raspberry or some other award for bad acting? That's the only conclusion I can come up with. Thank you Dennis, you gave us a bad performance for the ages. Where was the director to reign in this guy?<br /><br />The opposite end of the extreme is Winona Ryder, she of the plastic features and plastic acting. I came across a review of her acting style that compared her to a wax dummy. That was of course an insult to wax dummies all over the earth, all of whom could have brough more humanity to the role of Jerry's underage cousin/wife. This brings up the film's mixed up message, that being it is 100% okay to marry your own cousin and have a child by the union. I fail to see what is so \"okay\" about that, but it looks as though Hollywood thinks that underage incest is hunky dory. Talk about \"family values.\"<br /><br />Another problem is the format. Is it a stright forward re telling of Lewis' life, or is it a musical? I'm not talking about the music, I'm talking about the truly weird scene where Jerry drives up to the school, starts to belt out a tune and everyone starts to dance like it was Broadway musical in search of a Tony. Fantasy and reality are thrown together in a mix that does not work. But who really cares? I don't. And neither should you. You can't get back the minutes of life you would waste on this film. So don't waste your time, it's too precious for something this misguided and poor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "59702  This is wild surreal stuff, but brilliant and the camera just kind of sits there and lets you look at this and its like you're going from one room to the next and none of them have any

       "25429  The night of the prom: the most important night to any shallow girl composed almost entirely of plastic. And so the characters kept reminding us every ten minutes when some head-peckingly miniscule event occurred in their miniscule lives.<br /><br />There really is no excuse for Prom Night. There is less than nothing original about it and I truly would have given it zero or less stars were it possible on IMDb. The only part of my viewing that I enjoyed was when a group of teenagers sitting in front of us decided to play a game of 'ghosts'. It was a lot more exciting than whatever was going on on the screen in front of them.<br /><br />The plot was basically some guy going on a rampage. And the thing was, it wasn't even a slightly exciting rampage. Maybe if the guy had been remotely frightening rather than a tame Robbie Williams lookalike with a baseball cap, I might have sat there feeling slightly anxious. The fact that I cared less about the characters than I did about the colour of the cinema carpet didn't really add to the effect, either. And to make matters worse, the rest of the characters were equally one-dimensional and oblivious. The hotel staff didn't seem to notice or care that one of their maids had vanished and are further proof that a murderer is unrecognisable after he has had a shave. I was incredibly surprised that the bitchy, stereotypical girl in the blue dress was the only person to notice who he was. She realises this and then proceeds to fall down the stairs, entangle herself in a plastic sheet and then knock over a pile of paint buckets. Nice one.<br /><br />The worst thing was, I hold the belief that that the director was trying his absolute hardest. He really pushed all boundaries by not showing any killing actually happening. Shocking! And the music, don't even get me started. It was almost as appropriate as stripping at a funeral.<br /><br />I really wish that Prom Night was a joke. It was terrible and stupidly predictable. No one, in their right mind or otherwise, has any reason to see this film. Mainstream cinema seems to be going downhill and films like this worsen the situation. If you get the urge to see this absolutely awful film, hear my plea. Don't do it. There are better things to spend six pounds on. Like a sheet to play ghosts with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "20289  Apart from having the longest reign in British history (63 years), Queen Victoria also holds two other distinctions. She was, apart from our current Queen, the oldest ever British monarch, living to the age of 81. And she was also the youngest ever British (as opposed to English or Scottish) monarch, coming to the throne as a girl of eighteen. And yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her, they seem far more interested in the older Victoria than they do in the young girl; the version of Victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is Judi Dench in \"Mrs Brown\". \"The Young Victoria\" tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign. It has the rare distinction of being produced by a former Royal, Sarah Duchess of York, whose daughter Princess Beatrice makes a brief appearance as an extra.<br /><br />There are three main strands to the plot. The first concerns the intrigues of Victoria's mother, the Duchess of Kent, a highly unpopular figure even with her own daughter, largely because of the influence of her adviser Sir John Conroy, who was widely rumoured to be her lover. (According to one unfounded rumour he, and not the late Duke of Kent, was Victoria's natural father). The second strand concerns the growing romance between Victoria and her German cousin Prince Albert, and the attempts of King Leopold of Belgium, who was uncle to both of them, to influence this romance. (Leopold's hope was to increase the prestige of the House of Saxe-Coburg, to which both he and Albert belonged). The third concerns one of the strangest episodes in British political history, the Bedchamber Crisis of 1839, when supporters of the Tory Party (which had traditionally supported a strong monarchy) rioted because the young Queen was perceived to favour the Whig Party and their leader Lord Melbourne, even though the Whigs had historically supported a quasi-republican system of government, with the monarch reduced to a figurehead.<br /><br />Scriptwriter Julian Fellowes is known for his Conservative views, and at times I wondered if this may have coloured his treatment of political themes, as he seems to lean to the side of the Tories, the predecessors of the modern Conservative party. Their leader Robert Peel is shown as statesmanlike and dignified, whereas Melbourne, for all his dash and charm, is shown as devious and uninterested in social reform. There may be some truth is these characterisations, but Fellowes glosses over the fact that only a few years earlier the Tories had opposed the Reform Act, which ended the corrupt electoral system of rotten boroughs, and that they had benefited from William IV's unconstitutional dismissal of a Whig administration.<br /><br />Lessons in dynastic and constitutional history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen, and this one contains its share of inaccuracies. Prince Albert, for example, was not injured in Edward Oxford's attempt on Victoria's life, and Melbourne (in his late fifties at the time of Victoria's accession) was not as youthful as he is portrayed here by Paul Bettany. King William IV certainly disliked the Duchess of Kent (who was his sister-in-law), but I doubt if he would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at her during a state banquet, as he is shown doing here. I also failed to understand the significance of the scene in which the Duchess and Conroy try to force Victoria to sign a \"Regency Order\"; the Duchess's constitutional position was made clear by the Regency Act 1830, which provided that she would become Regent if her daughter was still under eighteen at the time of her accession. No piece of paper signed by Victoria could have altered the provisions of the Act.<br /><br />There are also occasional infelicities. In one early scene we see Victoria and Albert playing chess while comparing themselves to pawns being moved around a chessboard, a metaphor so hackneyed that the whole scene should have come complete with a \"Danger! Major clichÃ© ahead!\" warning. Yet in spite of scenes like this, I came to enjoy the film. There were some good performances, especially from Miranda Richardson as the scheming Duchess and Mark Strong as the obnoxious Conroy. It is visually very attractive, being shot in sumptuous style we have come to associate with British historical drama. Jim Broadbent gives an amusing turn as King William, although he does occasionally succumb to the temptation of going over the top. (Although not as disastrously over the top as he was in \"Moulin Rouge\").<br /><br />The main reason for the film's success, however, is the performances of Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend as the two young lovers Victoria and Albert. Blunt is probably more attractive than Victoria was in real life, but in her delightful portrayal the Queen is no longer the old lady of the popular imagination, the black-clad Widow of Windsor who was perpetually not amused, but a determined, strong-minded and loving young woman. Her love for Albert, and their happy family life together, was one of the main reasons why the monarchy succeeded in reestablishing itself in the affections of the British people. (With the exception of George III, Victoria's Hanoverian ancestors had been notoriously lacking in the matrimonial virtues). Blunt and Friend make \"The Young Victoria\" a touching romance and a gripping human drama as well as an exploration of a key period in British history. 8/10   \n",
       "32217  Helena Bonham Carter is the center of this movie. She plays her role almost immobile in a wheelchair but still brings across her traditional intensity. Kenneth Branagh was tolerable. The movie itself was good not exceptional.

       "5473   One of the major successes to The Decline of Western Civilization, filmmaker Penelope Spheeris' indie breakthrough, is that it can perhaps appeal to non-punk fans as to the hardcore ones. More importantly, it captures a moment in history before the movement became completely \"market-worthy\", when bands would play (or, at the least, try to play in some cases) in dank, dirty clubs to an audience that had as much self-respect as they had respect for the bands. For the fan, such as myself, there are precious interviews with some of the quasi-legends of LA's punk-scum, some dead, some still living and still hard-working in the scene. <br /><br />Performances and interviews include the likes of The Circle Jerks, X, Black Flag (in the pre-Henry Rollins days), Catholic Discipline, Fear, the Alice Bag Band, and most memorable (in my opinion) being the Germs. While I knew of a few of the bands and performers in the film (The Jerks and Black Flag mostly), I had only heard rumors about lead singer (the late) Darby Crash, and from the footage in the film he seems to be one of the, if not the, epitomes of the punk movement. He doesn't take himself too seriously, he loves to drink, sometimes when he speaks it's complete gibberish, and the attitude he brings on stage is both funny and in a free-form way exhilarating. A performer like that would probably scare Steve Miller and Jackson Browne out of their skins.<br /><br />Decline of Western Civilization may not turn on every non-punk fan that seeks this film out (it's hard to find on video), but it shouldn't necessarily turn them off either. Like a kind of anthropologist that's sneaked into the party, Spheeris gets the behavior of these people down pat, their motives, their likes and hatreds, and the power that was their on and off-screen personas. A few of them almost come off as normal, some don't, but they're only offensive to those who aren't too open to things. On top of that, the film is a must-see to the kinds of kids that think they're punk fans just because they listen to Good Charlotte and Blink-182: if you want to get the real scoop on the movement and genre of rock you profess to love, give the pioneers a chance.

       "12128  This movie is amazing. You will NEVER laugh harder. It's a target. No, I think it's...yes it's...A BOOB! This movie gets funnier by the second--like when Jackie Chan's character finally dies in his final fight scene. This movie is velly velly seekwet like treasha! Congrats if you buy or rent this. You'll never return it, in my opinion. I didn't, and I haven't found it in a store since. I watched this movie once and I was forever in love with Kung-Fu action flicks. If you're looking for an amazing film in the realm of great production value, good or even mediocre acting, and good special effects...this is NOT that movie. If you're looking for laughs and timeless wonderment, pick this up for a dollar and you'll probably never let it go. With friends, popcorn and drinks, it's the perfect evening.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "26544  Cut tries to be like most post-Scream slashers tried to be, a spoof of the horror genre that tried to be clever by referencing other famous horror movies. Now, I am not bagging 'Scream,' as I think 'Scream' is a very good horror movie that does a great job of blending horror and comedy. Cut fails on most levels. It has its moments but overall it just does not work out, not even as a \"so bad it's good\" movie, just a below average one.<br /><br />The first five minutes or so are OK and set the story fairly well, apart from the fact that Kylie Minogue can't really act, and ironically she gets her tongue out, go figure. Go forward some time and a group of film students want to finish her film off, which is apparently cursed. And, as you have probably predicted, one by one the cast and crew are slowly picked off by a masked madman.<br /><br />Unoriginal plot, poor acting and a predictable ending are a few of the elements that follow. There is plenty of referencing in the film, everything from 'Scream' to 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.' This isn't smart either, it feels as though the director wanted to feel smart and cool by mentioning other famous horror flicks ala Scream. For a slasher there is minimal gore and no nudity, which is a huge negative when it comes to a slasher that has not got a whole lot going for it. Really, I should be supporting this movie because I'm Australian and we're not as good when it comes to horror (we do have our gems, though) but Cut is definitely not one of them.<br /><br />However, it did keep me watching for the 90 minutes or so, so that is something good at least. I would not recommend this to anyone apart from hardcore slasher fans, who may be able to appreciate what this film is trying to aim for, but if you are looking for a good movie, stay away.<br /><br />2/5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "37785  ****MINOR SPOILERS*** As a bad movie connoisseur I must have viewed hundreds of bad movies and yet \"Hobgoblins\" stands apart from all others in it's own unique way. Classic baddies such as \"The Creeping Terror,\" \"The Mighty Gorga\" and \"Manos\" are uniformly bad from start to finish. \"Hobgoblins\" on the other hand, starts off bad and gets progressively worse as it goes. During my first viewing of the infamous rake fight scene I thought to myself that this was a truly bad film. I was blissfully unaware that I had just seen the best that this movie had to offer. The movie takes its most massive nosedive into celluloid hell during the painfully inept \"Club Scum\" sequence which is a continuous string of one unfunny joke after another. With just this one film, director Rick Sloane proves that he deserves mention alongside the likes of Coleman Francis and Bill Rebane as one of the worst directors of all time. How bad can a bad movie be?

There's an ebb and flow to his writing and there's also the sense that tragedy is inevitable.

       "24639  This was a real let down for me. The original Bride with White Hair is a great kung fu fantasy film but this one was pretty weak. I didn't care at all for the new characters who unfortunately dominated the screen time and the story wasn't well developed. While the first film was tragic and involving this one was tedious (as I merely counted the time to the end when the ill-fated lovers would actually meet). The action was poor in this one as well. The fights were not choreographed very well and there really wasn't much kung-fu at all. Just a few weak sword fights between the highly dis-likable Lui and one of Lin's henchwomen. Lin herself mainly uses a sort of telekinesis to throw people into walls and sometimes her hair, a far cry from the impressive showing with the whip and kung-fu she displayed in the previous film. I still gave this movie a 4 because at least it was fast pace and I did want to see what was going to happen at the end, though I (as most anyone who watched the first one) predicted it would go down the way it did and after seeing it I found it anti-climactic and wished they had either made a proper sequel or just left the story alone. I really recommend the first one but as for the sequel only fans of the genre and those who really want to see Lin as the bride one more time need apply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "19157  My girlfriend and I have a thing for Robots. So I try to seek out movies that have robots. And this movie has robots. Big ones. They beat the clang and bang out of each other, with the fate of nations hanging in the balance. It's really cool. You have to forgive this movie its many shortcomings and just try to appreciate what the director and his crew of technicians were able to put on the screen while working with what was obviously a tight budget. It is very hard to dislike this movie. Because of those big robots. They looked like Transformers and they fought like pro wrestlers! It made my girlfriend smile. And that is good enough for me. And special mention must be made of veteran character actor Paul Koslo: as the maniacal Russian Villain, whether he is ruthlessly stomping on his helpless opponents after they've already surrendered or complaining that their close proximity to him in a bar has caused his vodka to taste \"like blood\" (a line he delivers with a deliciously campy sub-Bela Lugosi accent) he is clearly having a ball and the film benefits enormously whenever he is on-screen. This is a nifty little flick that deserves its cult reputation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "1892   Let's be honest shall we? Al Gore no more TRULY cares about the environment than most folks care about contacting foot fungus. It's a hook! Make no mistake, Al Gore is a POLITICIAN! Three years ago he was busted/ticketed in his home state doing 70 mph in a 55 mph zone driving NOT a hybrid, a Yugo, or even a GM Metro but a LINCOLN (go google it if you like)! Or how about the fact that Mr. Gore & his Hollywood buddies continue to use a private fuel-guzzling jets to attend the premiers of \"An Inconvenient Truth.\" So much for conservation huh, Al? Anyway, it takes a mere minute to subjectively look at \"An Inconvenient Truth\" & discover the main fundamental flaw. While the film parades out many seemingly impressive scientists to tell the audience the EFFECTS of supposed \"global Warming\" there is not one scientist to tell us the supposed CAUSE of it. For example: I can take a hundred folks out to a parking lot & they can point out an automobile which is not running right. BUT can they tell you with any degree of certainty WHY? Generally not! A second flaw, just how accurate were the weather instruments 100 years ago (the toilet wasn't even invented yet)? What did they have, a June bug in a match box? Hell, even 50-60 years ago? Therefore, how do we know with ANY degree of certainty that the planet is \"getting warmer\" when the records of yesteryear are highly questionable at best? Or that man is THE sole cause of it? The answer is we don't & Science is NEVER a consensus. Thirty years ago, Time Magazine did a cover proclaiming a \"New Ice Age\". The truth is that any 6th grade science teacher well versed in Earth Science will tell you that Volcanic Erruptions, Solar Activity & El Ninos have more to do with our eradicate changes in climate conditions than supposed \"Global Warming.\" Finally, what Al Gore fails to adequately address is; even IF America decides to follow the global gospel according to Al & implement everything he recommends, how are we going to get the rest of the world to follow suit when we can't even get them to agree on something so obvious as terrorism? Answer: It's wishful thinking, Mr. Gore & you being a former VP of the USA know it! If the folks who produced \"An Inconvenient Truth\" were really honest, they would have titled their film \"Al Gore Wants Attention.\" But what I'd really like is for someone to ask the former VP this; why were two of the planet's biggest polluters (AKA China & India) EXEMPT from abiding by the Kyoto Accords? Anyway, I hear the producers of A.I.T are working on their next film entitled \"Gnomes, Fairies & Elves: Our Endangered Friends.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "18534  This isn't exactly a great film, but I admire the writers and director for trying something a little different. The film's main theme is fate and small, seemingly insignificant things that can greatly change the future. In some ways this reminds me of the film SLIDING DOORS, though instead of focusing on one random event, seemingly random stuff happens repeatedly and each one helps build to the cute conclusion. Plus, an odd bald guy seems to understand all this and he talks about this during one brief scene--like he's some sort of omnipotent being but there's absolutely no explanation of him in the film (like the two guys that fight each other in the clock tower in THE HUDSUCKER PROXY).<br /><br />The DVD jacket shows just Audrey Tautou. This is capitalize on her success in AMELIE, though she is only one of many actors in the film and there is no one starring role. The pace is brisk, the acting fine and the conclusion isn't bad at all. The only reason I didn't score it higher is that some of the characters were a bit uninteresting and I think the movie could have perhaps been tightened up with a few less subplots.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "9468   I usually try to be professional and constructive when I criticize movies, but my GOD!!! This was THE worst movie I have ever seen. Bad acting, bad effects, bad script, bad everything! <br /><br />The plot follows a group of teen cliche's on their way to a rave (that takes place in broad daylight) at a remote island. However, when the group arrives, all they find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes. Determined to find out what happened to the rest of the party-goers, the clan set's off on a mission through a zombie-infested forest. During this crusade, they are aided by a police chick and a sea captain that just happens to have the right number of weapons to give to each of the kids. They also meet up with Jonathan Cherry and some other survivors. Basically the rest of the movie is a collection of poorly directed action sequences including a far too long shootout outside of the \"house of the dead.\" This fight came complete with cheesy Hollywood violence, redundant clips from the HOTD video game, and sloppy matrix-esque camera rotations. One of the character's even volunteers to sacrifice himself to save the others. Why? Not because he was noble and brave, but because part of his face got scarred by acid a zombie spat on him after he continued to beat the creature long after it had been disabled! I'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy?!?<br /><br />To sum it all up, there is absolutely no point in seeing this movie unless you want to see for yourself just how terrible it is. The theater I was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen, and I'm sure the money I wasted seeing this piece of sh*t could easily cover the costs it took to make it.

       "4986   In the winter of 1931, supposedly 12-year-old Tyler Hoechlin (as Michael Sullivan Jr.) wonders what his mobster father Tom Hanks (Michael \"Mike\" Sullivan) does for a living. Young Hoechlin follows Mr. Hanks to \"work\" one evening, and witnesses him blasting away some rival gangsters. This leads - in a VERY roundabout way - to \"Godfather\"-type Paul Newman (as John Rooney) hiring independent hit-man Jude Law (as Harlen Maguire) to track down Hoechlin and Hanks, who are off to cool their heels in Chicago. Hanks thinks they will be safe with a relative, which is puzzling when you consider the characters' line of work.<br /><br />Looking uncannily like Paul Peterson (\"The Donna Reed Show\"), Hoechlin does a terrific job for director Sam Mendes; and, getting to work with this cast makes him the luckiest young actor of 2002. But, the most striking thing about \"Road to Perdition\" is the stunning cinematography of Conrad L. Hall, which deservedly won a career capping \"Academy Award\" for the late photographer. Mr. Hall's work is truly superlative. This helps make up for the overall impression of a measured, contrived staginess to both the narrative and visuals. The deviating end is abruptly uplifting (the unrelated dog is an example of the aforementioned staginess).<br /><br />******** Road to Perdition (7/12/02) Sam Mendes ~ Tom Hanks, Tyler Hoechlin, Paul Newman, Jude Law                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "388    Not only does this movie have a poor plot, bad direction, and terrible acting, its opens up a whole new meaning to racism.<br /><br />In this film \"White\" chicks are the sluts, \"White\" boys are the wana-be gangsters, and successful (yes again) \"White\" businessmen are revolting toilet shitters.<br /><br />I just wonder what would happen if I made the exact same movie with the exact same story line and script, only I made it about Caucasians. \"He dude, its good to finally see your've stopped dating those black chicks\".<br /><br />Nobody seems to notice it, but watch this film again and you'll vomit at how they have portrayed the new Zealand \"white boys\". All of a sudden its white folks who are the main cause of gang aggression, and whores out for a quick bang. Only Samoans girls have a heart, there's no such thing as a non-slutty white girl.<br /><br />It disgusts me that they couldn't make this film without giving the Caucasian community in New Zealand a repulsive profile. If you think I'm overgeneralizing, go watch this film, and see what you make of the \"white boys\". Just because Samoans choose to call us \"white boys\" in actual life, doesn't mean its funny. If I said hey black boy I'll loose my teeth.<br /><br />Don't see this movie. Don't waste your money. Don't be racist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "29149  Nacho Vigalondo is very famous in Spain. He is a kind of bad showman who can make you feel sick... Very embarrassing. Nacho had made some commercials in TV, I remember one in which Nacho was looking for Paul Mc Carney around Madrid (the commercial was about a Mc Carney CD collection). <br /><br />This little movie is like a Nacho's commercial: bad storyline, bad directing, and awful performances. I can't believe that a disgusting movie like this was in The Kodak Theater. Poor Oscar...<br /><br />Nacho could made this movie because of his wife, the producer of this 7:35, a woman very well connected with Spanish TV business men.

       "2273   i saw the movie and really could not stop my tears . its tragedy that india has no such leaders after freedom , who dare to do justice with their own children , when they don_`_t behave properly .. in current generation , politicians bring their children's into politics without measuring their caliber and skills .. i remember the dialogue from gandhi ' what kind of society we want to create / make with such people ( about harilal ) ? ' no wonder that it will be a dream that india will hardly have such leader in this or next generation .. einstein was right when he said about gandhi that ' after 50 years one would hardly believe that such person with body , soul and mind ( mahatma gandhi ) had ever lived on this earth . ' i sincerely want to thanks a lot to anil kapoor , feroze khan and all film actors / actresses for this wonderful movie about great person and relationship with his son . all father and son should watch this movie once and take some lessons for both roles .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "23505  as was mentioned by others , could there be any other reason to see this film other than to see former \" wayne's world \" star mike myers play a serious role ? the story line is interesting but lacks development and is sabotaged by loose ends and bad characters . if there was any good scenic shots of ireland then it would give it another reason to see it . but instead it focuses on a little normal village that is obviously surrounded by the ' green pastures ' of the emerald-isle that are often shown in irish films . if there was any cultural ' spice ' to admire the \" irish personality \" it would be worth seeing , however this could have almost been shot in england . too bad for myers , but this one fails to please or satisfy the heart of anybody who ever wanted to visit the land of guiness .

       "3001   great balls of fire is the movie you show to someone you really , really hate . it is absolute torture of the highest rank and is probably used by minions of a foreign power to extract info from captured intelligence agents . i've enjoyed some of dennis quaid's performances in the past , but he goes totally over the top in this film . he doesn_`_t so much cross the line , he pole vaults over it , then comes back to jump over and over again . he struts and mugs as if on some incredibly bad acid trip . it's one of those rare performances where you wish you could enter the film and beat the man within an inch of his life for doing something so truly awful . was he desperate to win a golden raspberry or some other award for bad acting ? that's the only conclusion i can come up with . thank you dennis , you gave us a bad performance for the ages . where was the director to reign in this guy ? the opposite end of the extreme is winona ryder , she of the plastic features and plastic acting . i came across a review of her acting style that compared her to a wax dummy . that was of course an insult to wax dummies all over the earth , all of whom could have brough more humanity to the role of jerry's underage cousin / wife . this brings up the film's mixed up message , that being it is 100 % okay to marry your own cousin and have a child by the union . i fail to see what is so \" okay \" about that , but it looks as though hollywood thinks that underage incest is hunky dory . talk about \" family values . \" another problem is the format . is it a stright forward re telling of lewis ' life , or is it a musical ? i'm not talking about the music , i'm talking about the truly weird scene where jerry drives up to the school , starts to belt out a tune and everyone starts to dance like it was broadway musical in search of a tony . fantasy and reality are thrown together in a mix that does not work . but who really cares ? i don_`_t . and neither should you . you can't get back the minutes of life you would waste on this film . so don_`_t waste your time , it's too precious for something this misguided and poor .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "25429  the night of the prom : the most important night to any shallow girl composed almost entirely of plastic . and so the characters kept reminding us every ten minutes when some head-peckingly miniscule event occurred in their miniscule lives . there really is no excuse for prom night . there is less than nothing original about it and i truly would have given it zero or less stars were it possible on imdb . the only part of my viewing that i enjoyed was when a group of teenagers sitting in front of us decided to play a game of ' ghosts ' . it was a lot more exciting than whatever was going on on the screen in front of them . the plot was basically some guy going on a rampage . and the thing was , it wasn_`_t even a slightly exciting rampage . maybe if the guy had been remotely frightening rather than a tame robbie williams lookalike with a baseball cap , i might have sat there feeling slightly anxious . the fact that i cared less about the characters than i did about the colour of the cinema carpet didn_`_t really add to the effect , either . and to make matters worse , the rest of the characters were equally one-dimensional and oblivious . the hotel staff didn_`_t seem to notice or care that one of their maids had vanished and are further proof that a murderer is unrecognisable after he has had a shave . i was incredibly surprised that the bitchy , stereotypical girl in the blue dress was the only person to notice who he was . she realises this and then proceeds to fall down the stairs , entangle herself in a plastic sheet and then knock over a pile of paint buckets . nice one . the worst thing was , i hold the belief that that the director was trying his absolute hardest . he really pushed all boundaries by not showing any killing actually happening . shocking ! and the music , don_`_t even get me started . it was almost as appropriate as stripping at a funeral . i really wish that prom night was a joke . it was terrible and stupidly predictable . no one , in their right mind or otherwise , has any reason to see this film . mainstream cinema seems to be going downhill and films like this worsen the situation . if you get the urge to see this absolutely awful film , hear my plea . don_`_t do it . there are better things to spend six pounds on . like a sheet to play ghosts with .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "20289  apart from having the longest reign in british history ( 63 years ) , queen victoria also holds two other distinctions . she was , apart from our current queen , the oldest ever british monarch , living to the age of 81 . and she was also the youngest ever british ( as opposed to english or scottish ) monarch , coming to the throne as a girl of eighteen . and yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her , they seem far more interested in the older victoria than they do in the young girl ; the version of victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is judi dench in \" mrs brown \" . \" the young victoria \" tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign . it has the rare distinction of being produced by a former royal , sarah duchess of york , whose daughter princess beatrice makes a brief appearance as an extra . there are three main strands to the plot . the first concerns the intrigues of victoria's mother , the duchess of kent , a highly unpopular figure even with her own daughter , largely because of the influence of her adviser sir john conroy , who was widely rumoured to be her lover . ( according to one unfounded rumour he , and not the late duke of kent , was victoria's natural father ) . the second strand concerns the growing romance between victoria and her german cousin prince albert , and the attempts of king leopold of belgium , who was uncle to both of them , to influence this romance . ( leopold's hope was to increase the prestige of the house of saxe-coburg , to which both he and albert belonged ) . the third concerns one of the strangest episodes in british political history , the bedchamber crisis of 1839 , when supporters of the tory party ( which had traditionally supported a strong monarchy ) rioted because the young queen was perceived to favour the whig party and their leader lord melbourne , even though the whigs had historically supported a quasi-republican system of government , with the monarch reduced to a figurehead . scriptwriter julian fellowes is known for his conservative views , and at times i wondered if this may have coloured his treatment of political themes , as he seems to lean to the side of the tories , the predecessors of the modern conservative party . their leader robert peel is shown as statesmanlike and dignified , whereas melbourne , for all his dash and charm , is shown as devious and uninterested in social reform . there may be some truth is these characterisations , but fellowes glosses over the fact that only a few years earlier the tories had opposed the reform act , which ended the corrupt electoral system of rotten boroughs , and that they had benefited from william iv's unconstitutional dismissal of a whig administration . lessons in dynastic and constitutional history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen , and this one contains its share of inaccuracies . prince albert , for example , was not injured in edward oxford's attempt on victoria's life , and melbourne ( in his late fifties at the time of victoria's accession ) was not as youthful as he is portrayed here by paul bettany . king william iv certainly disliked the duchess of kent ( who was his sister-in-law ) , but i doubt if he would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at her during a state banquet , as he is shown doing here . i also failed to understand the significance of the scene in which the duchess and conroy try to force victoria to sign a \" regency order \" ; the duchess's constitutional position was made clear by the regency act 1830 , which provided that she would become regent if her daughter was still under eighteen at the time of her accession . no piece of paper signed by victoria could have altered the provisions of the act . there are also occasional infelicities . in one early scene we see victoria and albert playing chess while comparing themselves to pawns being moved around a chessboard , a metaphor so hackneyed that the whole scene should have come complete with a \" danger ! major clichã © ahead ! \" warning . yet in spite of scenes like this , i came to enjoy the film . there were some good performances , especially from miranda richardson as the scheming duchess and mark strong as the obnoxious conroy . it is visually very attractive , being shot in sumptuous style we have come to associate with british historical drama . jim broadbent gives an amusing turn as king william , although he does occasionally succumb to the temptation of going over the top . ( although not as disastrously over the top as he was in \" moulin rouge \" ) . the main reason for the film's success , however , is the performances of emily blunt and rupert friend as the two young lovers victoria and albert . blunt is probably more attractive than victoria was in real life , but in her delightful portrayal the queen is no longer the old lady of the popular imagination , the black-clad widow of windsor who was perpetually not amused , but a determined , strong-minded and loving young woman . her love for albert , and their happy family life together , was one of the main reasons why the monarchy succeeded in reestablishing itself in the affections of the british people . ( with the exception of george iii , victoria's hanoverian ancestors had been notoriously lacking in the matrimonial virtues ) . blunt and friend make \" the young victoria \" a touching romance and a gripping human drama as well as an exploration of a key period in british history . 8/ 10   \n",

       "5473   one of the major successes to the decline of western civilization , filmmaker penelope spheeris ' indie breakthrough , is that it can perhaps appeal to non-punk fans as to the hardcore ones . more importantly , it captures a moment in history before the movement became completely \" market-worthy \" , when bands would play ( or , at the least , try to play in some cases ) in dank , dirty clubs to an audience that had as much self-respect as they had respect for the bands . for the fan , such as myself , there are precious interviews with some of the quasi-legends of la's punk-scum , some dead , some still living and still hard-working in the scene . performances and interviews include the likes of the circle jerks , x , black flag ( in the pre-henry rollins days ) , catholic discipline , fear , the alice bag band , and most memorable ( in my opinion ) being the germs . while i knew of a few of the bands and performers in the film ( the jerks and black flag mostly ) , i had only heard rumors about lead singer ( the late ) darby crash , and from the footage in the film he seems to be one of the , if not the , epitomes of the punk movement . he doesn_`_t take himself too seriously , he loves to drink , sometimes when he speaks it's complete gibberish , and the attitude he brings on stage is both funny and in a free-form way exhilarating . a performer like that would probably scare steve miller and jackson browne out of their skins . decline of western civilization may not turn on every non-punk fan that seeks this film out ( it's hard to find on video ) , but it shouldn_`_t necessarily turn them off either . like a kind of anthropologist that's sneaked into the party , spheeris gets the behavior of these people down pat , their motives , their likes and hatreds , and the power that was their on and off-screen personas . a few of them almost come off as normal , some don_`_t , but they're only offensive to those who aren_`_t too open to things . on top of that , the film is a must-see to the kinds of kids that think they're punk fans just because they listen to good charlotte and blink -

       "12128  this movie is amazing . you will never laugh harder . it's a target . no , i think it's ... yes it's ... a boob ! this movie gets funnier by the second--like when jackie chan's character finally dies in his final fight scene . this movie is velly velly seekwet like treasha ! congrats if you buy or rent this . you'll never return it , in my opinion . i didn_`_t , and i haven't found it in a store since . i watched this movie once and i was forever in love with kung-fu action flicks . if you're looking for an amazing film in the realm of great production value , good or even mediocre acting , and good special effects ... this is not that movie . if you're looking for laughs and timeless wonderment , pick this up for a dollar and you'll probably never let it go .

       "26544  cut tries to be like most post-scream slashers tried to be , a spoof of the horror genre that tried to be clever by referencing other famous horror movies . now , i am not bagging ' scream , ' as i think ' scream ' is a very good horror movie that does a great job of blending horror and comedy . cut fails on most levels . it has its moments but overall it just does not work out , not even as a \" so bad it's good \" movie , just a below average one . the first five minutes or so are ok and set the story fairly well , apart from the fact that kylie minogue can't really act , and ironically she gets her tongue out , go figure . go forward some time and a group of film students want to finish her film off , which is apparently cursed . and , as you have probably predicted , one by one the cast and crew are slowly picked off by a masked madman . unoriginal plot , poor acting and a predictable ending are a few of the elements that follow . there is plenty of referencing in the film , everything from ' scream ' to ' the texas chain saw massacre . ' this isn_`_t smart either , it feels as though the director wanted to feel smart and cool by mentioning other famous horror flicks ala scream . for a slasher there is minimal gore and no nudity , which is a huge negative when it comes to a slasher that has not got a whole lot going for it . really , i should be supporting this movie because i'm australian and we're not as good when it comes to horror ( we do have our gems , though ) but cut is definitely not one of them . however , it did keep me watching for the 90 minutes or so , so that is something good at least . i would not recommend this to anyone apart from hardcore slasher fans , who may be able to appreciate what this film is trying to aim for , but if you are looking for a good movie , stay away . 2/5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "37785  * * * minor spoilers * * * as a bad movie connoisseur i must have viewed hundreds of bad movies and yet \" hobgoblins \" stands apart from all others in it's own unique way . classic baddies such as \" the creeping terror , \" \" the mighty gorga \" and \" manos \" are uniformly bad from start to finish . \" hobgoblins \" on the other hand , starts off bad and gets progressively worse as it goes . during my first viewing of the infamous rake fight scene i thought to myself that this was a truly bad film . i was blissfully unaware that i had just seen the best that this movie had to offer . the movie takes its most massive nosedive into celluloid hell during the painfully inept \" club scum \" sequence which is a continuous string of one unfunny joke after another . with just this one film , director rick sloane proves that he deserves mention alongside the likes of coleman francis and bill rebane as one of the worst directors of all time . how bad can a bad movie be ?

       "24639  this was a real let down for me . the original bride with white hair is a great kung fu fantasy film but this one was pretty weak . i didn_`_t care at all for the new characters who unfortunately dominated the screen time and the story wasn_`_t well developed . while the first film was tragic and involving this one was tedious ( as i merely counted the time to the end when the ill-fated lovers would actually meet ) . the action was poor in this one as well . the fights were not choreographed very well and there really wasn_`_t much kung-fu at all . just a few weak sword fights between the highly dis-likable lui and one of lin's henchwomen . lin herself mainly uses a sort of telekinesis to throw people into walls and sometimes her hair , a far cry from the impressive showing with the whip and kung-fu she displayed in the previous film . i still gave this movie a 4 because at least it was fast pace and i did want to see what was going to happen at the end , though i ( as most anyone who watched the first one ) predicted it would go down the way it did and after seeing it i found it anti-climactic and wished they had either made a proper sequel or just left the story alone . i really recommend the first one but as for the sequel only fans of the genre and those who really want to see lin as the bride one more time need apply .

       "19157  my girlfriend and i have a thing for robots . so i try to seek out movies that have robots . and this movie has robots . big ones . they beat the clang and bang out of each other , with the fate of nations hanging in the balance . it's really cool . you have to forgive this movie its many shortcomings and just try to appreciate what the director and his crew of technicians were able to put on the screen while working with what was obviously a tight budget . it is very hard to dislike this movie . because of those big robots . they looked like transformers and they fought like pro wrestlers ! it made my girlfriend smile . and that is good enough for me . and special mention must be made of veteran character actor paul koslo : as the maniacal russian villain , whether he is ruthlessly stomping on his helpless opponents after they've already surrendered or complaining that their close proximity to him in a bar has caused his vodka to taste \" like blood \" ( a line he delivers with a deliciously campy sub-bela lugosi accent ) he is clearly having a ball and the film benefits enormously whenever he is on-screen . this is a nifty little flick that deserves its cult reputation .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "1892   let's be honest shall we ? al gore no more truly cares about the environment than most folks care about contacting foot fungus . it's a hook ! make no mistake , al gore is a politician ! three years ago he was busted / ticketed in his home state doing 70 mph in a 55 mph zone driving not a hybrid , a yugo , or even a gm metro but a lincoln ( go google it if you like ) ! or how about the fact that mr . gore & his hollywood buddies continue to use a private fuel-guzzling jets to attend the premiers of \" an inconvenient truth . \" so much for conservation huh , al ? anyway , it takes a mere minute to subjectively look at \" an inconvenient truth \" & discover the main fundamental flaw . while the film parades out many seemingly impressive scientists to tell the audience the effects of supposed \" global warming \" there is not one scientist to tell us the supposed cause of it . for example : i can take a hundred folks out to a parking lot & they can point out an automobile which is not running right . but can they tell you with any degree of certainty why ? generally not ! a second flaw , just how accurate were the weather instruments 100 years ago ( the toilet wasn_`_t even invented yet ) ? what did they have , a june bug in a match box ? hell , even 50-60 years ago ? therefore , how do we know with any degree of certainty that the planet is \" getting warmer \" when the records of yesteryear are highly questionable at best ? or that man is the sole cause of it ? the answer is we don_`_t & science is never a consensus . thirty years ago , time magazine did a cover proclaiming a \" new ice age \" . the truth is that any 6th grade science teacher well versed in earth science will tell you that volcanic erruptions , solar activity & el ninos have more to do with our eradicate changes in climate conditions than supposed \" global warming . \" finally , what al gore fails to adequately address is ; even if america decides to follow the global gospel according to al & implement everything he recommends , how are we going to get the rest of the world to follow suit when we can't even get them to agree on something so obvious as terrorism ? answer : it's wishful thinking , mr . gore & you being a former vp of the usa know it ! if the folks who produced \" an inconvenient truth \" were really honest , they would have titled their film \" al gore wants attention . \" but what i'd really like is for someone to ask the former vp this ; why were two of the planet's biggest polluters ( aka china & india ) exempt from abiding by the kyoto accords ? anyway , i hear the producers of a . i . t are working on their next film entitled \" gnomes , fairies & elves : our endangered friends . \"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "18534  this isn_`_t exactly a great film , but i admire the writers and director for trying something a little different . the film's main theme is fate and small , seemingly insignificant things that can greatly change the future . in some ways this reminds me of the film sliding doors , though instead of focusing on one random event , seemingly random stuff happens repeatedly and each one helps build to the cute conclusion . plus , an odd bald guy seems to understand all this and he talks about this during one brief scene--like he's some sort of omnipotent being but there's absolutely no explanation of him in the film ( like the two guys that fight each other in the clock tower in the hudsucker proxy ) . the dvd jacket shows just audrey tautou . this is capitalize on her success in amelie , though she is only one of many actors in the film and there is no one starring role . the pace is brisk , the acting fine and the conclusion isn_`_t bad at all . the only reason i didn_`_t score it higher is that some of the characters were a bit uninteresting and i think the movie could have perhaps been tightened up with a few less subplots .

       "9468   i usually try to be professional and constructive when i criticize movies , but my god ! ! ! this was the worst movie i have ever seen . bad acting , bad effects , bad script , bad everything ! the plot follows a group of teen cliche's on their way to a rave ( that takes place in broad daylight ) at a remote island . however , when the group arrives , all they find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes . determined to find out what happened to the rest of the party-goers , the clan set's off on a mission through a zombie-infested forest . during this crusade , they are aided by a police chick and a sea captain that just happens to have the right number of weapons to give to each of the kids . they also meet up with jonathan cherry and some other survivors . basically the rest of the movie is a collection of poorly directed action sequences including a far too long shootout outside of the \" house of the dead . \" this fight came complete with cheesy hollywood violence , redundant clips from the hotd video game , and sloppy matrix-esque camera rotations . one of the character's even volunteers to sacrifice himself to save the others . why ? not because he was noble and brave , but because part of his face got scarred by acid a zombie spat on him after he continued to beat the creature long after it had been disabled ! i'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy ? ! ? to sum it all up , there is absolutely no point in seeing this movie unless you want to see for yourself just how terrible it is . the theater i was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen , and i'm sure the money i wasted seeing this piece of sh * t could easily cover the costs it took to make it . grade : f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

\" boys are the wana-be gangsters , and successful ( yes again ) \" white \" businessmen are revolting toilet shitters . i just wonder what would happen if i made the exact same movie with the exact same story line and script , only i made it about caucasians . \" he dude , its good to finally see your've stopped dating those black chicks \" . nobody seems to notice it , but watch this film again and you'll vomit at how they have portrayed the new zealand \" white boys \" . all of a sudden its white folks who are the main cause of gang aggression , and whores out for a quick bang . only samoans girls have a heart , there's no such thing as a non-slutty white girl . it disgusts me that they couldn_`_t make this film without giving the caucasian community in new zealand a repulsive profile . if you think i'm overgeneralizing , go watch this film , and see what you make of the \" white boys \" . just because samoans choose to call us \" white boys \" in actual life , doesn_`_t mean its funny . if i said hey black boy i'll loose my teeth . don_`_t see this movie . don_`_t waste your money . don_`_t be racist .

       "29149  nacho vigalondo is very famous in spain . he is a kind of bad showman who can make you feel sick ... very embarrassing . nacho had made some commercials in tv , i remember one in which nacho was looking for paul mc carney around madrid ( the commercial was about a mc carney cd collection ) . this little movie is like a nacho's commercial : bad storyline , bad directing , and awful performances . i can't believe that a disgusting movie like this was in the kodak theater . poor oscar ... nacho could made this movie because of his wife , the producer of this 7:35 , a woman very well connected with spanish tv business men .
