1088|0|Crude sports spoof too dumbed-down to be funny.
45149|0|The first chinks in the armour start appearing once you can't even honour your own lore.
80313|0|[The] thematic material is so far beyond [director Joe] Roth's reach, you feel that even offering him a stepladder wouldn't help.
47115|1|Celebrates imagination as the only escape from a bleak, ridiculous, and troubled world.
66725|1|Gandolfini is especially good as the hitman with a heart of gold.
15032|1|The wizardry of Jim Henson's Creature Shop and a superbly over-the-top performance by Angelica Huston gives The Witches a good deal of charm and enjoyment.
38456|1|David Cronenberg's remake of the 1958 horror classic The Fly is not for the squeamish. Casting Jeff Goldblum was a good choice as he brings a quirky, common touch to the spacey scientist role.
44919|1|Even if it isn't much of a comedy, at least it's a good-spirited one. The cast gives it their all, but the material is hopeless.
49300|0|History is scant or purposefully blurred in Lou Ye's abstruse Purple Butterfly, a war drama with Wong-like delusions of love
596|1|Though its plot wins no points for originality, Breaking Away is a thoroughly delightful light comedy.
142|0|Angelina Jolie's romance/comedy/drama isn't terribly romantic, comedic or dramatic.
17137|0|As time-travel pictures go, this Jean-Claude Van Damme vehicle is a passable but disappointing excursion into well-traveled terrain.
40083|1|More sex jokes, cartoon carnage than the TV show.
44722|0|The mystery is never as intriguing as the atmosphere.
74670|1|I can't say I really enjoyed myself watching Hiroshima mon amour. Resnais' style is deliberately off-putting - the thought of entertaining an audience seems repugnant to him - but I respect the film for its audacious storytelling.
31526|1|If you only ever see one bad movie about warrior chicks who meet on a tropical isle for a fight contest, make it DOA: Dead or Alive.
27851|0|... contrary to what the cynical profess, it is possible to cheat an honest man. It's certainly easier to fool the naive and the innocent than your average wised-up consumer of pop culture.
50452|1|A sober action film as viscerally surprising as it is surprisingly affecting.
4298|0|Though the saucy French souffl√© has a few tasty moments it mostly sinks into being tasteless fare.
39553|1|Bresson -- who was eighty-two years old when the film came out, and clearly in no mood for mellowing -- frames the acts of wickedness, both great and small, with a terrifying calm.
46008|1|This is all about Jack Black being Jack Black, funny and well-conceived wrestling action, and catch-you-off-guard comedy. Nacho has all of those things in a headlock.
771|1|A solid thriller with a great cast that tends to suffer from some faults...
13080|1|Paprika stays in your mind as pure freedom and pure exhilaration.
31498|0|All involved could do better. An interesting curiosity only for diehard Milla Jovovich fans.
76435|1|The Promotion may not be much, and you get to know that supermarket uncomfortably well by the end of the 85 minutes. But as I say: He's an interesting writer.
14979|1|Buoyed by strong performances from Perez and Miami-resident Milian, Washington Heights overcomes the familiarity of its premise through its passion and conviction.
13215|0|So-so oater distinguished by Van Peebles' direction, starring.
39852|1|Talky '80s drama has sex, cursing, mature themes.
53931|1|Totally ridiculous (and based on the work of Akira Kurosawa!) but very exciting.
14654|1|Irresistible. It was a bitterly odd pic that offered an Atlantic City scenario that had no saltwater taffy to sweeten the taste.
59134|1|The premise is solid, the script is clever and well-thought-out, and the movie is consistently engaging...
78449|1|Kaufman's enormously entertaining history of America's Mercury astronauts fizzled on release, maybe because it was too smart and cool for its own good.
40854|1|How do you make a movie about the most famous unknown artist in the world?
13901|0|A romance as spectacular as this novel is, it still has a difficult job making the leap to the screen.
69665|0|An almost unbelievably sluggish and uninflected adaptation of Tennessee Williams' searing Orpheus Descending.
17571|1|Excellent performances by everyone involved help you overlook the incongruity of French-speaking actors in traditional English settings.
12873|0|The film is populated with such self-obsessed, distasteful characters, it's hard to care how or why any of them finds happiness.
24460|1|Kwaidan is a psychological horror film for those who are seeking an utterly immersive experience.
59212|0|No comment needed.
26434|1|The lively and soulful music of the klezmer keeps things moving in an upbeat fashion.
20151|1|Equal parts dog adventure and father-son tale.
61732|0|Great monster suit. Not much of a movie
36879|1|One of the most entertaining African-American comedies of manners ever made.
7257|1|Stuck is disturbing in all the right ways, turning an incredible real-life story of human callousness and suffering into a tawdry entertainment that makes guffawing, sociopathic rubbernecks of us all.
29424|1|It plays out as a stylish and lurid amoral vigilante thriller, one that never earns the viewer's confidence that this is the real thing.
25510|1|Another edge-of-your-seat, roller coaster ride from a matinee idol everybody loves to root for.
19381|1|thought-provoking and truthful ...
17757|1|It is well acted, cleverly directed, photographed and edited, but leaves one feeling hollow and feeling after seeing it.
45823|0|Aims for the edge but eccentricity and excess take over and dominate, thus taking the rest of the film down with them.
9490|0|On The Ring 2.
55193|0|Unwatchable.
11576|0|Elite Squad can't decide whether it wants to pull the lid back on what urban decay has wrought or simply open up a can of whup ass.
24118|0|Overlong, overpriced, overwrought sentimental bucket of slop.
77945|1|Parker is very good at conveying Agnes' wobbly mixture of instability and emotional bravery, and Jenkins finds the sad, lonely ache below Theresa's urge to regiment the lives of everyone in the family.
29041|0|There's very little about it that isn't utterly predictable, and naturally all major setbacks are quickly and easily overcome after a minute and a half music montage, before the final happy ending pancake platter is doused in syrupy overkill
49423|1|Manipulative to an almost absurd degree...
71558|0|Man's Favorite Sport?, the film's theme song has it, is girls. It certainly is not originality or comedy.
26997|1|Jason Schafer's writing and Jim Fall's direction invest this with a loopy humor and skewed sensitivity that bring an essential freshness to all the blue-balled agony.
809|1|With her sweet-sad face, Mara Wilson is a perfect Matilda.
23936|0|Much potential for comedy is lost, thanks to a weak script, desultory direction and indifferent performances.
14145|0|Nothing spells dull and saccharine quite like the two dreaded H's--hugs and healing.
17566|1|Exhibits many of the genre's common weaknesses, but the fine acting of Edward Norton, Laura Linney and Richard Gere enables us to forgive them.
17611|1|The mix of tones can be jarring, but it all has an odd charm.
17674|0|She Hate Me isn't subversive, it's insipid.
6698|1|A blitzkrieg of hilarious kung fu craziness.
46501|1|The physical creakiness only adds to the sense of mental dilapidation suffered by the anti-hero.
59828|1|The movie is taut with suspense but culminates in wise resignation as the hero comes to understand he's running from a part of himself.
59417|0|Fights ensue. Van-Damme kicks a lot of ass. Explosions occur. The end.
17026|1|FRWL has character and dash, and even something of a conventional plot, all worth revisiting for this pin-sharp restoration.
72012|1|The result is a slice of delightful escapism that will enchant children and entertain parents as well.
38151|1|Ruthless People contains some of the biggest laughs of 1986.
77763|1|One of the most underrated comedies of the 1990s
37769|1|This sharply scripted study of a bereaved woman who literally wishes her partner back from the grave is an impressive directorial bow by British playwright Anthony Minghella.
603|0|It is not a surprise to learn that Bucatinsky is developing a sitcom based on this film, because it plays like an overly long pilot.
1302|1|If you're a flamenco fan, this works as a concert film. It's as mere movie that its voice is strained.
43026|1|A front-loaded film, sure, but what a front.
70279|1|A stylish if seriously far-fetched nightmare.
10256|1|"The first of these movies remains one of the great sci-fi horror achievements of the modern cinema, but its sequel, ""Aliens,"" is that rare instance where a follow-up deviates from the formula and finds an effective rhythm in propelling the story"
43317|0|Eddie Murphy in slapstick potty humor comedy.
53762|1|Even if The Ex doesn't always work, on some level you have to respect a summer Hollywood comedy that is daring enough to make you want to see the guy in the wheelchair thrown down the stairs.
31424|0|The latest in a long line of mediocre August releases, this would-be thriller boasts several well acted, interesting characters stuck in a story that is unevenly paced and overly familiar.
73492|1|One of the finest-written surprises of the year.
17470|1|An unpretentiously sweet home-is-where-the-heart-is fantasy.
55475|0|For me this film lost most of its relevance on November 3rd 2004.
53422|1|It's very moving, even when it is moving a little slowly.
59410|1|You believe these four are friends now and will probably be friends when they're little old ladies.
3651|1|For me, the pluses far outweighed any misgivings I had with this ultimately very moving film.
12230|1|A raw and unadorned look at child abuse and its idiosyncratic repercussions.
17041|1|It's also a generous performance, because Wood literally takes a backseat to Hutz's movie-stealing turn as the language-mangling Alex, whose English is 'not so premium'.
64103|1|Joyously entertaining, escapist stuff.
68891|1|...[the ending] feels out of place and out of synch with the rest of the movie.
56606|1|With Dreyfuss and Murray on top form, not even the familiar plotline -- uptight rich person meets free-wheeling poor person and learns about life -- can prevent this lunatic comedy from being funny.
60535|0|Marisa's bored and frustrated sexpot trophy wife is pretty much kept around in the movie just for occasional guy sexual satisfaction, in Sid Lumet's human cesspool of murky madness.
8556|1|A star-driven Paul Newman crime mystery drama.
30241|0|Photographed in murky yellows and browns by John Alonzo, this 1979 film is sluggish and vague, trivializing its subject in a wash of unearned sentimentality.
39235|1|One of the best comedies in years...the film never sells out to itself.
51548|0|In short, we have a trainwreck of a comedy that goes on far longer than you'd care to watch an actual trainwreck, trying too hard to be offensive the entire time and delivering its jokes with the timing of a 2-year-old with a mixing spoon and a soup-pot.
7464|1|More than 40 years old, Fran√ßois Truffaut's whirling dervish remains an ageless beauty.
23295|0|The characters, while cute, were not credible enough to be believable nor humorous enough to be funny.
39089|1|Tailor-made for John Wayne.
63305|1|Pasolini uses a complex but seemingly stark and simple visual style, and he evokes wonderful performances from nonprofessionals Enrique Irazoqui, Margherita Caruso, and Marcello Morante.
76749|1|The goo still flew in this fun Disney sequel.
9755|1|Alex Holdridge has written and directed a sweet, funny little indie movie.
16528|0|Depp trudges through gamely, but I sensed that he knew how silly the whole movie was, and didn't really commit to it.
11961|1|Bluth and his animators, bless them, chose to revive an endangered art form -- classically detailed animation. They drew their characters exquisitely and gave them individual personalities.
7789|1|A sort of minimalist telepic precursor to John Dahl's Joyride that packs the unadulterated genre punch of pure grain alcohol...
20584|0|[Adam] Rapp's screenplay doesn't have much sympathy for its characters.
19520|0|Winner's recourse to caricature when dealing with police and thugs, and his virtually overt sympathies with the confused, violent Bronson, make for uncritical, simplistic viewing.
6193|0|Provides some amazing encounters, bravura acting turns and gruesome carnage. But it doesn't add up to enough.
23740|0|The auteur's unbeatable weirdness here mutates into preciosity.
15667|0|Will have a short shelf life, and just as reality TV offers instant-gratification entertainment, The Contenders offers instant-gratification satire.
28725|0|The trail leads to a series of amorous dames, murder-minded plug-uglies and dangerous adventures that offer excitement but have little clarity to let the viewer know what's going on.
9566|1|Road Trip is the best dumb party movie of the year; if that's what you've been craving, buckle up.
63369|1|An unforgettable harrowing examination of the lives of the Afghan people.
58161|0|In the dire The Master of Disguise, Carvey is seen to maximum disadvantage as a dim-witted Italian-American waiter whose family have an inherited gift for turning themselves into anyone from Bo Derek to George Bush.
13404|0|An improvement on the feeble examples of big-screen Poke-mania that have preceded it.
10635|1|Delightful in the affection it shows for its characters.
2128|1|It bears as little relation to the real Nashville as Altman's 1975 feature, but director Peter Bogdanovich, the talented cast, and the credited and uncredited screenwriters are so busy conjuring up a charming world of their own that I didn't mind.
7302|1|Uneven drama that's too intense for kids.
18497|1|Sure, it's a rush - but is that enough?
74735|1|When it comes time to take this drama to another level, addressing the darker and more pertinent issue of why Guy puts up with it and what he wants out of life, Huang is right there.
55645|1|It's a very intimate, personal drama for three women whose lives are entwined in unexpected ways, and a true pleasure.
22786|1|The storytelling is economical and brisk. In some ways, Waters approaches it more as a pre-teen horror movie.
18823|1|Soapy and trashy, and more than a little bit ludicrous. But there's quite a bit of subtext if you need it.
50463|0|There's almost enough in-joke ingenuity to justify the total absence of plot.
23751|0|Besson manipulates his audience's emotions instead of informing, inspiring, or illuminating its intellect.
19758|1|The flaws don't cripple what is a fiercely funny, exciting and provocative detective story about the crimes of corporate culture -- crimes that transcend race and geography.
38181|0|Visually opaque and narratively enigmatic.
79184|1|Walter Pidgeon stars as the sub commander, a pre-I Dream of Jeannie Barbara Eden plays his secretary, and Peter Lorre amuses as a brilliant scientist.
50520|1|Sergei Eisenstein's classic tale of 13th-century Russia is as magnificent today as it must have been in 1938.
81148|0|If you can believe in Sinatra as an 1810 vintage Spanish guerrilla, you can believe anything, but it's still a slog through a platitudinous script.
6542|1|North Dallas Forty reveals some of the reasons why the fun has been taken out of football.
41820|1|Miike has a knack for tapping into deep-seated cultural anxieties-- particularly male sexual anxiety--that few filmmakers can match.
39218|0|This disappointing reunion of Grease stars Travolta and Newton-John is lame and forgettable fluff.
8056|1|"Has there ever been a more perfect role for Keanu Reeves than floppy-haired, dim-brained high school slacker Ted ""Theodore"" Logan?"
56071|1|Doesn't represent much movement from where Smith had placed himself with Clerks II, which means what you felt about the previous should be about the same as what you'd feel about the latest.
77683|1|It's a sin to miss 'The Apostle.'
41508|1|It is, in a sense, like a high school reunion, taking people we last saw in 1951 and continuing their histories in the early 1980s.
66193|1|A searing, structurally ingenious look at racial tension on the streets of Paris.
14448|1|The lasting power of the [film]... rests in the emotional connection to the characters .
1462|1|More magical than the original!
54190|1|Above average drama that put Robin Williams on dramatic actor map.
6458|0|An overly sentimental 'family film' that brings to mind the old Disney True-Life Adventures, Cheetah is a very old-fashioned movie. And that's not meant as a compliment.
29913|1|The real Mars may be nothing like it appears in this movie, but it sure does make you want to visit anyway.
30921|0|Unfortunately -- like its lead character -- the film doesn't do much more than drift from one scene to another.
13249|0|Pretty warmed-over stuff, this future world of the terminal TV game shows, and director Glaser fails to muster much pace and punch.
56361|1|Clive Barker's deliciously warped imagination is on full display in this modern classic of horror.
26599|0|There is no shortage of ham-fisted metaphors, no paucity of windy speeches, no lack of moments that tug at the heart like a newborn clumsily grabbing for its mother.
2266|1|Better than average teen romantic comedy from the Hughes years.
5411|1|While not quite the caliber of The French Connection or To Live and Die in LA, Friedkin's latest effort will find its niche among followers who prefer a smaller story to the epic scope of most thrillers.
34831|0|The Siege attempts to update the bluffs and counterfeints of the Cold War spy thriller, not to advance any ideological point but to obscure the fact that it doesn't have one.
34037|1|A sly, slick comment on the anxieties of sex and status, not to mention the true perils of the service industry.
29595|0|Its potential as a spicy spoof of Hollywood's incestuous relation with the entertainment press has been Ephroned away in favor of bland romantic comedy.
80839|0|...deeply unsatisfying in so many ways...
12035|1|Across the Universe doesn't completely work, but when it does, you're in for one wild and wonderful ride.
61442|0|I find it hard to believe that many people will pay $6 or $7 to see a picture that has TV sitcom production values, writing, and acting.
6492|1|The best of the many Die Hard rip-offs made during the 1990s. Sudden Death is a thrilling rollercoaster ride of hard-edged action.
1947|0|Much maligned for various reasons, this Cleopatra may be the most expensive movie ever made, but certainly not the worst, just a verbose, muddled affair that is not even entertaining as a star vehicle for Taylor and Burton.
1583|1|A nice tale of vengeance with some primo acting.
44262|1|Lets the music do the talking and that's great as far as I'm concerned: I love Young's sound.
33805|1|This is a powerful and profound Japanese film about one woman's long and arduous journey through grief's labyrinth.
69992|1|Screenwriters Hurlbut & Balderston and Director James Whale have given it the macabre intensity proper to all good horror pieces, but have substituted a queer kind of mechanistic pathos for the sheer evil that was Frankenstein.
1204|0|Martin Lawrence's long, sad devolution from the poor man's young Eddie Murphy to the poor man's late-period Eddie Murphy continues.
81069|1|The true strength of this thriller is how the duet plays out. The true shock is how casually perverse the underlying message becomes.
2610|1|The writing-directing pair of Neil Hunter and Tom Hunsinger create a fairly seamless patchwork, although the novelty starts to wear thin by the third layer.
1427|1|The ultimate conclusion of the film will leave you thoughtful and even perhaps a touch sad -- rare for any film, and even more rare for a thriller.
527|1|The two leads play to their strengths.
927|0|This isn't one of [Keaton's] best, despite some amusing scenes.
3915|1|Diva, as a lifestyle, a fantasy, a model for alienation and solipsism and eccentricity, has gone deep into all of us.
61029|1|Mongol, from its thrilling battles to its intimate romance, has the look, scale, story and feel of an old-fashioned epic in the best and biggest sense of the word.
58643|0|I guess it was a pretty good movie, though I got a little bored halfway through and took a little snooze. I like air conditioning. There was lots of popcorn on the floor.
10011|1|While the main lure for audiences--Will Ferrell--is basically forgettable, Allen does compose one fascinating and witty look at the human mind and its own ability to depict events through our own sub-conscious preference.
19284|0|Catwoman's director, a visual-effects specialist named Pitof, is not contained by the rules of filmmaking. Scenes that make sense? Nonsense. Characters with inner lives? Utterly passe.
29116|1|the opening 15 minutes was absolutely gut-wretchingly hysterical. I laughed more at this second film than I did at the first one...
18026|1|Awesome mystery. The afterlife subplot works perfectly and sells the surprise twist.
70166|0|Hard to watch, hard to listen to and hard to follow.
44127|0|The ingredients all seem to be there for a rich, emotionally engrossing movie experience, but the storytelling flair and directorial touch are not.
26190|1|Gangsters and Lesbos and pre-Matrix Wachowskis . . . oh my!
23078|0|I grew up with Mr. Magoo. I watched Mr. Magoo. I loved Mr. Magoo. Leslie Nielsen, you're no Mr. Magoo.
6196|1|It's crude and rude but there's something endearingly innocent about Kevin Smith's aptly titled comedy in which a dabble in porn becomes a mother of a funny set up
15812|1|A fresh and immensely entertaining take on the zombie genre
5769|1|Lee provides no such easy comfort, instead keeping audiences constantly off-kilter, purposefully frustrating them with character behavior that's just...wrong.
2722|1|...A gripping, fast-moving film that will be added to the short list of quality movies focused on the U.S. conflict in Vietnam.
47251|0|Monster House may look like the sort of movie that is more or less safe for little kids, but the humour gets a little crude in places.
7734|0|God, this thing is a total piece of junk. Even I'm embarrassed for You, and I'm an atheist.
279|1|On its simplified terms of one man against the machine, the movie works, thanks almost entirely to Greg Kinnear's performance.
61933|0|A strong cast... makes this picture look attractive, but it's hard to find what else might be appealing about this story of a prostitute and suburban widower.
68612|1|There was something missing from this ironical musical and it wasn't from the star performers.
422|1|Well-acted drama full of Clinton-era jabs.
11499|0|It's a horrendously long, poorly acted, unoriginal piece of crap that made me sad to be a Japanese-American.
77095|0|An over-long mish-mash of scarcely linked sub-plots...
62443|1|The biggest screen orgasm of the year.
352|1|Mindlessly enjoyable escapist fare in which a courtroom drama is enlivened by intercutting it with a couple of wholly improbable but spectacular chases in--and above--New York.
65791|1|Terrific turns by all make this a tense, if slightly predictable, treat for terror fans.
28670|1|The acting is good and airy, like the setting, in this much more than promising first film.
34448|1|Dozens of other movies have romped on the same grass. But Gervais spritzes everything in Ghost Town with a delightfully refreshing comic mist.
10951|1|An appallingly handsome and creepy film entirely suiting the subject matter and repellent and alluring in equal measure. If you relish dishy tales of the depraved rich, it's like Thanksgiving in a movie.
6110|1|Sit back, watch a master at work, and never once believe that you're not observing the real C.S. Lewis.
25876|0|A skeleton of theme minus the meat of resonance
51781|0|For a filmmaker who wants to create an adaptation of the story of Jesus, Mel Gibson's motives seem ironically impure.
40363|0|A compendium of the worst cliches of Japanese animation -- two hours of chases, laser attacks, machine-gun battles, spilled stage blood, computer-animated backgrounds and hokey dialogue.
68336|1|This is a must-see documentary for any film lover.
18031|1|"Inspired by the real story of classical pianist David Helfgott, ""Shine"" re-creates that emotionally piercing story, note by memorable note."
40167|0|...would be a total loss if not for two supporting performances taking place at the movie's edges.
13416|1|The wit with which Burman casts an almost Shakespearean longing for purpose and direction against the tiny confines of a seedy mall is adroit and inspired.
711|1|The Fisher King has two actors at the top of their form, and a compelling, well-directed and well-produced story.
4022|1|The film that made the monocle wearing von Stroheim famous as The Man You Love To Hate.
9231|1|Golden Door belongs to(Vincenzo) Amato (Respiro). He makes this tale of woe and wonderment the charmer it turns out to be.
1512|0|[A] trashy, overwrought thriller.
12223|0|Intriguing but finally dissatisfying.
62058|0|Under Henry King's direction there is little of the old Fox pep.
46683|0|A lugubrious imitation of a second-rate television movie, over-produced and over-cast.
39624|1|It's a truly great film.
3003|1|Peter Weir's film is so cleverly conceived and brilliantly executed that it almost seems like a fresh thought. And even if it doesn't, it nevertheless forms the basis of a very witty exercise.
24220|1|It's not necessary to share this documentary's taste for head-banging music, which it indulges with an exuberant array of concert clips, to appreciate its bemused, articulate interviewees and its larger wit.
68012|0|Paparazzi is Hollywood's egomaniacal warning to moviegoers: Love us, just don't come near us.
1003|1|De Jarnatt does a superb job of cultivating a vibe of bleak, apocalyptic hopelessness...
16125|1|The screenplay, from a novel by John D. Voelker, drips with the smoke-drenched taste of 1940s noir, stinging the eyes and lungs.
25824|1|Hurt and Davis at their peaks in a touching, well-crafted drama
77949|1|The genius of the film is that you never feel you're being preached at, but rather being allowed a fly-on-the-wall view of a systematic crushing of humanity.
6551|1|It can't help but remind us that the man Nader prevented from becoming president has since been more instrumental in the war on environmental pollution than any other public figure. Irony abounds.
51762|1|Laura is still every bit as gripping in 2012.
7520|1|An outrageous, assured debut from a talented new director.
5344|1|A smart and very funny action comedy that will really knock your socks off.
3321|1|Always intriguing but not always fully involving, CJ7 still features, as with its resurrecting dog, Chow's enlivening touch. Even when his film isn't completely absorbing, it seems he never met a dying genre clich√© he can't reanimate.
54277|1|Decades later, Queen Christina remains one of Garbo's most poignant, touching, and enjoyable films, showing the Divine in all her glory.
17225|0|There is little new in this mostly dry and humorless defense of President Bush, which adds a little heat but not a whole lot of light to the political debate.
53946|0|The fiction element of the film, instead of driving Levin to deeper truths, delivers him toward triteness and manipulation.
21524|0|Rambo but with pretensions.

11792|1|For all its oddities and deliberate controversy, Padre Amaro is at bottom a very melodramatic soap opera. It's not a bad one, but it's pretty much 99 and 44/100ths pure.
72569|0|Korine's most lavishly produced pic to date begins as a sweet-tempered tale of social misfits-turned-celebrity impersonators, but falls short of its ambition to say something meaningful about the obsessive nature of celebrity culture.

59224|1|Few outside of Coen cliques paid this nihilistic neo-noir much attention. Perhaps that's its wryest, slyest punchline: To watch Ed Crane is to largely forget him and, upon returning to him, revisit the pleasure of meeting him for the first time.

39325|1|An excellent contribution to Ghibli's legacy of pro-environment fables about the magic of the natural world and the emptiness of crowded cities.
27396|1|It's not necessarily a fun or loveable picture, but it is interesting and entertaining.
54399|0|Landau does the best he can with his limitations.
59281|1|The mere spectacle of Elwood and Jake in their shades isn't quite as giggle-inducing as it presumably was back in 1980, but the stunts are still awe-inspiring, and there's plenty of laughs. They really were thinking big.
7169|1|He does, but you probably won't, especially from watching this movie.
66550|0|Interesting now only as a better-forgotten relic of a time in which people actually paid full-ticket price to see Martin Short in a movie.
20044|1|A lark for everybody concerned, including the audience.
39670|0|The solitary Ghost Dog remains too remote a figure to sustain much interest, and certain elements of the film do not fit well together.
5231|0|Shadow feels like a missed opportunity.
775|0|Good comedy is derived from the characters, but this film doesn't establish its characters well enough to be effective on that level.
70979|0|John Carpenter's return to horror fizzles.
50518|1|Claire Trevor won a Supporting Oscar for playing the alcoholic mistress of Edward G. Robinson's gangster in John Huston's taut crimer starring Bogart.
9321|1|It is quickly paced, completely entertaining, and its philosophical pretensions don't get in the way.
61592|1|We come away from the documentary with a profound admiration for Coppola, if only because he didn't kill himself or someone else.
43897|0|...the more the body count mounts, the more cartoonish the movie seems, and the less we care.
14674|1|Much-maligned comedy which, three decades after its disastrous debut, seems to be have been way ahead of its time.
21964|0|everybody should be ashamed
11532|1|A little overwhelming on your senses, but it's uncannily engrossing.
69900|1|Mystery-thriller buffs, promise yourselves that you'll see The Pledge. And while you're at it, be sure to invite along Jack Nicholson fans and anyone who saw the first two movies that Sean Penn directed.
69287|1|Forget what you've heard - this is something special
18245|0|Director Russell Mulcahy is revered by genre fans for his work on the original Highlander, but he won't gain many followers outside Fangoria circles with this over-the-top splatter fest.
55537|1|Much of the credit must go to Jessica Walter for her outstanding performance which somehow manages to be chilling while at the same time sympathetic.
50067|1|Henderson's warm and toasty little gem of a film, slight though it may be, reminds you that the Greatest Generation, full of vim, vigor, and -- most important -- an indefatigable sense of purpose, grew up on both sides of the Big Pond.
14240|1|An absorbing thriller, one that works its narrative complications over a genuinely moving emotional foundation and is spiked with just enough dark humor to keep it from becoming overly serious.
47091|0|Lacks the classic Disney charm that works for adults as well as kids
67284|1|Starring Bette Davis, Lillian Hellman's anti-Nazi play was made into simplistic film, full of contrivances and propagandistic speeches, meant to justify U.S. involvement in WWII.
10314|1|Despite the somewhat meandering nature of its plot, the film's underlying messages about social hypocrisy on all levels still has a strong bite to it, and it remains one of the more creative and daring forays in feature-length animation.
26839|1|Jean-Jacques Beniex's bold experiment is worth a place of importance in cinematic history.
1515|0|From a filmmaking angle, it's a movie to be studied, but from a writing angle, it could have been so much better.
71425|1|A woman at the end of her rope after she is deserted by her husband finds a path of the heart that enables her to share her gift with the world.
29118|1|the movie is little more than an interracial riff on Meet the Parents, but it's consistently funny, and it's enough of a riff to make it feel fresh.
14790|1|Woody Allen's latest is an ambling, broad comedy about all there is to love -- and hate -- about the movie biz.
74172|1|It's hard to imagine another actress pulling this off without appearing sleazy.
10861|0|We all know New Jack City is making the right statement on drugs, racism, the system, etc. But the fact is it's not very good.
62614|1|Bracing in its frank depiction of gay sex life, both promiscuous and committed.
30844|1|...the action is richly detailed and thrillingly staged.
22207|1|Even with a well-known story as its backdrop, it is only upon the third or fourth viewing that one can even begin to contemplate the larger questions at work in the film.
3678|0|I got a headache watching this meaningless downer.
17153|1|Watching Tully reminded me of a time when calling a movie 'little' was a compliment, a way of saying a director had found ways to locate his movie in a world that seemed entirely real.
31124|1|Wry, cold and confident, Willis squints and blasts his way through the film, a blazing pistol in each hand.
6476|1|A lively if overlong movie that allows for the full spectrum of human emotion and behavior.
80958|0|This pathetic, previously released cine-road kill was obviously only exhumed to cash in on some now-famous cast members.
61790|1|A pretty much ideal big-screen adaptation of the material, which becomes convincingly cinematic. [Blu-ray]
9492|1|A remarkably elusive picture, a producer-auteur's personal summarization, a gold mine for later fabulists
12600|1|Unsatisfied with just being cute, this sucker wound up being both fun and clever.
1628|0|It is proof that exotic locations, girls, one-liners and a couple of car chases don't necessarily add up to a decent Bond film.
37865|0|Sadly, most of the time Distant Voices is a hit parade of Father's swiftest punches played to the hit parade that he might have been listening to on the radio.
26388|1|If you need a quick cartoon high, and a few cheap laughs, before the real summer movies begin, Viva Rock Vegas is your temporary fix.
81004|0|A chokehold of a movie, grabbing us but not ultimately engaging us.
12032|0|A hoot to see Matt and Renee, but none of the thrills of the original. Not scary or fun.
1603|1|A modest film that is surprisingly effective in its directness and fascinating for its complex portrayals of marital distress in action.
1362|1|Pretty good romantic soap...except for Streisand's talons.
16420|1|"As much as it is about a deeply troubled individual, ""Dog Day Afternoon"" is about a shift toward exploitation in the American media via live television."
63522|0|Eddie and the Cruisers is vivid, full of conviction and more than a little foolish at times.
81031|0|How about a bumper sandwich boogerlips!
36473|0|Baye is left stranded, a performance too strong for a film this slight to contain.
69416|0|With a plot that can be roughly described as Serpico for people who never outgrew The A-Team, Seagal beats and bangs up Detroit single-handedly.
7185|0|Only Woody Allen seems to have understood what is possible in a featurette.
45844|0|Steven Seagal is funnier by accident than most comedians are on purpose.
56891|1|In the interest of understanding how your government and big business work (and work together against the consumer's interest), you owe it to yourself to see this film.
64698|1|Mike Myers' first claim to fame. Funny.
57928|0|squarely aimed at the type of audience willing to overlook all sorts of inconsistencies and stereotypes in a movie as long as it includes a few juicy toilet jokes.
61140|1|Federico Fellini's films beg to be seen on a movie screen. Their panoramic, overstuffed frames and larger-than-life characters overflow the boundaries of home theater; their exuberant, generous humor is best enjoyed in a packed auditorium.
52782|0|"Has its articulate moments but for the most part Rob Zombie's grisly, nasty ""'Devils Rejects"" is mostly just grisly (and nasty)."
60510|1|Atmospheric, unusual Tyrone Power vehicle--no less different for director John Ford.
47605|1|A mess, yes, but a funny and highly enjoyable one.
42366|1|"In some ways an even more brilliant contraption than ""The Third Man,"" and with a third act that might be superior, too."
19408|0|It's not clear why Steven Spielberg's Amblin decided to make a live-action entertainment starring the least interesting and most saccharine of all 50s cartoon characters.
38857|1|While You Were Sleeping may not be a film for the ages. It likely won't even rank among the presummer season's biggest hits. But it is worth noting, for it may mark the birth of a star.
38593|1|Mullan makes the journey more than worthwhile, but don't go in expecting profundity.
14215|1|Though the film is crowd-pleasing enjoyable, it never fully brings in enough light to its underground setting to completely satisfy as a fully realized work.
55551|1|Like many, I have loved this thriller of conscience and betrayal most of my moviegoing life.
141|0|The animation is competent, and some of the gags are quite funny, but Jonah ... never shakes the oppressive, morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment.
8257|1|A well-crafted look at the hard childhood of Irish author Frank McCourt and his family.
62464|1|"They should've released this to theatres instead of ""Batman and Robin"""
71717|0|There's barely a belly laugh here, and judging from the deafening silence in the theatre where I saw the film, it's not just me.
59332|0|"Rock is a man who continues to perpetuate stereotypes for the price of ""comedy"" and continues making one terrible film after the other."
4563|1|A brave, convention-challenging sex farce about the ties that bind us in love.
12158|0|Kim Cattrall's encounter with a young delivery man is almost alone worth the price of admission.
55413|1|For its length, it would have been nice to learn a little bit more about some of the children. Nonetheless, Mad Hot Ballroom is still an uplifting and inspiring tale.
68479|1|Very good biopic about the early days of the Beatles
48503|0|It's a film that's more likely to leave you confused and angry than frightened or inspired that something positive is happening in the horror genre.
68478|0|Even if cast differently, this would be a weird film.
65005|1|Screw Tara Reid! Who needs her in this movie. We've got a cockney girl with huge knockers.
54780|0|A surprisingly tame psychological thriller with few genuine surprises.
79918|0|It's become abundantly clear that series star/writer/producer Ice Cube hasn't a clue as to why the first Friday became such a beloved cult classic in the first place.
22722|0|There's scarcely a single moment in it that seems to be spontaneous.
63145|0|Basically a B, it has been elevated in form -- but not in substance -- via four bigger names, location shooting and more production values. Sometimes the trick works, but not here.
24819|0|I am afraid Mr. Lester has not added a single discouragement of war, but simply a little discouragement toward patronizing too-pretentious films.
73651|0|Harrison Ford is still trying to crack the comedy code, God love him.
46069|0|Shamateurishly directed, this Roberts vehicle traversing the clich√©d class-clash/love story territory of Pretty Woman is a dog.
15247|0|Watching this, you may be reminded of what Gertrude Stein once observed about the benighted state of Cal-ee-fornia, 'there is no there there.'
75383|1|Works because they set out to make a faithful genre picture just as equally as a comedy. The film is even funnier because they never sacrifice plot or character for a laugh.
41002|1|One of the most underrated films of the '90s
2455|1|It manages to be a watchable, even enjoyable movie about and for girls, and in our world of candy-coated sparkly pink crap, that's a rare and commendable thing.
18662|0|It does not have the right stuff. Indeed, it is pretty silly stuff.
31241|1|Seemingly interminable documentary with some good moments.
1493|1|The camerawork is instinctively fluid, the performances savage - this is one of the best films about theatre ever made.
71956|1|Like Jules and Jim or Band of Outsiders blended with A Hard Day's Night.
13343|0|A daft, disappointing comedy.
1604|0|Lame sequel, but what did you expect?
81301|1|For God's sake, make sure you have the director's cut. The theatrical cut was an abomination.
33210|1|George Romero contributes the screenplay this time, basing it on some tastefully selected Stephen King morsels.
9671|0|Webster's Dictionary defines the word bad as: 'the opposite of good.' After seeing the film -- I am sure Webster will add Double Take to its definition.
49510|1|Of course, Superman saves the world, but the real news is that there's still some life in the series.
11919|1|Christopher Reeve essays the title role and makes it his own, combining correctly chiseled features with a likable comic humanity, while the film itself nicely balances special effects with the romance of Superman and Lois Lane.
73940|0|The movie is a good cautionary example of what happens when its maker is too close to the material, who can't see the forest for the trees, the story for the ape.
60964|0|Possibly the most irresponsible movie ever made and also one of the worst.
41019|0|The film just revels in gay jokes and marriage clich√©s. There's no actual awkwardness to Tom doing a traditionally female job, so they just call him gay over and over and over.
64902|0|This is a hackneyed, sprawling mess of a comedy, rarely funny and never interesting.
37149|1|[Its] problems cannot be ignored.
78293|1|It's only as good as its cast. Fortunately, it's a good cast.
46647|0|85 minutes doesn't provide an adequate format for developing seven distinct characters.
75317|1|Mature and heartfelt, though not overly saccharine.
79867|0|Rambling and confused, the film shows much concern for plot and not enough for characterization, particularly in second half which unfolds as a catalog of events. Misdirected, the usually reliable Depp gives a confused and scattered performance.
24078|1|"This is the ""Reservoir Dogs"" with a twist of ""Near Dark"" set to the tune of ""Assault on Precinct 13."""
3135|1|It's an entertaining pastiche, a slice of movie history that's both fun and educational (if slightly myopic about what has come since).
16588|0|As forgettable as a Hollywood couple's marriage vows.
27512|0|Playful but inconsequential...the interpretation of Dick's intriguing concept is a street which mostly just dead-ends into noisy silliness. [Blu-ray]
63904|0|A tedious, vastly disappointing film that does not do justice to the wonderful and touching book upon which it is based.
33772|0|The potency of the Disney brand name will be tested with Atlantis, a peculiar animated feature that has no children in its story, no cute creatures, and no musical or dance numbers. Any reason for the family to go?
1928|1|A surprisingly enjoyable film that its young target audience will love, while their parents will find it quite tolerable indeed.
9989|1|It's easier to take this movieish virus thriller once you accept Dustin Hoffman as a legit action hero.
51154|1|Predictable but pleasant movie for teens and up.
20474|1|It has a magnificence that creeps out a little at a time, especially over repeated viewings.
80963|0|Critics at the time loved this rather sanctimonious jaunt through history. Seen from the vantage point of post-Second World War egalitarianism, however, it all appears quaint and riddled with accepted class differences.
27954|1|An empowering film for children, showing them at their most capable, working through problems and finding innovative solutions to overcome what seems like an insurmountable obstacle.
36764|1|Needless to say a must-see for Wongcolytes, Days of Being Wild is also an excellent entry point for people who haven't yet caught this most exotic and habit-forming of cinematic bugs.
11907|1|Taken together, the women tell a universal story about the beauty and battles of daily life.
55544|1|Good Morning, Vietnam proved that Robin Williams could act and be hilariously funny in the same film.
65076|0|An empty vessel... bloated beyond all recognition, and [evidencing] absolutely no flow or consistency -- there's nary a human heartbeat here in its two-and-a-half-hour-plus running time.
80742|0|Boasting a prettified brutality that rivals that of 300, Pathfinder also explores a similar theme, the manly pursuit of revenge at any cost.
27787|1|Atkinson's genius at portraying a pesky, childish adult is reminiscent of the great comic stars of silent movies, Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin.
69742|1|Antonioni seems to be using his absence from the scene as an opportunity to restate his vision, perhaps having a new generation of filmgoers in mind.
34296|0|A movie just shouldn't feel like homework. And with the constant shift in stories and repeatedly reinvented characters, unless you're in the mood for taking notes, you're going to feel like you're invited to rehearsals, rather than the finished product.
17301|0|Forgettable Hollywood war movie that begs you to leave your brain at home...
16930|1|It's gorgeous to look at, with its reverse zooms that slowly widen to stunning rural panoramas, its beautiful framing, its delight in decorative detail. You feel you are watching a masterclass in how to recreate the look and feel of the late 18th century.
44884|1|In many ways The Fugitive represents the pinnacle of a genre not much in style any more: the suspense/action picture.
17250|1|I am more offended by his lack of faith in his audience than by anything on display here.
16051|1|How can anyone not like the combo of Woody and Bogie in one movie?
42827|0|It was a good idea having subtitles, because the heavy Scottish accents are very difficult to understand.
26041|0|It might have been fun, but [director Bob] Dolman focuses on all the wrong things.
61551|1|[A] slick, overproduced movie, as addictive as reality tv despite the fact that there isn't a shred of reality to be found anywhere.
79676|0|"""The Arrival"" is a good 20 minutes too long and heavy with useless scenes in which we learn far too much about Sheen's relationship with his girlfriend."
8051|0|There's nothing wrong with this movie, it just kind of moves along at this little pace, no surprises.
33133|1|'Niki Caro's striking visual images match her elegant, understated prose creating an uplifting story.'
40506|1|Mr. Murphy chews the scenery every chance he gets and it recalls what made him such a star in the first place.
36079|1|It's a curious mix: at times deliriously hammy, at others melancholy, contemplative and oddly beautiful.
45263|1|Gory European gothic horror doesn't come any grittier and weirder than it does when a couple of would-be lesbian college girlfriends retreat to a weekend at the secluded farmhouse of one of their parents to study for their final exams.
23451|1|Affliction is a shattering film, a dose of bracing naturalism based on Russell Banks' most lacerating novel.
8909|1|[Flynn] catapults across the screen with the greatest of ease, exuding so much charm and confidence that he seems to klieg-light the film all by himself.
75961|1|Welcome back, big guy.
79058|1|Visually lyrical film romance also has problems with dubious views on teen sexuality.
33584|1|A modest thriller in comparison to Hitchcock's later works, but one that's nonetheless taut and cleverly managed.
5932|1|Comedy at its best.
13273|1|Sharp, daring, revealing and often splutteringly funny.
30161|1|Lee sustains the bubbling hilarity, but also provides quieter, deeper observation of the characters' motives and moods.
987|0|When monsters attack, the camera gets all jerky, creating the horror effect known as motion sickness.
12727|1|Huston nails both the glad-handing and the choking sense of hollow despair.
61399|1|The acting is uniformly compelling.
25799|0|This baffling, unintentionally sidesplitting horror show has opened just in time to qualify as the worst film of the year.
18913|1|An inspiring documentary about a charismatic and determined young man who almost single-handedly has changed the way the disabled are treated in Ghana, Africa.
6682|1|Night Moves is a paradox: a suspenseless suspenser, very well cast with players who lend sustained interest to largely synthetic theatrical characters.
18142|1|Pedro Almodovar has done something nearly unheard of: he has made a wheelchair movie without maudlin sentiment and overbearing importance. Even better, it's actually rather enjoyable.
55186|0|The humour is genial and both Affleck and Bullock are easy on the eye, but the film itself ends up being little more than a storm in a teacup.
68265|1|Has the galvanic pulse of a filmmaker trying things out, failing, and trying again
32657|0|A well-intentioned study of high-school kids coping (and not coping) with the pressures of adolescence, its naturalistic style only makes the more overt dramatic elements look forced and clich√©d.
60652|0|There's nothing particularly memorable here -- no profound triumphs or lasting rallying cries.
15777|0|Nothing in this ambitious, effects-laden spectacle about family values in hell made me laugh. Not once.
41835|1|While it is still plagued by many of the same problems of the first film, Underworld: Evolution is generally an improvement over the original and an entertaining diversion.
73529|1|It is more Sin City (the graphic novel) than Sin City (the movie)! Or at least on a purely visual level . . .
69345|1|Watching director Paul Greengrass's explosive Bloody Sunday, you have to remind yourself at moments that you're not looking at a documentary.
30126|0|You almost want this couple to divorce.
68335|0|It gives us two movie kids in a story so unlikely I assume it was intended as a fantasy. And it gives us dialog and situations so relentlessly cute we want to squirm.
11304|1|Some funny bits, but not essential C&C.
27154|1|Story sings whenever Williams is onscreen. Screen belongs just as often to Leonard, who as Neil has a quality of darting confidence mixed with hesitancy. Hawke, as the painfully shy Todd, gives a haunting performance.
75151|1|First seen soaking in a tub while chomping on a cigar, Robinson arises from the water to put a stranglehold on the film.
10286|1|A passable action-revenge film.
3918|0|Bay has simply botched the job. His action sequences, especially those on the asteroid, are impenetrable and chaotic. And the narrative, larded with the usual military double-cross, is preposterous.
13064|1|Plot intricacies are deftly interwoven, with director Fritz Lang doing a topflight job of balancing the ingredients without dragging the pace.
32993|0|This low-key comedy has some charming elements but struggles to weave them into anything significant.
66551|1|It is not only in actual cinematic effects that Mr. Leni's work is telling; there are sequences in the story which reveal his absolute command of the players.
26126|0|Badly hobbled by an over-emphasis upon cinematic technique that obliterates the emotional undertow of the story.
27758|1|This seemingly incongruous mixture will work for some viewers, and, though the seriousness of Lester's intent may not be appreciated by everyone, most should at least find something here to make them laugh.
13051|0|Electric Cannes opener.
1312|0|Cuar√≥n and company end up throwing all the style they've got at the film... to compensate for a perpetually stalled drama.
16534|1|Marnie's Mama's house is a masterpiece of repressed emotion, a bland domestic space of seemingly placid creams and yellow, rendered in swirling wallpaper and upholstery patterns.
49334|0|this is one film viewers might want to put off until some time long, long after the day after tomorrow.
42721|0|Silly. Simple. Eddie was better than this.
9796|1|Accompanying the exhilarating dancing is a fine set of songs, sung with panache, that are memorable for days afterwards.
7630|1|Of the two stars, Vaughn definitely gets the funnier lines, reducing Wilson almost to the role of straight man. Isla Fisher though, manages to steal every scene that she's in, away from both of them.

3433|0|Formula 51 has dulled your senses faster and deeper than any recreational drug on the market.
18191|1|Major thread of gaiety runs through the proceedings, and McCarey has liberally sprinkled sparkling individual episodes along the way for cinch audience reaction.
4430|1|A vibrant and vivid documentary masterwork.
43264|1|However artless its presentation, Stalags imparts material that's difficult to shake off and impossible to dismiss.
48537|1|Hardcore is a mess, but it's a fascinating mess, and it's held together by a galvanizing performance from George C. Scott, an actor so perpetually intense that one feels he might bust a blood vessel or 12 right up there on the screen.
45304|0|Even Cusack fans will find his charms in short supply here.
11654|0|Watching the film is an experience more akin to being trapped in a dying relationship: lifeless, painful and unbearably dull.
23499|1|It's actually a tense, intelligent film, highlighting two of Friedkin's pet themes, and it deserves consideration among his best films.
30151|1|a gaudy, silly, but undeniably innovative merging of Gaston Leroux's Phantom of the Opera and the Faust legend into a giddy art-rock opera

72339|1|Director Darren Aronofsky creates an eerie Eraserhead-like world that keeps the film compelling.
16006|0|Everything here is beyond predictable.
8184|1|It's still a very harrowing and action packed horror film...
7812|1|We're all ghosts in Tsai's world, though we may not all know it.
28115|0|Scriptwriter Shane Salerno's dialogue is unspeakable, the visceral horror all too familiar, and the ideas distinctly second-hand.
6945|1|Movies such as this work like meditation or music, to nudge us toward the important.
3063|1|As the twists come thick and fast and the plot gets progressively more and more baroque, Branagh shows himself to be at least as intelligent as Brian De Palma in delivering over-the-top stylistic filigree.
21387|0|The new film takes a heavy approach to plain foolishness and doesn't exactly gain loft from the presence of O'Donnell in the centerpiece role. His range is limited to several shades of bland.
6978|1|Kevin Spacey gives the performance of his life.
72167|1|It is a movie that will captivate children, yes, but it will also capture the hearts of the grown-ups, too.

48011|1|A fitting introduction to the very personal cinema of this master craftsman, not only because it exhibits Bergman's signature themes and stylistic devices, but also because it is one of his most life-affirming films.
13092|1|[In the] surprisingly engrossing 'Street Kings,' we are presented with cops who live up to our worst nightmare of excessive force.
591|1|...whether we're supposed to take it as a dark comedy or a straightforward melodrama is up to the viewer. A little of both, maybe. The Coens have always been a little twisted.
49123|1|This full-length animated movie was shot in stop motion, with all the febrile, twittery fascination that the medium exerts; it has a magic-toy shop feeling, with unexpected objects stuttering into life.
6280|1|A preposterous yet entertaining thriller with Michael Keaton stretching admirably as a Hannibal Lecter-style killer.
9677|1|Reiner benefits from divine intervention from no less than Miss M herself. Bette Midler flings the usual zingers with fang-baring zeal in a part that plays to her brassy strengths.
35067|0|In the end, it becomes the cinematic equivalent of one of the songs Tunney adores: enjoyable enough while it lasts, but so thin that its ingratiating charms seem as much a source of frustration as pleasure.
71151|0|And here we have a prime example of why studios should not be funding the creations of The Wachowski Brothers. While visually dazzling, the film's paper thin plot and the cheesiness of its actors are a huge disservice.
16648|0|Yet another Leslie Nielson movie parody, targeted this time at James Bond pictures and their many spinoffs.
5733|1|The film would have been strengthened if it had been a little more willing to challenge Tupac's behaviour.
19002|0|The film's moral compass swings wildly out of control, blanketed in all manner of hyper-violent digital gore effects and a thick, black nausea of the soul. It's not even fun watching the monsters get their just deserts; it's just depressing.
16972|1|Let me just put it this way: if you've ever had a baby, spent time with a baby, or been within 20 yards of a baby, you know why this is funny.
55721|0|If there was ever a film to prove my theory that we, as a species, have lost our sense of purpose, Bright Young Things is it.
11956|0|Biel is not completely miscast in this role of the Other in the drawing-room midst, but she exudes a thoroughly contemporary air that never jibes with the Twenties tenor of the English manor-born in the decade after the Great War.
40538|1|Cameron has done an honourable and undoubtedly skilful job of tailoring his new film to the tastes of the times without too much sloppy compromise. He's made a science fiction film with verve, imagination and even a little wit.
6434|1|"The 1980s saw the release of so many truly atrocious films (Xanadu, Stroker Ace, Bolero, Shanghai Surprise, etc.) that it's absurd ""Ishtar"" became shorthand for the worst of the worst and continues to be blasted by folks who haven't even seen it."

62155|1|The genius of this classic opening scene is that Sullivan's Travels is both screwball comedy and socially conscious melodrama ¬ó as well as a satire of socially conscious melodrama, and a serious apologetic for crowd-pleasing comedy.
36181|0|A film about as funny as a seeping wound.
78696|1|A film that works on many levels, be it action, drama, or romance, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is recommended viewing for anyone who likes their martial arts with some heart and soul.
76177|1|Films about the Iraq war continue to come and, I hope, will keep coming. Among the most recent, The Battle for Haditha is especially notable.
42231|1|Both a fitting testimony to the courage of the thousands of Australians and New Zealanders who died fighting for their country and one of the most powerful cinematic examinations of the futility and tragic cost of war.
7241|1|...Paul Thomas Anderson cements his reputation as one of the most gifted filmmakers of his generation...

1741|0|Hey, wait a minute, is the movie supposed to be this funny?
19570|0|The Forgotten, though not an outright bad movie, is yet another frustrating example of a Hollywood film that simply lacks the courage of its convictions.
19833|1|So-so storyline, but Mary Stuart Masterson rocks!
63420|1|If there's a more remarkable series of documentary films, or even as remarkable a premise for one, I don't expect to see it in my lifetime.
81750|0|A resolutely humorless (though sometimes unintentionally funny) Dutch movie about three young men who dream of finding fame and fortune in motorcycle racing and, instead, find themselves. The search is unrewarding and seems interminable.
29923|1|It's the year's most go-for-broke movie -- weird, silly, sad, and the hardest I've laughed at anything that wasn't The Aristocrats.
10330|1|A sinister delight for the black at heart.
8831|1|Since the codes of science fiction are different from horror's cant, the patented Williamson method doesn't make a perfect fit with the material; Faculty's fun, but less fun than it could be.
15112|1|Outside Providence could emerge as the final sleeper comedy of the summer.
43356|1|Formulaic writing is more than made up for by awesome visceral thrills.
9064|1|It's a refreshing approach to the genre, even when revisiting years later, in an era inundated with superhero movies where each tries to better the last's visual effects budget.
62225|0|...enough to keep one's attention, certainly, but the film isn't nearly as persuasive as some of (Mamet's) previous work.
47999|1|Benjamin and Patton have devised a basic Prohibition era gangster story as a background for their newest musical experiment melding modern hip-hop with the jazz and blues of the '30s, all put together with a great deal of visual cleverness and flair.
29831|1|A movie that combines lurid melodrama with vast improbabilities, sexy soap opera with heartfelt romance, and cheerful satire with heedless raunch.
52391|1|It's a mishmash of homages to writer/director Neil Marshall's favorite B movies. That doesn't make it bad at all, though; it ends up being quite entertaining.
40566|0|A brooding atmosphere -- which is critic-speak for 'everybody wears black, and the whole thing was lighted with a single 40-watt bulb' -- permeates this dystopian thriller.
30840|1|There is something that is so meditative and lyrical about Babak Payami's boldly quirky Iranian drama Secret Ballot...a charming and evoking little ditty that manages to show the gentle and humane side of Middle Eastern world politics
30396|1|What sets this film apart from other quirky adventures is its internal coherence (both in terms of storytelling and visual style) as well as the humanity of its characters.
2096|0|Too clever by about nine-tenths.
45321|0|This extremely graphic movie is not for kids.
24094|0|Liv Tyler is radiant, but the film itself suffers from the same self-indulgence that always hampers Bertolucci's work.
44861|1|"A neo-realist classic that is very likely the inspiration for ""Wendy and Lucy"". The two make for very interesting watching side-by-side."
71388|1|A crowd-pleasing exploration of Shakespeare's most melodramatic potboiler.
39529|1|A taut, suspenseful, and fascinating political thriller.
4773|1|Proves it's better to burn out, than to fade away.
52448|1|The film is brilliantly voiced across the board, with special notice to Mel Gibson as Rocky and Julia Sawalha as Ginger.
9321|0|Joyless dreck, another dumbed-down teen comedy fired out of Hollywood with all the crudeness of a spitball.
40371|1|Likeable Chris Rock in a comedy about race.
59806|1|A nifty, crisp package, but not quite up to the standards of the original picture. A dildo drill can't solve every problem.
17439|0|Trixie might have worked better had it stayed with comedy, but once it lurches into melodrama, to quote Trixie, it 'can't go back to square zero.'
35206|1|There's an especially important central theme to this striking teen drama that gives the film a potent urgency.
75458|0|Gets points for sweetness and a nice message, but that's all, folks
39240|0|Hardly challenging.
11768|0|Unfortunately, its superb performances and assured camerawork are overwhelmed by dubious psychology and a clich√©d climax.
2457|1|"While ""Blow"" certainly has its moments of greatness, it tries too hard to sell us a product we would have bought had they not pushed it too hard."
42083|0|There's very little to tell about the story that you can't figure out from the two-minute trailer.
5805|1|The dark duet between Paul and the frankly psychopathic Annie is played to tense perfection.
17295|1|Though Pulp Fiction is only Tarantino's second film as writer-director, he creates his own world as confidently and recognisably as Harold Pinter or Joe Orton does or did.
29171|1|Gorgeous photography and a great musical score win through in a film hampered by its hopelessly slow pacing.
1632|1|Perhaps the film is meant as a pre-emptive sop to any resistance to a new medium.
11424|0|Even in period drag, this movie resembles warmed-over Forrest Gump.
2409|1|The performers are luminous.
32256|1|The first and best of Stone's Vietnam trilogy, it's also one of his finest pieces of work.
30091|1|You probably won't be missing out if you don't see this film but if you do, you'll spend a pleasant time.
10330|0|It may be Piglet's Big Movie, but it's a very minor entry in the Disney canon.
61351|0|I'd have a fit if I was ever again to hear Russo shout, 'Group hug!'
43019|1|An intriguing patchwork of relationships converges into a portrait of modern love in Playing By Heart, a wry, satisfying emotional saga.
37678|0|"Thanks to the clarity and cut of past 007 films, Sean Connery will sparkle forever. But with a dearth of action and only a fat paycheck as motivation, ""Diamonds"" feels less like a triumphant return and more like a cheesed-up cabaret version of Bond."
6073|1|Filmmaker Mich√®le Ohayon shapes her portrait of two vibrant old people with a fine hand (especially when it comes to interspersing historical footage), creating a valuable addition to the Cinema of Never Forget.
2007|1|A lot less poky than the original, and generally more entertaining.
24932|1|Director Alfred L. Werker shows off a flair for the material, and we get scenes that appear composed, lit, and shot expressly for the most evocative publicity stills.
47449|1|A story about the attempts of Baby Boomers to recapture their youth.
2532|1|"A tale of haunting introspection, unremitting power and potent symbolism. ""America"" ruminates on the corrosive effects of greed, violence, objectification and pain, and forces us to face despicable acts of a stand-in for our nation's worst impulses."
40605|1|Gossamer thin, but lots of fun nevertheless.
65261|1|A nifty little movie, full of all the lurid teases, off-the-cuff production values, and trenchant topicality that make exploitation movies the fascinating cultural time capsules and filmmaking treasures that they are.
72490|0|The strongest messages for adults are that we should purchase and consume...Pepperidge Farm Goldfish and dash off to Petco for all of our kitty's litter and chow needs.
15560|1|In alchemy the transmuting of materials between forms distills them to their purest elements. In film, the opposite is true. The more iterations, the more muddled things get. Hairspray is good at what it does but not everything it does is good.
76361|0|I'm sure her hometown audience appreciates the therapy session that the film deteriorates into...but for me at least, it got very old.
26384|1|A diverting, very well-made thriller. Far-fetched, but everyone except the most captious sticklers for logic will likely exit satisfied.
81446|1|entertains and has a number of interesting comments on contemporary human affairs
45971|0|Hampered by its convoluted plot and a marked melodramatic streak that counteracts the film's cool factor.
56455|1|The quirks of this Sleepy Hollow prevent it from ever being truly scary, but what they do make it is a quintessentially Burton film.
52040|1|There's no denying that this overlooked 1940 gem is essentially two films in one.
46893|0|It's not only a pointless resurrection of Blake Edwards' classic comic franchise, but a formulaic photocopy of its predecessor -- Steve Martin's 2006 remake.
7191|0|A little too muddled and erratically paced to command much interest. While some of the effects are cleverly worked-up, the picture seems more often to be on CGI autopilot.
11125|1|Bille Woodruff directs the comedy with a warm generosity of spirit, which gives all the actors in a delightful ensemble cast their chance to shine.
81795|0|It is testimony to the superior acting skills of Joe Pesci and Danny Glover that Gone Fishin' registers more than a blip on the summer movie radar screen.
50906|0|Most of the movie featured doe-eyed, orphaned girls either getting abused by a boozehound or doing manual labor
69652|1|Volckman and his collaborators have done a remarkable visual job that compares favourably with Sin City. The threatening nocturnal mood constantly amazes in a 'How did they do that?' sort of way.

59681|1|The Big Bus can be hit-or-miss in its humor. But the hits are fairly big and the misses are comparatively small.
68180|0|Each vignette is tantalizing but so short as to be stillborn, leaving the impression of an acting class exercise.
65987|1|Coruscating surrealism
38781|1|Mr. Murphy knows exactly what he's doing, and he wins at every turn.
4135|1|The script includes a verbal motif that reminds us of what binds the film's four central talents together: 'I want to show you something.' [Blu-Ray review]
74927|1|A fresh and fabulous Cinderella fantasy, Lizzie McGuire is a delightful charmer about a young girl who dreams of being a pop star.
8924|1|Hit and miss, certainly, but intense stuff.
13646|1|The action is excellent and nearly non-stop. Ogami Itto whirls the Katana and Naginata as nimbly as a marching band baton girl.
55947|1|A masterful blend of dark misanthropy and small-town hysteria
5432|1|Like Broadcast News, James L. Brooks' new film is a dark-edged adult comedy that hits the spot for those who like their romances splashed with acidic wit.

80657|1|The movie does a nice job with the period details, but Clooney still can't get the romantic comedy angle right.
53182|1|One of John Wayne's popular WWII movies, in which his hero shows the exepected rebellious independence.
22988|1|One of the best all-out, no-apologies, hell-bent-for-leather horror films to emerge from the beginning of the 21st century
62384|1|In addition to the fine acting, Twelve O'Clock High features some gorgeous camerawork by Leon Shamroy and one of the most horrifying aerial attack sequences ever put on film.
37373|0|Entry into the realm of disappointing horror videos.
21774|1|Clearly a labor of love, Fernando Trueba's docu is a great chronicle of Latiz jazz, its history, performers, and enduring appeal.
47427|1|A true cult film delight from the 1950s made for all eras.
17603|1|A clever, cynical and paranoid satire.
34054|1|Why put up with so much that seems insufferable? Because at the end of Eternity and a Day, Angelopoulos somehow translates a character from the world of dreams to the world of reality instantaneously, before your eyes.
20869|1|The best combination of japery and seriousness, without descending into the clowning that would be a part of all but one of Moore's subsequent adventures [as Bond].
74498|0|Needless to say, as a cringe-worthy and excruciatingly awful comedy, you shouldn't pay a dime of King's Ransom.
1017|1|A moving family drama.
17232|0|Should've left the first one alone
7170|1|Told largely from the point of view of the woman, this career-versus-love story still develops the perspective of the man persuasively, as Sanaa Lathan and Omar Epps reveal their characters' motives with nuances of expression that transcend the dialogue.
59277|1|Most alluring are the crumbling neon cityscapes, real world/cyberspace fusion and the musings on identity.
52236|1|A moving tale about family, friendship, and those extravagant teenage parties that somehow never make anyone feel like Cinderella.
9826|0|The sad fact is that the duck gets lost in what becomes a special effects film suspiciously reminiscent of Ghostbusters.
37838|1|This proposition from English writer-director Peter Howitt is not unique, but I have never seen a film that presents the idea so clearly, so cleanly, so provocatively.
74081|0|[An] absurdly bad movie.
54524|1|The movie version is so faithful to Dan Brown's hit book it should come with a dust jacket ...
32956|1|Martin Scorsese's long-ripening adaptation ... provides a much-needed corrective, focusing its attention on a man who is constantly plagued by doubts.

7587|1|[An] exciting adventure epic.
24967|1|Ralph Nader gives and he takes away.
55149|0|Her Alibi veers with little purpose from bland drama to heavy-handed slapstick, with rhythm, characterization, and plotting better suited to television than the movies
8525|0|Slick slime wrapped as a high-toned, girl-power shocker
23069|0|Tomorrow Never Dies is as overproduced as one of Carver's cable broadcasts -- incredibly noisy, flashy and busy without being terribly exciting.
37789|1|The first two thirds are a lot of fun and a showcase for Robert Downey Jr.'s immense talents.
54712|0|A shock for those expecting grown-up laughs, Curious George is that rarest of breeds: a kids' film through and through.
9371|1|I found myself responding to its fenderheaded foolishness... and I suspect that those of you with a healthy taste for the absurd may find themselves reacting in the same way.
6375|1|This serio comedy about nonconformity is well acted by Jason Robards and the others, but it's still a play
8043|0|The film's saving grace is in the emotionally impactful performance by Ed Harris.
40453|1|A two-fisted slugger, hammering across points about legal and familial ethics.
72022|1|Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie hardly qualify as a latter-day William Powell and Myrna Loy, but they handle the Nick and Nora Charles-style zingers with enough snap that you can generally tell they're zingers.

74115|0|Yakusho gives a good performance in the lead role but the screenplay does not go beneath the surface of the characters.

59135|0|a clever, if not wholly successful, slasher film that toys with the uncomfortable links between blood on the screen and blood in the audience
73375|1|Despite the film's bizarre developments, Hoffman keeps us riveted with every painful nuance, unexpected flashes of dark comedy and the character's gripping humanity.
1621|0|This biopic is soulless, underwritten, over-acted and, worse, just plain dull.
56482|1|This is a movie with genuine heart.
70225|1|A gripping and original piece of work, itself sure to be remembered as one of the finest films of the year.
40659|0|This film had very little on its mind other than making sure that the 12-to-14 year old girls who went to see it would be impressed enough to tell their MySpace friends about it.
58114|1|Lawrence proves much less irritating as an animated bear than he does in his real-life performances.
34526|0|Tears waffles so much between three 'war-is' mentalities - hell, redemptive and super-cool for explosions - that it's hard to truly connect.
24943|1|Though hardly on the level of great science fiction, it manages to produce an entertaining two hours...something very few of [Schwarzenegger's] recent films can claim.
62275|1|Too long, but highly entertaining personality film
33448|1|A painfully funny ode to bad behavior.
39604|1|"As much an essential missing piece for audiences of David Lynch's groundbreaking 1991-'92 television series (""Twin Peaks"") to gain closure as a stand-alone film, ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me"" is an alternately funny, harrowing, and bizarre experience."

77511|0|Never fully coheres or convinces.
42115|1|Flawed, but nicely grim sci-fi horror with a miscast Price
28295|1|Even when the script for The Quick and the Dead runs out of surprises, which is very early, director Sam Raimi keeps the action fast and funny, though he falters when he strains for seriousness.
41567|0|clearly the work of a guy who shows up and does his job with one eye on the clock. ... the promised fireworks never materialize, partly because Willis is constantly blown away by Blanchett and Thornton's vigorous comic turns...
76622|1|Superior gangland drama with a nod to Scorsese
38257|0|The Promotion tries for the dry, low-key vibe of Election, but its humor is not so much dry as evaporated.
21946|1|If the plot structure of UHF leaves something to be desired, that's okay because we're offered a mostly hilarious series of Saturday Night Live-style television parodies.
3531|1|Torrid eroticism tinged by a sense of menace . . . circles around its complex, conflicted characters before plunging into their dark feelings and hidden half-truths.
41452|1|...you could certainly do worse.
36787|1|As for the charm factor, I can't think of any screen couple this year with more of such an elusive quality than Ms. Otto and Mr. Ifans.

76593|0|Not only slow but uninvolving.
45621|1|It moves fast, conquers armies, kicks into hyperspace and spits out idiotic quips with unapologetic cartoon brio.
81778|1|Its intelligence is cinematic, feminist: it doesn't leave you thinking about women (although the subject was welcome) so much as about its own energy and wit.
15734|1|This tale of a marriage of convenience charms and amuses with strong comedic performances with a great script and some beautifully shot sequences.
56856|0|Each film is distinct from the other in its tone, which in some ways is good, but it also hinders any rhythm from emerging other than the fact that this club loves a certain city.
77006|1|The writing team is adept at childish malapropisms and the skewed perspectives of 5-year-olds, but the characterizations and plot lines are witheringly simplistic.
53669|0|The muddled Samuel Taylor screenplay smelled so bad I wouldn't wrap fish in it.

15611|0|All-star cast, headed by Anthony Quinn, Olivier and Gielgud, can't help Anderson's poor transfern of Morris West's bestseller, an international political thriller about a Russian survivor of the gulag who becomes pope; best thing is Alex North's score.
73631|1|A great Western that was unfairly disparaged back in 1994. The authentic Wyatt Earp is actually a much-better film than the pulpier, more-popular Tombstone.

58743|0|The pleasure is watching Connery shine as a roguish criminal in a story line that never gels.
54759|1|Amelio intelligently steers clear of lachrymose speeches, swelling orchestral music, and cheap redemption and instead probes away at the ambivalent feelings of parents towards their handicapped off-spring.
72543|0|In contrast to other recent documentaries about coming of age in America, American Teen seems somewhat simplistic, perhaps naive.
45938|1|By now, it should only matter that Moore has been right about every social ill he's addressed.
33664|0|Well, this could have been a lot worse, instead it's just a piece of forgettable, mediocre fluff.
47604|1|an enchanting, sweeping look at post-WWII life, real and reel. It's set mostly in a small Italian village, but the characters, situations and changes it depicts are universal.

2419|1|The worst of the series, but the chemistry between Mel and Danny is still strong.

14416|0|Trapped in a sitcom sensibility, the film never makes the vital connection with the audience that's necessary to spawn a hit.
25907|1|A style of pure ebullience
2890|0|It's with the focus on the police, though, that the script fails to truly connect.
66187|1|An emotionally-engaging testament to the indomitability of the human spirit even in the midst of the most dire of circumstances.
64869|0|Assuming that every generation needs its own dance film, Hytner revists the turf of films like Turning Point (classic ballet), Chrous Line (Broadway dancing) and Saturday Night Fever (disco) and blends together their themes and persona to little effect.

64502|0|This many delicious ingredients should have produced a tastier, more memorable result.
14689|1|Fluent, brave and touching.
9815|0|Despite the usual strained stabs at topical social significance, Frakes maintains a brisk pace, staging the battle scenes with panache and undercutting the absurd techno gibberish with crass but leavening humour.
5749|1|A real 1940s Hollywood treat.

2805|1|...it's always a pleasure to watch this ensemble of gifted talents do what they do best -- be spontaneous and funny and surprising. What we get is a master-class demonstration of the distinction between comic actors and comedians who try to act.
2789|0|Conscientiously as this movie has been made, it does not work as well as the novel did or as some of Pakula's other films have.
4364|1|It is a handsome production, an epic fantasy for younger audiences with a spiritual message, and it was followed by two more films in the series. This one remains the most satisfying and inspiring.

24512|0|It's easy to mistake Hostage for a plausible adult thriller that loses its way after the first act. But if you pay attention, it's ridiculous from the get-go.
12710|1|Easily the scariest horror picture of the '90s, a movie that can take a place among the most potent and inexorable of modern shockers, like Night of the Living Dead or The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.

65655|0|It must have been some kind of alternate universe these movie people lived in, because it wasn't any sort of world I knew.

80430|0|Clunky dialogue sets up the film, unlikely backstory drives it along, and it all concludes in a ludicrous cataclysm of cinematic hyperbole.
27071|0|An insufferably dull retracing of romantic comedy's steps, with none of the relationship insight or genuine humanness that can make the formula such a joyful one to follow.
39479|0|The special effects were fine, and were about all that was salvageable from this disaster of a film.
10163|0|Director Marc Forster gets the action scenes right but never shapes the film as a whole. And if Craig, a talented actor, wants to be a Bond for the ages, he needs to lighten up. James Bond shouldn't be all work and no play.

8247|1|Hartnett and Sossamon resonate a natural chemistry that infuses this mixed affair with uncommon humanism and sex appeal.
58874|1|Though its morality may be controversial, the film, an impressive debut from Boaz Yakin, deserves credit for introducing a new type of protagonist, a ghetto teenager willing to do everything and anything to escape his lot.

76202|0|A blundering New Orleans-set thriller under the spell of archaic stereotypes about Southern Bayou blacks.
8488|1|Unlike most action movies, when the characters bleed, sweat, and scar, one can't help but notice. There's an emphasis on the physicality of the actors here that elevates some of the scenes above the film's generally uninspiring intentions.

4409|1|Fine acting, subtle direction, good writing, in fact, a film for everyone to appreciate and enjoy.
7980|0|The problem for Tarantino in Death Proof is that the girl talk that occupies so much of the running time is anything but true to the culture 50 years ago. The setting is contempo, but the movie style is period
11133|1|The film of the week is 30 years old and hasn't aged a day. It's John Cassavetes's Opening Night, a truly mesmerising study of anxiety and identity crisis in theatreland.

81414|0|Yet another anaemic horror retread starring a cast of good-looking TV totty.
82025|1|No cheery triangle, but rather the director's rejection of his own Jules and Jim image as a Pez-dispenser of cushy lyricism
51093|1|The Good Son has a handsome, scenic look that sustains interest, and a suspenseful ending that is quite literally gripping.
38905|1|The most engaging thing about Mike Nichols is his awareness, strong enough to remind you of the late, great Preston Sturges, of how to use bland and idiotic exaggeration as a comic safety-valve.

66784|0|It's a soap opera strewn with bullet casings.
11721|1|Harrison Ford renders one of his best dramatic performances, for which he won his sole Oscar nomination, in Peter Weir's beautifully shot feature, which is effective as a cop thriller as well as a chronicle of the rural Amish subculture.
5291|0|The worst film of 1998 was also one of the worst films of its entire decade, but it panders so shamelessly in an effort to manipulate every conceivable human emotion that it was instantly embraced by easy-to-please filmgoers.

34370|0|Simon Birch packs the dramatic impact of a mayonnaise sandwich on white bread.
32328|1|Cinematographer Gregg Toland perfectly captures the wide open spaces and big skies of rural America, while the normally conservative Ford puts forward a sympathetic but radical plea for workers' rights and freedom for the common people.
69529|0|The writing isn't sharp enough for the film to work as comedy, nor are the characters real enough for the audience to connect emotionally.
50564|1|Savvy, detailed, altogether yeasty piece of nostalgia.

8388|1|Tsunashima gives a deft performance in a role that starts out as caricature but becomes full-bodied. Collette commands the screen virtually the entire time.
42661|1|A light hearted, fairy tale of a romance, there is not much in it, but what there is is a delight and will reaffirm your belief in life and especially in romance.
193|0|A 'what-if' racial story that doesn't pack a punch.
3450|1|The filmmakers' methods are questionable, but the power of the resulting documentary and the importance of the issues it raises are not.
3875|0|This, one of the most disappointing films of the 1980s, was a dud upon its release and has not held up well at all.
24946|1|There is genuine suspense when some of the haunting spirits threaten to turn deadly and some of the students look like they won't come back from the dead after all.
44582|0|The most leaden and uninteresting threads of the film's first half become the most important elements in the murder mystery.
11893|0|The orgy of violence, as ghastly as in any video game, should go a long way toward erasing whatever goodwill Stallone earned with his sentimental Rocky Balboa.
35185|1|One of the best detective thrillers ever filmed.
59676|1|While the plotting is familiar (especially after countless imitations), competent scripting, direction and acting make this above average entertainment.
6467|0|Perhaps sensing the chaos, Bullock acts as if she's standing just outside herself, not quite vested in the role, her mind seemingly elsewhere.
68230|1|Francis Coppola's 1987 Vietnam meditation was his best film in a while, though it's still something less than satisfying.
9488|0|If you like Jean-Claude's movies, this might be tolerable. If not, stay away ... stay far, far away!
21537|1|Woo more than delivers in the overblown action stakes. It's also patently evident that both stars are having a ball sending up each other's mannerisms.
14699|1|Dramatically, the film seldom fulfils its promise, and its pessimistic 'moral' -- that good and evil do not always meet with their just deserts -- looks contrived and hollow. Intriguing and patchily effective, nevertheless.
10497|1|Sayles lets the befuddlements and ordinary complications of life take its course like a winding, sunlit stream.
58859|0|The African-American film community deserves better than a mediocre comedy pulled from the cinematic icebox.
13879|0|As far as unfortunate cheese and silliness, there are still some gems here.
8551|1|Monroe shines in the superbly photographed and choreographed production numbers, most notably Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend.
38886|1|It's all very innocent.
47178|1|Lust - the word that speaks of inflamed passions, repressed longing and seriously naughty sex stands ill at ease with this rather languid exploration of freedom fighting during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai in the early 1940s.
6409|1|"Sofia Coppola's compelling, ethereal fable about adolescent loss of innocence is claustrophobic and uncomfortable, but profoundly affecting and gently funny. ""The Virgin Suicides"" advises teen years are sometimes best remembered as a long-ago vacation."
14743|0|One of the worst films to pass itself off as family entertainment features a flirtatious woman, a rich kid no one questions, and a brutal series of gags.
4844|0|"Oh well, Bernie. There's always ""Ocean's 13"" to look forward to."
22336|0|Though it never quite devolves into pure hagiography, the film's central tale of crack dealer made good is sometimes a little too hokey for its own good.
9687|1|Remains effectively squirmy, gruesome, and even prescient nearly forty years after its release.
903|0|Despite a sentimental streak a mile wide and a truly worthy theme, Penelope Spheeris' The Kid & I is a truly bad film, an awkward and cringe-worthy effort.
42799|1|A compelling family drama.
15674|1|Sirk benefited immeasurably from the fact that the chief subject of his crazy cinema was postwar America.
80017|1|It is not the best film of the year, nor is it likely to be one that I purchase and watch often. Still, it is something that should be seen by everyone and experienced by any diehard film lover.

49051|1|I have a terrible confession to make: I laughed myself silly at BASEketball.
16435|0|The leads bring plenty of energy to the story, but are shortchanged by thin writing that fails to build narrative momentum.
21005|0|I'd call the film innocuous, except that Max's gangster dad is apparently an Italian-American and the movie's main villain is an Arab. Do kids really need these stereotypes reinforced? There's also more violence here than you might expect.
21414|1|So many movies presume to instruct us on how to be young, and to insist we remain that way. Here's a rare picture that with all due respect -- and all due irreverence -- would like to suggest one vital way of being old.
7968|1|This is a tale of redemption and transcendence, of the hunchback of London Hospital, of the noble phantom who wanted to go to the opera, of Beauty and the Beast.
58849|1|A seriously disturbing film.

25709|1|[A] darkly funny and truly visionary retro-futurist fantasy.
18471|1|Cramer gives a spirited performance as the title character. Director Randal Kleiser uses a deft touch with his material. The result is a Navigator that's out-of-this-world fun for adults as well as children.
16494|0|The Wayans filmmaking clan strikes with another idiotic compilation of bodily-function gags and lowbrow obnoxiousness masquerading as hip comedy.
22237|1|As it stands, The Time Traveler's Wife is decent evening's entertainment with an intriguing enough premise and some strong heart tugging to keep the women happy and the men from getting too bored.
37853|0|This movie plays like an after-school special or a public service announcement.
3630|0|When the film falters, it's when it pulls its punches and gives us conventional horror that we can hold off at a safe distance, rather than uncomfortable insights that we can unsettlingly recognize from our own household experience.
4530|1|XX/XY is a lovely film and very smart, and it's for grownups. That's a rare pleasure.
73468|1|Seems forever young.
9614|1|The movie respects its young audience, it has a keen appreciation for what it means to be a child in a troubled world, and it knows that there's plenty to be said for the optimism that comes with innocence.
72314|1|Dated of course, being typically 80s, but maintains a certain charm.

81774|1|Star Wars take heed, there is a disturbance in the Force, and it has bad teeth.
39100|1|One for the die hards. The saving grace here is a knowing sense of humour so lacking in its predecessor, For Your Eyes Only.

17735|1|This hugely successful tear-jerker boasts some magnificent on-screen chemistry between Jack Nicholson and Shirley MacLaine.
14946|1|Newman and Woodward's daughter Potts steals the movie, but what makes it so watchable is Newman's reluctance to sentimentalise.
25294|0|Brother Sun, Sister Moon is a big, limp Valentine of a movie, filled with an excess of sweetness and light. What a shame.

134|1|Like the first Homeward Bound, this one has some very nice elements, including wonderful camera work.
76334|0|Man, aren't WASPs boring? The movie's simply not deep enough to be an art film, and nowhere near entertaining enough to pass itself off as a satisfying thriller.
48487|1|Douglas, always one of Hollywood's most vigorous actors, still commands the screen as Harry.
5971|1|A shining example of moviemaking magnificence.
57626|1|We need more fantasy like this: high adventure, brilliant swordplay, convincing magic, three-dimensional characters, arresting cinematography, and best of all, a good story.

80388|0|The movie is just not fun enough.
47412|1|It doesn't get any better or BIGGER than this
48395|1|Enjoyable Tracy-Hepburn comedy. Maybe not great, but very good
58635|1|Powerful story of child abuse. Not for kids.
14634|1|Basically, it's a videogame masquerading as a movie, but the action scenes are so loud and messily edited that they're tedious rather than tense. If it weren't so incoherent, it would be a classic.
10304|0|The elaborate costumes and set decoration provide the only interest.
45084|1|A self-important, egomaniacal, wonderfully choreographed, often compelling film which portrays the energetic life, and preoccupation with death, of a director-choreographer.
71428|0|not particularly original or effective

46067|0|Lizzie may be cheesy and disappointingly straight-laced but all in all she's a bit of fun.
10803|1|Meticulously recreating the era and the sensibilities of the time, Clooney looks as though he is having a riot of a time, be it is grappling in the mud for the ball, or throwing madcap lines at Renee Zellweger's worldly, ambitious journalist
68601|0|Along the way, we absorb bits and pieces of Derrida's ideas, but the total is insufficient for the newcomer to come away with any focused understanding of Derrida and only seems to fuel the dangerous cult of hero worship.
61666|1|Slow, but it establishes the myth, the cast and the look. And it's holding up surprisingly well.
9310|1|May not be entirely successful, but there are worse ways to spend an afternoon.
34317|1|[It's] a much-needed maturation of the Babel/Crash formula but also fails to rattle your bones the way those movies did. Pick your poison, I suppose.

56264|1|Finding Neverland is about the importance of hanging on to belief in something that transcends the empirical world. It's a gentle, graceful, and unsentimental film.
37013|1|Featuring cows wearing boots, a scene involving skeet surfin' (filmed in Cornwall of all places), and French characters named 'D√©j√† Vu' and 'Avant Garde', this is an absurd comedy that hits far more times than it misses.
78793|1|Its somber ruminations on passion and desire, marriage and aloneness, resonate with unmistakable force.
69118|1|Good, but not great Woody Allen.
15181|1|With two superb performances and palpable tension, the film has a strength that rises above the simplicity of the storyline.

65449|0|A few laughs are sprinkled in this equivalent of a lame sitcom holiday episode, but the broad comedy and treacly ending are unlikely to put anyone in the Christmas spirit.
33440|0|Here is a romcom that has been developed on a Petri dish in some unspeakable secret department at the Porton Down biological warfare unit, designed to release a gaseous vapour into cinemas, rendering the civilian population immobile.
78337|0|...the film's forgettable, padded-out nature confirms its place as a promising yet disposable high-concept comedy.
64557|1|The end result is an effort that starts to vanish from one's memory minutes after it concludes...

13372|1|Hanson delivers something ever rarer in film culture, not a new film noir but an old-fashioned total movie, somehow of a single piece.
5376|0|An utterly harmless time-passer, but one which has little appeal beyond its target audience.
44108|0|Murphy has a deplorable joke concerning a lost policeman's whistle for which there is no excuse whatever - other than it's very funny.
37555|0|It wants to answer the questions it's clearly too timid to ask, but the questions are always so much more interesting.
31161|0|Looks to me like a self conscious film that thrives on its own negativity. Studied, anti-establishment, arthouse cinema that gloats over its moral superiority %u2013 which is rather ironic.
63381|1|While we never doubt the outcome, Notting Hill offers an enjoyable narrative journey.
741|0|Jay Chandrasekhar helms this wacky vehicle with all the conviction of a defective police siren...feels more like an excuse for Chandrasekhar and his fratboy Broken Lizard comedy troupe players to merge and serve up their pet project just to kill some time
27212|0|Instead of permitting its characters to be developed naturally, Simpatico manipulates them to fulfill the needs of its heavy-handed plot.
14503|1|High-strung, melodramatic hogwash steeped in a measure of scientific fact. Emmerich takes it as seriously as he can and his movie, as a result, delivers more provocative fun than you might expect.
8488|1|"The next ""American Beauty"". The film expunges every inch of emotion from its actors shells - particularly marvellous newcomer Camilla Belle, last seen in the ""When A Stranger Calls"" remake, and former ""24"" cutie Elisha Cuthbert, whose never been better"""
1926|1|A nihilistic comedy about a trio of alienated youngsters, pic is bold not only in its art design, but also in its narrative and tone, a mixture of satire and horror with heavy dosage of steamy sex and macabre violence.
9354|1|A very frank and gritty story about two brothers.
6890|1|Paints a dramatic and surprisingly frank picture of the music legend.
31304|1|Lion of the Desert portrays a heroic figure who understands and exemplifies the spiritual dimensions of freedom.
8713|1|Fast, enjoyable, often witty action-comedy that made Eddie Muprphy the most popular movie star in the country.
68054|0|This is an occasion when it's far better to see the trailer and skip the actual film. Once the opening credits start rolling, it's all downhill.
81219|1|A moving, well-performed sequel
43300|1|Even if it's a bit 'foreign' and arty, it's also consistently gripping, thoughtful, powerful stuff, assembled in an unusual way that catches us off guard and never preaches.
158|0|Fassbinder's work here is muddy at best. His black and white cinematography limits his typically washed-out color palette while failing to connect us emotionally with the bygone era.
6661|1|One of the better yuppies-in-jeopardy thrillers of the late '80s and early '90s.
69606|1|It is witty and subversive, with flashes of magical realism and apocalyptic CG that both provokes and unnerves.

17465|1|A bitter yet savory time capsule of discontent.
51927|1|Gripping, troubling, and deftly acted.
24172|0|The animation is imaginatively conceived, but stiffly executed.
32944|0|If similar ideas hadn't inspired a dozen or so other films, Last Kiss might have been an exciting movie.
16208|1|Like the greater of Hitchcock's essential films, the movie is a skillful marriage of ingredients that tread dangerously close to the edge of reasoning while still absorbing them in impeccable artistic standards.
70302|0|As the film shifts from drab, duck-out-of-water comedy to madcap chase caper, things modestly improve.
34821|1|What makes the movie pay off is moving pictures of real action and of intimate scenes between man and boy that are all the more moving for being understated.
2184|1|Lone Scherfig has masterfully combined rather dark, serious topics with a little humor and a lot of humanity.
37727|1|It is something gorgeous to look at.
14447|0|Leguizamo's Chi Chi is the only one who looks anything like a drag queen, let alone a woman; yet we are asked to believe that it's Swayze's breathy Vida and Snipes' squealing Noxeema who've got their stocking seams straight.
66715|0|The script is bloodsoaked, predictable as well as meaningless, and there is little else to recommend the film unless you're after mindless shocks and like to be in the company of a couple of youngsters who are made out to be a bit stupid
39404|1|A surprisingly blissful combo of Brit humor and Soul music.
18532|0|The plot twists may offer something different from the series, actually having a little more in common with the first film than any other. However, this wasn't that original.
23410|1|Politics, propaganda and poetry are whipped into an exotic cinematic cocktail in Mikhail Kalatozov's delirious tribute to the Cuban revolution...
14620|1|Funny, revealing (about WWII humor) farce w/Cary Grant.
73006|1|The last half of the film is sheer nonsense, and less interesting nonsense than that which preceded it
65129|1|The film delivers honest special-effects shocks without forfeiting its good nature.
53755|1|It makes a good effort at being something like My First Arthur Story.
40155|0|The energetic action isn't quite enough to overcome an undernourished story. [Blu-Ray]
40480|1|My favorite Ingmar Bergman film, without question.
17846|1|If you are prone to easy weeping, you might even take along a washtub.
428|1|Smith turns in a terrific performance, nailing Neville's angst while allowing room for humor.
58389|0|A pastiche of a movie that lacks distinct identity and authenticity, made up of borrowed parts from scrwball comedies Frank Capra, Howard Hawks, and Preston Sturges.
25438|1|Brown Sugar needed a little more flavor.
19476|0|The movie runs out of -- excuse me again -- energy in the late going, and the invention of the humor is uneven. But Serious plays the title role with charm and lightness. His wild red hair makes Don King's look like a crewcut.
18582|0|[A] cloying road/buddy flick.
60579|0|...[takes] a dated, sitcom approach that reveals just how little the filmmakers think of their audience.
5255|1|This was a hysterical, shocking, and depressing movie that will have you feeling that you are old.
3413|1|Like its hero, extraordinary in every way. [Blu-Ray review]
35341|0|A bizarre comedy that stretches its central gimmick thinner than watered-down carnival taffy.
30759|1|Once the pieces fall into place, it loses momentum, meandering towards a contrived climax in which all ambiguity is swept aside and the forces of righteous democracy prove reassuringly triumphant.
5119|0|A feature-length movie demands a story, and this one barely has the substance of an anecdote.
42625|1|A great turn by Terrence Howard [and] real sympathy spun like gold from Taraji P. Henson.
10606|0|...a lesser entry within Scott's exceedingly erratic filmography.
75200|0|Director Michael O. Sajbel can't rein in the story convolutions or the pompous dialogue of Stephan Blinn's script.
41274|0|There isn't much that is new or fresh about Underworld Evolution . . .
74256|0|Held Up is a real dud, with few laughs, no characterization, little story, a cluster of stereotypes and clich√©s and just plain nothing for Foxx to do.
19408|1|Fun rather than thrilling, this duplicitous tale certainly isn't Stranger On A Train, but Hitchcock's weak films are still better than most.
1823|0|The audience is likely to leave this one filled with disappointment and a sense that some wonderful opportunities have been missed.
7031|1|It's much better than you've heard.
3829|0|Overall, it's hit and miss.
61322|1|A tightly wound psychological parlour game, expanded only slightly from its claustrophobic stage roots.

5093|0|Matthau and Lemmon put in their usual faultless turns, but cannot lift a pervading air of pointlessness.
51792|1|Using richly hued, angular animation, this vibrant, action-filled Disney offering is immensely entertaining.
69988|1|A quirky, sometimes hilarious and often touching comic fable.
34765|0|Just a showcase for Jaa's athletic abilities.
75764|1|Although the story deteriorates in the last act, most of the movie is of high quality.
9525|0|Perhaps those futuristic folks could send another Mimzy back in time to a better filmmaker like Joe Dante, who can do a better film adaptation of Padgett's story and beat Shaye to the punch.
24129|1|The film's flatly descriptive approach to exploring race in America probably felt a bit more intense and meaningful in the thick of the Civil Rights Era than it does now.
37542|1|A rare--almost subversive--cinematic treatise on the modern gangsta genre

17303|0|A hollow and garish echo of the sweet little ghost.

38469|1|British films are rarely as funny or as charming.
75920|1|This movie is nasty, shocking, hilarious, and close to brilliant.
48150|1|[The film] at first tends to be somewhat confusing, soon settles into a tense and suspenseful vein which carries through to an unexpected and ironic windup.
26968|1|As he did with The English Patient, director Minghella performs a miraculous juggling act, balancing his epic, sweeping story with the subtleties of character and detail that make Cold Mountain breathe.
14796|0|Speaks to our fantasies of rectifying mistakes of the past but drops the ball on a satire on small town foibles and marital discord.
53292|0|If this film is any indication of how Hollywood is looking at history, then the turbulent events of WWII are mostly about whom you were dating.
59560|1|Garbo does laugh! Delightful political musings.
65327|0|While Why We Fight comes across as strongly researched and well reasoned, it can be a slog through information that has been in the public sphere for some time.
18443|1|Brilliant documentary.
28057|1|Plodding, campy haunted-house chiller.
49029|1|As powerful as the movie was, Don Cheadle was better.

62189|1|It's fascinating to see the process by which skateboarding, in all its concrete grittiness, was transformed into a mainstream activity of consumer cool.
32554|1|Strong performances and interesting ideas make the film worth a gamble but it's far from the relationship classic it longs to be.
48446|1|Mostly the situations, albeit compressed, ring true; the characters are admirably multi-dimensional, and there are welcome doses of humor that compensate for any contrivances.

49261|1|As far as performance goes, Pine and Karl Urban -- Kirk and Bones, respectively -- do offer up moments of tongue-in-cheek allusion, but they sell it straight-up, and save the movie from becoming a list of inside jokes.
5222|1|Holiday Inn, is, of course, filled with the kind of pretty Christmas songs and picture-postcard scenes of snow and horse-drawn sleighs that make for beloved holiday movies. But there's also some darkness lurking here.
15033|1|One of Disney's greats.
70424|1|With her usual abandon, Leigh at first loses herself in Catherine's gaudy dresses and nervous tics. As the story progresses, however, the actress lets us see there is considerably more going on with this girl than first meets the eye.

57178|1|Thanks to an at times sharp script, solid lead performances, and a scene stealing supporting turn by Judy Holliday, Adam's Rib is an entertaining enough film to warrant a solid review. But one of the great comedies of all time? Not even close.
74952|1|The appealing theme of predestination is expressed by [Rain's] Mr. Jordan ... making this one of the few rom-coms expressly for Presbyterians.

46707|0|Even set against the Sierra Club beauty of Redford's Montana, it's hard to get excited by fisherman casting their lines into the water.
38463|1|Murphy's adaptation is bright, lively and fast-paced, but the movie is relentless in its outlandishness.
31431|1|It retains enough moments of twangy gallows humour, mostly courtesy of Paul Le Mat as Leon's corpulent drinking buddy, to keep the film from becoming a bludgeoning experience.

77612|1|A dumb idea that winds up being an entertaining buddy picture
59907|1|Willis gleefully strips down the action movie to a pretend game for children who like to fire guns and shoot bad guys. Machismo may never be the same.
19922|1|Sit-com material, ably done, with Keaton's off-kilter delivery a highlight.

6452|0|The story that screenwriters Jonathan Hensleigh and Robert S. Baker have concocted keeps bogging down in silly contradictions or cliches.
308|1|Schnabel can take on an apparently spent genre like the biopic and produce a pair of films that ooze vitality as they give their subjects a much needed celebration.
79092|1|Vacancy's an audience divider - a predictable yet occasionally classy film. Depending on your mood it's an efficient exercise in popcorn frights, or a cynical B-movie...
20261|1|The three leads are superb, with Hirsch probably the stand-out - he and Rasuk do particularly well to suggest more than the script's rather one-note characterisation allows.
24273|0|Rambling and disjointed, Protocols of Zion starts out pretty interesting and then begins skidding all over the place, losing focus just as it should be building momentum.

172|0|The makers of this sluggish, by-the-numbers action pic couldn't even be bothered to exploit the obvious angles.
77347|1|In several ways Jersey Girl is more appealing than Clerks or Mallrats.... Nonetheless, it lacks the smart observational-humor edge and often thoughtful boldness -- and, most frustratingly, the promise -- of Chasing Amy or Dogma.

32006|1|Bill Forsyth directs the film with wry understatement and has gentle affection for all of his characters.
9709|0|A high-octane, indisputably terrible piece of futuristic silliness.
22327|1|It baffles science and logic and rudimentary narrative skills, but it's fascinating.
49937|0|Much of the movie's problem, I suspect, comes from the vast use of non-professionals in dramatic roles, whose charismatic abilities should be restricted to the basketball court and not the dramatic arena.
5276|1|Surprisingly funny bickering couple movie.
11678|1|"If you had never seen ""The Abominable Dr. Phibes,"" this horror comedy would be much more appealing. The original is still the best."
13178|1|Not for nothing does the film open on a screen-filling image of the Hollywood sign in flames, for it torches almost every supposition that a film made to showcase Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes whomping on each other can only be brain-dead.
34840|1|Fifty years on the movie is clearly due a reappraisal. It's colourful, fun and as surreal as Disney is ever likely to get, this isn't as good as the books, but works as a cute introduction to them.
41557|1|Superior made-for-TV thriller directed by Spielberg.
76560|0|What this film needed was a whole lot more scenes with the good actors and lot less scenes of those Ken and Barbie Doll types.

76098|1|A screwball comedy with charm and sass it established a template that countless films have followed down the decades.
40270|0|The setting in early 1950s Indiana adds nice texture to the story, but the endless games with the usual ups and downs outstay their welcome.
67425|1|Perhaps it's a bit too knowing in places, and perhaps it packs in one pop cultural reference too many, but this is an in-your-face, look-at-me kind of debut, designed to function as the calling-card of a major new talent.
8610|0|There's only one performer in the movie who looks completely at ease with what he's doing: the horse.
1357|1|A low-budget horror/fantasy with some rough edges, Cronos reveals the dark genius of Guillermo del Toro's fecund mind.
287|0|"Everything from the design to Elfman's score suffers from a ""been there, done that"" feeling."
73141|1|There is some freshness in the film, much of it supplied by Jennifer Grey, who's appealing, thoughtful and just right as Baby. There's also some eloquence, although most of it is supplied by the wonderful vintage pop songs.
76681|1|This Bond for the 21st century is scarred physically and emotionally from his almost super-human efforts for country and Queen, and you believe there are layers to his psyche that will continue to define him in the movies to come.
37550|1|The highlight here is most certainly Julie Walters, who hams it up royally, and does a fine job of making her role as an aging actress more than just a cartoon character.
4676|0|Aside from the obviously Australian flavor to everything -- which can be entertaining at times -- there's no X factor to justify the whole exercise.
59764|0|Get it? It's just like that one scene you saw in that one movie, but with poop!
75486|1|It's a stark snapshot in which all is revealed about the 'daily life of mankind,' as the director once offered by way of description.

3302|1|A small gem of a Holocaust tale that will have limited appeal.
4350|1|Acts not as the window for the outsider into the spectacle of heavy metal music, as the filmmakers proclaim it to be, but an unprovoked fan's defense for liking what he likes
79432|0|Some strong performances make it go by fairly painlessly, but inconsistencies involving plot and character keep it from ever being more than marginally involving.
39895|0|There are moments here and there, but it's mostly ordinary, unimaginative writing. Midler and Allen deserve better.
1607|0|An unclassifiably awful study in self- and audience-abuse.
29638|1|Looks, sounds, and feels like a Carl Theodor Dreyer film.
40186|0|Pretty to look at, but it's a slow-moving, meandering work that isn't as complex or mysterious as it appears.

73512|0|Date Movie? It strains itself into a hernia to be one. If, however, you are single, you will be happy about it when this is over.
68208|1|While the film is the first of the genuinely bloated Bond movies, it only rarely drags.
20244|0|The movie, though, is not easy to respond to. It's chilly without being provocative in any intellectual way.
15408|1|It succeeds in bringing to life the reality of Scottish patriotism and brilliantly captures the spirit of revolution.
5769|1|Think of it more as a fun-ride than a horror movie.
77077|1|Though not one of Hitchcock's strongest UK films, the tale is entertaining and it contains many ideas and visua motifs that would appear in later, better works.

31056|0|Freedomland is a drama that plays like an episode of a TV cop show stretched beyond its limits.
7928|0|All told, Bright Young Things is one of the most depressing obliterations of a literary source that comes to mind.
520|1|Fessenden, who directed, produced, cowrote, edited and even has a part in the film rightly values mood at least as much as he does delivering more abominable snow monsters.
31147|0|This handsome but occasionally meandering drama admittedly makes creative use of several nasty leeches.
48392|1|Bleak to the point of near-horror

53516|1|Outstanding, uproariously funny dark comedy
22518|0|This is strictly 'Teenagers as Meat on the Hoof 101' stuff -- only more idiotic than usual.
63226|0|Tykwer squeezes every possible drop of melodramatic beauty out of this material. ...But the gorgeous visuals aren't enough to keep the drama from occasionally degenerating into beautifully produced hokum.
74013|1|An underrated little movie about small-time crooks and killers. Cassavetes and Falk are at their naturalistic best. A must for fans of gritty New York movies.
70086|1|Uneven adult romantic drama doesn't stint on sex.
31558|0|A really bad movie about a really important subject is twice the artistic crime -- because, however well-intentioned, it trivializes human suffering while squandering a teaching opportunity.
55892|1|The idea to center on Holmes and Watson as young men is good and original but the execution is rather poor and Levinson's direction is impersonal.
36530|1|"Like ""This is Spinal Tap"", only with more pathetic protagonists- and funnier!"
65147|0|There's something too artificial and highfalutin about the movie.

2768|0|The most notable aspect of this trashy (but unenjoyable) biopic of Jacquleine Susann, Valley of the Doll's best-selling author, is its running time (93 minutes); Bette Midler and Nathan Lane give two of their worst and broadest performances.

75374|0|Sadly, as with [director Eli] Roth's promising but flawed debut feature, its central conceit is more compelling than what ended up on screen.
45135|1|The less you know about the storyline the better, but there are elements of a buddy movie, a super scam, and love story in this film about a 12 year old wunderkind who has the smarts to make his dreams soar
9250|1|Still one of the best screwball comedies.
56961|1|Ivey is fascinating, cooing nonstop in a cozy Southern accent, friendly and accepting, but also observant and oddly unknowable. It's a performance that even gets better on second viewing.
33050|1|The Voyage Home isn't as dramatically powerful as the two previous Trek films, but it gives the characters plenty of time to show off their lighter sides.
55570|0|The book was explicit in its indictment of Clinton (or his clone or whatever), but the movie, while keeping most of the storyline the same and many of the scenes literally verbatim, still manages to tiptoe around the issue of personal responsibility.
76157|1|A real masterpiece of puppetry and special effects, an absolutely gorgeous children's fantasy movie.
38498|0|The jokey elements are artificial, and strike a note of banality that undermines whatever sense of transcendence the film might be attempting in its stark, sweeping cinematography and mystical, dreamy milieu.
39783|0|A heavy-handed yet curiously weightless swan song
14639|0|Another Spy Kids rip-off that's no great catch.
4470|0|Though lush in nearly every way, under the reproachful eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg, The Great Gatsby becomes ineffectual and rudderless.
73771|0|A completely laughless comedy, it wants to be a mild message movie about the responsibilities of 'knocking up' one's girlfriend.
69134|0|Unfortunate thesps take it all very seriously, while technical aspects are emptily polished.
9297|0|If Over the Hedge aims solely to entertain, it does so in a way that's mildly amusing but mostly hackneyed. If it aims to instruct, it weakens its own argument with the plethora of product tie-ins.
62688|0|You might guess that this movie will feature yelling, at least once, 'Let's get the hell outta here!'
29851|1|It also includes what is perhaps the Brothers' funniest scene ever: an immaculately timed and performed sequence with a broken mirror in which Groucho, Chico and Harpo look absolutely identical. A masterpiece.
25708|0|Can't withstand the utter pits of romantic comedy trash.
20805|1|If it's lacking much in the way of distinction, it benefits from an abundance of panache.
5671|0|I couldn't pay anyone to see this movie. Literally.
32729|1|Lang at his cruelest.
13488|1|Seen today, Amarcord is something of a disappointment, clever and moving in places, but also sprawling, undisciplined, clumsy in patches, and decidedly overlong.
78477|1|Guaranteed to put you off suggested Sunday outings for life.
77018|1|Fourth in series has lost most of punch
2535|0|In this world of Information Highway sophistication and virtual-reality marvels, the pivotal plot points are all rickety coincidences: an overheard conversation, a fortuitous phone call.
2453|0|What starts as a sensitive, involving drama about grief and guilt annoyingly degenerates into a trite thriller.
37080|1|This warm, celebratory and very public film is punctuated by sudden and luminous private visualizations.

22200|0|Debut director Anne Fletcher fails to put a new spin on umpteen romantic hoofers.
74688|1|Who would have thought that in the year of Spider-Man and Attack of the Clones, the year's most innovative use of special effects would come in a film about the French Revolution?
55985|0|It's hard to fathom why this didn't go straight to video, or maybe even YouTube.
25534|1|With final words that are both exhilarating and sad, and [a]...message that maligns wars of all types...Wertm√ºller has crafted a political protest out of the tenets of tragedy
35365|1|This glib talk-fest is based on David Rabe's 1984 misanthropic play about friends caught in the web of Hollywood hype.
54810|0|This is one flight that never quite gets off the ground.
78527|1|Brian wants to meet Drew. By the end of his movie, we want to meet him.
38701|1|What makes Venus unforgettable is not the fine direction and script, or Vanessa Redgrave's startling cameo as Maurice's suffering ex-wife, or Whittaker's award-worthy debut; it's that the viewer can't draw a line between O'Toole's career and Maurice's.
54279|0|Pacino. DeNiro. Armed and dangerous. In a cop drama. In NYC. Together. Written by the writer of Inside Man. Sounds great, doesn't it? Well, what could've gone so wrong?
24385|1|The type of crazed, folkloric epic that Germany's own De Niro-Scorsese duo usually excelled at.
43764|1|This is sharp, sophisticated stuff, appreciated on different levels by both parents and children, and even those who are neither. The film has impish humor, great adventure and more than a few thrills.
58721|0|The film uneasily skims the surface like a stone over water, hitting highlights at random.
15581|1|The movie is hard-hitting, gripping and a hymn to the excitement of New York City where it was shot entirely on location.
65549|1|You can say this: It is never boring.
76929|1|An absolute delight. Heartfelt and surprising from the first minute, no beter film has left Australian shores since Romper Stomper. And yes, I'm including Shine in that.
19705|1|For a good, healthy PG-13 scare, Boogeyman is fun for the whole family -- just don't bring kids who are too young.
64098|1|An epic retelling of the Pocahontas story that, despite its flaws, leaves you slack-jawed with wonder at times.
14242|1|The drumbeat behind the Thornberrys' energetic exploits may not be as explosive as its celebrated Disney counterpart The Lion King, but it certainly gives off a similar rhythmic radiance nevertheless.
31141|1|An expert at the kind of jumpy scares that will make most audiences spend more time in the air than their seats, Hamm turns everyday locations like bathrooms and bedroom closets into sites of terror.
17898|0|A tribute to and stroking of its subject ... And by canonizing Kane, displaying this hulking angel with such innocence, the film is soulless.
14808|0|Clearly, it wishes to be different, but anyone who fondly recalls the buddy films of the '70s will find it to be more of the same.
13718|1|Davies has done an admirable job of condensing the sprawling action.
50555|0|A broad, melodramatic estrogen opera that's pretty toxic in its own right.
14434|1|Proof that you can find patriotism in the most unlikely of places.
17304|1|Grand Hotel was the first Garbo film I ever saw, and she enchanted me effortlessly, despite the presence of the rest of the powerful ensemble cast.
11134|1|Ruzowitzky has taken this mothball-y stuff and made a rather sturdy, old-fashioned entertainment out of it.
72814|1|Funny movie about theater camp for teens.
3960|0|"You have to wonder about the mentality of anyone who would want to use the ""Cannonball Run"" pictures as inspiration."
14449|0|The film is worth seeing only for Woody's acerbic one-liners.
12298|1|Part of the deep appeal of this film is its undercurrent of yearning beneath surface ironies.
54989|0|A story of self-discovery Catch and Release is ... well it's horribly, horribly dull is what it is. It's like an entire season of a mediocre primetime soap opera squeezed into a couple of hours.
8199|1|A stylishly intelligent thriller with an enthralling performance by John Malkovich.
4911|1|Brings just enough of a twist to the series' conventions.
57409|1|Some of the film comes off as rather superficial, but there are moments of truth that ring throughout.
49666|0|Tracy looks tired in this draggy production; he died soon afterward, and it's infuriating to watch him sweat to inject fire into such pap.
17390|0|Dull-witted.
13952|0|The miscast and downright miserable company attempts zaniness against the exotic South American backdrop.
53407|0|The only real mystery ... is what is this great ensemble cast doing in such a poorly executed movie?
70974|0|On the plus side, just about every scene in the film features some really eye-catching print wallpaper. I think it's important to end a review on a positive note, don't you?
30262|0|The computer-assisted animation is relatively stiff and inexpressive.
17844|0|I can understand why these unknown child actors were involved with this movie but as for the grown-ups, all I can figure is that they were each fulfilling some kind of community service obligation.
33793|0|An allegory that's so impossibly overstuffed that it can't help but explode
18381|0|There are also too many examples of being weird just for the sake of being weird.
55915|1|As disturbing as he's supposed to be, Wilson is also the film's uncanniest highlight.
29056|1|[Labyrinth of Passion]...shows off the bright, gaudy visual style, the breezy manner and the exuberant energy that are Mr. Almodovar's particular virtues.
26381|1|Often ranked as the greatest movie sequel ever produced, The Godfather: Part II follows Al Pacino's Michael Corleone as he teams up with gangster Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) in an effort to expand his empire into the lucrative world of gambling.
13352|1|It's too long and a bit clunky, the special effects sometimes slip, and the plot seems at times to be made up as it went along. But Lost in Space remains appealing, with a great robot, a genuine sense of adventure and a good bit of ambition.
2415|1|In some ways, it is not a third installment in the That's Entertainment! series as much as it is a parallel history of the MGM musical.
238|1|A watchable futuristic prison flick. Decent B-movie thrills.
6111|0|Quite possibly the most revolting studio picture since the execrable 1980 Al Pacino flick Cruising
69739|1|"One of the better stories about teaching, joining such classics as ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips"" and ""Mr. Holland's Opus.'"
47618|1|It's 157 minutes long, but immerses its audience with its twists and intricacies as it plays out and considers the logistics and consequences of crime and police corruption, with a plethora of show-stealing performances from the cast.
21765|0|If you are forced to attend, then at least Bedtime Stories is tolerable, and occasionally fun -- when it forgets to be dumb.
41598|1|Sylvie Testud is nothing less than ferocious...Even in her stillness, she's compelling.
20889|0|Sid & Nancy is an honorable try, but it could have been better had Cox found a way to imbue the movie with some of the sheer zaniness of his Repo Man.
25137|0|In the real world, mental illness is a serious problem. In this film, it gives everyone a license to run around like characters in a Lewis Carroll story -- all of it set to predictable pop hits from the 1970s.
68623|0|We get the sense at times that the cast and crew arrived at a location, found the script bankrupt of real laughs, and started looking around for funny props.
18156|1|It's awesome
42381|1|They seldom get any darker than this.
13622|0|A rule: any time you see the movie's stars racing in go-karts, it's because the script ran out of funny things to do.
43669|1|Tom Green's narration is funny, but it's the antics and hijinks of the road trippers, which include run-ins with a pot-smoking grandfather and a stop at a sperm bank, that make this movie a hilarious trip.
3090|1|Jessica Lange is mesmerising in this uneven biopic of the spirited, politically outspoken 1930s actress Frances Farmer.
76842|0|Big Momma's House seldom finds anything funny for Lawrence to do in drag.
73459|0|There's wasted potential to spare in Lady in White, a low-key ghost tale that does just enough right to make the overall disappointment more pronounced.
14997|0|The Emperor's Club is the best pro-vouchers argument I've seen yet.
58941|1|A terrific monster movie with an edge. A bloody good time.
62506|0|Violence and profanity in unfunny, dated '80s comedy.
7074|1|It's a bit overloaded, though I love Luhrmann's obvious enthusiasm.
14780|1|A little bit overrated, but fairly fun comedy.
29334|0|Though something of a failure in its own terms, this social-conscience movie does produce a strong emotional tug...
12383|0|A hilariously pretentious drama taking a PBS approach toward sexual mechanics: Masters and Johnson meets Masterpiece Theatre.
72883|1|Not Fred and Ginger's best, but great Irving Berlin songs and dances
74384|0|In some odd way, the huge production scale and marvelous widescreen color scheme make Lola Mont√®s seem more distant and artificial than Oph√ºls' smaller-scale black-and-white films.
18353|1|I know how nearly every shot was done by this point, but that hasn't dimmed what is to me the essential magic of the movie.
13739|1|A film of unusual visual beauty and enormous intrinsic interest.
11026|0|Children might find the slapstick routines amusing, but for older viewers this is a mirthless voyage.
17644|1|This is a chance to see Murphy doing what he does best, and for that alone it's worth seeing.
62643|1|Not as much a film of social protest as a sexually fluid update of a classic Hollywood mystery-melodrama...
59796|1|Splendid... full of deliciously devious characters
20725|0|[An] offense of a ghost comedy.
8644|1|if you want to see Mother Nature kick some butt, this is your bag
55260|1|Without conceding any of his iconoclastic vision, Cronenberg has turned a genre film with classic Western overtones into a gripping psychological drama that examines the duality of man and his infatuation with the art of violence.
6353|1|It shows a fascination with the criminal justice system, and amazing access to the people caught in its wheels.
2627|0|Excellent dialogue, direction, and acting injected into a rather bland film.
41315|1|People love to bash the third Rocky, but this film is as invigorating as any in the series.
102|1|Sweetie and An Angel at My Table have taught us to expect startling as well as beautiful things from Jane Campion, and this assured and provocative third feature (1993) offers yet another lush parable.
11389|1|These elemental forces fuel a compelling narrative, but the second half of the movie starts to drift.
10066|1|Tales of Texas don't get any weirder than true-tales of Texas, and Hands on a Hard Body joins the ranks of well-done, weird documentaries.
75599|0|An interminable slog through congested headspace.
16264|1|Not surprisingly, the joys of Breezy lie in the 'how' rather than the 'what' in this charming May December romance from Clint Eastwood
15811|1|Back in 1994, I was a rookie young reviewer cutting my teeth and slowly losing the will to live watching the bloated Hollywood fare of Forrest Gump, The Flintstones and Lassie. Then, along came Pulp Fiction, swaggering with cool and bending all the rules.
40127|1|Although far-fetched at times, On Line gives us likable enough characters and several laugh out loud moments. Director Jed Weintrob has a distinct visual flair.
67863|1|Scabrous revues of myopic mythology
19634|1|McBeth's personal karmageddon builds with comedy and tragedy in equal measure, without being as long as the original.
42385|1|Pepe le Moko, made in 1937, begins with that tinny, swooning French soundtrack music that conjures up European movies before the war, but it isn't until a few minutes later that you realize you're in for something special.
78844|1|Worth seeing for the music.
55335|0|A loser in almost all respects, boasting a parade of nudity that you don't want to see, and over two hours of conversation yielding nothing of interest.
9624|1|Fans of Bresson's work will find him at his finest here. Mouchette is as pure as any film to come out of the '60s.
71739|0|It's a PG-13 slasher picture. This means the results are vaguely on par with having sex through a blanket.
49497|0|Suffers from an anemic, episodic plot, weak special effects, and most damning, membership in a virtually worthless film genre - little monster comedies.
12757|0|Dated '90s romcom has some stereotypes, innuendo.
16807|1|The picture is grand fun and sound entertainment, though silent. It's the old Chaplin at his best, looking at his best -- young, pathetic and a very funny guy.
30787|0|The picture would be better suited to public television, where its modest character will be more at home and its didacticism perhaps less blatant.

42389|1|McTeague is surely a great novel, but one reason Greed is even better is that Stroheim had more lived experience to bring to the material.
35679|1|Strong familiarity does not breed contempt, and that's all due to two pairs of words: Ashley Judd, Hugh Jackman.
7755|0|This original version could EASILY have been trimmed down quite some with plenty of repetitive moments popping up throughout the film.
63667|1|Pellington knows, as did the 1940s master of horror Val Lewton, that what you don't see can raise far more goose bumps than what you do.
3597|1|George's thriller reveals itself to be nothing more than a by the numbers melodrama that's only saved by the excellent performances...

7201|1|Two well-deserved Oscars grace this unflinching portrait of selfishness in direct resistance to selflessness.

11863|1|The moral of Dr. Dolittle is follow your bliss no matter what anyone else thinks.
49826|0|The Piano Teacher is the sort of movie that discourages American audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film.
37289|1|A lot better than it looks, thanks in large part to Bill Murray's offbeat performance.
6009|0|Props are given to The High and the Mighty in honor of being the first ever disaster film.
19085|1|Foreshadows what film could be -- spectacle reinforcing eternal themes of love and death -- and, at its best, would be.
16944|1|The makers of Shaun of the Dead have done it again. This time they have combined a classic cop-buddy movie with a quaint town in England, and yes, laughs definitely ensue.
78792|0|Just a more superficially sober version of Death Wish.
38094|1|Starting Out in the Evening is just a movie about a dignified old white man who writes novels, slowly, on a typewriter. Clever concept.
75470|0|A promising premise, a top voice cast and a studio with an impressive track record sets up expectations that Madagascar just can't fulfill.
81198|0|Bloated mega-comedy best for its many cameos
71213|1|Like Kissing Jessica Stein, Amy's Orgasm has a key strength in its willingness to explore its principal characters with honesty, insight and humor.
21701|1|Bigelow's artful handling of the magic and menace of the night is hauntingly apparent.
74149|1|The movie is breezily fun and every bit as entertaining as its predecessors.
40900|1|Curiously melancholy yet packed with laughs, the picture's funniest moments aren't even the famous ones.
18193|1|Spacey and Hunt create interestingly layered characters who are hiding parts of themselves from themselves. And come Oscar time, Osment once again may be saying, 'I see tuxedoed people.'
13924|1|One wonders why Dafoe is even in the movie. But Nolte is, and that's what enriches Schrader's bleak drama.
427|0|Deduces that the nudging awareness and recreation of a genre's tropes is enough
41143|0|What most critics probably aren't telling you about in their expectedly lavish praises of the film is its stereotypical and downright patronizing portrayal of race and ethnicity.
2643|1|Stone's strongest suit, however, isn't so much realism as it is his way of blending immediacy and insight.
65601|0|Anyone who experienced Seagal's films when he was in his prime will know that he is to acting ability what Robin Cook is to personal magnetism.

35246|1|Hearts of Darkness gives a privileged glimpse of the artist's hell, but it also says something about grace.
7861|0|This is a sad case of a film with high and noble intentions that features great dramatic performances, but it ends up being a superficial epic, diluted, limited, and strangely unmoving.
70699|1|The story is engrossing, and it's fascinating to see glimpses of both Japanese post-war society and their approach towards police investigation and forensics
72531|1|It's over-plotted, yet somehow seems a sparse tale, though Lange's performance, as always, lifts the essentially lightweight material.
14395|1|As a quiet celebration of ordinary women's resourcefulness, the film is well-crafted, sensitively acted and modestly affecting.
46006|0|Perhaps next time Coppola can open his heart without losing his head.
21896|1|So much more than a football movie.
39502|1|Director Luc Jacquet captures some remarkable nature shots, getting up close and documenting the entire frigid process, yet the film itself plays like little more than a PBS special.

59347|1|...a knowing treatise on the currents that run between mothers and daughters.
1364|1|The film discards serious discussion for Mexican standoffs and action scenes, trading the possibility of complex rewards for simple pleasures.
13160|1|Undeniably silly and somewhat dated, Blackbeard‚Äôs Ghost remains harmless, modestly entertaining family fare.
21858|1|Great thriller with two excellent actors!
79448|1|What charm it does have rests largely on Highmore's shoulders. As family friendly fantasy movies go it's pretty solidly in the middle, its resolve to take no chances whatsoever keeping it from ever being more.
16008|0|Rather than deepening the mystery and sense of intoxication, the picture soon becomes one prolonged and very bad hangover.
16952|1|Mamet has a special gift for drawing portriats of lowlifers who are harsh but also funny, his salesmen are a far cry from Arthur Miller's Loman in Death of a Salesman.

80845|1|Amusing comedy, but Pryor is not in it enough. Once they're together, it's gold.
4273|0|Iris fails to enlighten us into either the tragedy of Alzheimer's disease or the woman that it strikes.
56152|0|The movie's big problem is Mathis, who not only can't act but also is given a rather unattractive role to play.
20305|0|The result of this high-powered collaboration is a movie of such unrelieved genteelness that it makes one long to head for Schrafft's for a double-gin martini, straight up, and a stack of cinnamon toast from which the crusts have been removed.
29313|1|One of the most enchanting animated features in quite some time.
55180|1|Sharp jokes and heady nostalgia ensure it will at least please a wide audience.
66794|1|I hate wastefulness, and I'm sorry to say that this film wastes everything -- fine actors, an intriguing story, and viewers' time.
15228|0|While Atkinson thankfully gets to repeat the physical humor of Bean, Johnny English wallows in the gross-out antics of the Austin Powers flicks but has none of their energy or inventiveness.
27857|1|Clean Slate is a compelling offbeat morality play.
22133|0|With its stilted dialogue and hammy acting, the film has the look of an expensive production but the feel of a B movie, delivering the sort of undemanding monster mayhem Arnie's fans have come to expect.
29143|1|Subtle in its use of cause and effect, Lawless Heart is a light-hearted study of relationships and regret, of last chances and lessons in love.
8827|1|The film has been perceived as a satire on yellow journalism due to Hect'd experience. There's a key line in which a NY journalst is told: A Newspaperman? The hand of God reaching down into the mire couldn't elevate one of them to the depth of degradation

10655|0|A horrible idea, badly executed.
6999|0|This John Cusack-driven exercise in scorched-earth political comedy is neither as dark nor as timely as intended, and certainly not as funny.
43703|0|An interesting film weakened by ham-fisted writing and direction and heavy-handed revisionism.

46820|1|The cinema has seen plenty of coming-of-age tales over the decades, but few are as sweet and well-constructed as this take on the popular Ann Brashares novel.
6547|1|This slice of quirky life story about a classy, unattainable suit in a store window, is one classy movie as well, ennobling its host of eccentric and tragic, yet determined and struggling, vividly realized characters.
45339|0|A scary movie that keeps things within relatively safe bounds for the eight to ten-year-old set.
49951|0|The girl has a crush on her teacher and a flirty classmate (Sam Alexander). But eventually this plotting seems a distraction, or a means to blame the victim.
51883|1|The lack of information, the strange Jack Kirbyesque details on the walls and the absence of any outside world makes the environment of the film timeless and suitably, subtly existential.

9518|0|Problems are evident, and eminent, from a black-and-white flashback prologue in which four young men speak with old actors' voices. Yes, a man purportedly in peak physical condition sounds like a 70-year-old who's eaten bags of gravel daily for 30 years.

16141|0|Darabont is seeking to recapture the spirit of Frank Capra - with Carrey in the role of a James Stewart or Gary Cooper. Yet even though Darabont shares Capra's dewy-eyed optimism, his film's sluggish pace means he lacks Capra's screwball zest.

29180|0|We can't recommend this little item as a sample of the best in Gallic films. It is clumsily put together and rather bizarrely played.

61171|1|The brilliance of Peter Dinklage's performance as the ironclad loner is that he doesn't much care

15125|0|In 3 Strikes, empty jokes hang heavy, and you may find yourself fanning the air much as Uncle Jim's family does when the old coot lets one rip.
15980|1|One of Nicholas Ray's best films, the garish, full-color Freudian Western is an amazing, weird movie that's not easy to get the first time around.
37441|1|Doesn't succeed in everything it sets out to do, but as a statement about the death rattle of 60s counterculture it's thoughtful and affecting.
50865|1|Not exactly a whale of a time, but worthwhile
5438|0|It would have made a much more powerful short than full-length movie.
16625|1|Far from an anti-war film, Two Men is more in line with In Which We Serve (1942) than Oh! What a Lovely War (1969).

71596|1|At 160 minutes, it definitely suffers from Oscar Bloat.
54147|1|More enlightening than entertaining.
15848|0|Carpenter should stick to what he's good at-scaring folks-and leave the political satire to Spitting Image.
43435|1|One of the finest romantic dramas of all time.
30486|0|It attempts some gallows humor but is largely imitative, shamelessly ripping off every slasher film that went before it.
78385|0|A 1975 exploitation dud, this is the kind of movie Cinemax screens late at night. It's not just bad, it's execrable.
77245|1|Ozu's camera is observational, rather than intrusive; even when we get something akin to a close-up, it never feels like it's invading the character's space.

38647|0|The script is inane, and though Ferri has some funny moments, the acting is annoying or hopelessly bland.
5503|1|There are times when resisting the Disney line just isn't worth the effort.
12167|0|A trite classic.
10557|1|Butterworth has an effective directorial shorthand and the film is full of small, unobtrusive touches that smartly enhance the scenes. Kidman, of course, is magnetic; her absorbing performance makes this Birthday party one worth attending.

68226|1|Delivers a pleasingly high quota of decent jolts as the body count mounts and the TV airhead becomes increasingly hysterical.
6137|0|Pocahontas can't get stirred dramatically for political correctness, the finale will please nobody, and the songs are duff. That said, there are enough incidental felicities to pass the time pleasantly.
263|1|...a beatific 79-minute document that set out to catch the look, the feel, and especially the sounds of a seminal moment in American popular culture.
33218|1|Too ugly conceptually to be any fun.
77672|0|Unaccompanied Minors is packed with talent in front of and behind the camera, which makes its bland mediocrity even more unforgivable.
70205|1|The character of William Foster (simply called D-Fens in the closing credits) represents an element of our collective id.
63260|0|The movie is a multi-genre mess: Half campy gay romp, a quarter weepy romance, a quarter courtroom drama. All of it is bad.
8849|1|Burton wraps it all in his singular vision, devoid of bells and whistles and all the more potent for its comparative subtlety.
55353|1|Funny films have been in short supply lately. Don't miss this one.
69801|0|What we've got here is a trifle that is too clever by half. That's not good.
5060|0|The result isn't very funny, and its sexual politics are as muddled as you'd expect, but Faris is sweet and likable as the sort of wise dumbbell Judy Holliday used to play.

18400|1|The third in the popular Paramount series, starring Bob Hope, Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour, is considered by some to be the most entertaining.
49897|0|My problem was that I didn't care who killed Mona Dearly, or why.
64728|1|It's so well-made, so well-acted and so impressively (for lack of a better word) smart that anyone who seeks it out will find something to admire and enjoy in its craft and heart.
13295|1|Bristling with existential doubt and ennui . . . Carr√®re's half-nightmare, half-dream vision of one man's imprisonment in his own life remains satisfyingly unresolved and stubbornly unique.
7572|0|Given its unusual blend of fact and fiction, the film is a real head-scratcher. Like most -- if not all -- of Maddin's films, it's as bewildering as it is visually arresting. And yes, that means it's an acquired taste.
24719|1|[John] Waters skewers every aspect of mainstream Hollywood, using the truly demented Demented... as a proxy howl of rage.

9418|0|The pity is, it isn't even outrageous.

52362|1|Chasing Amy represents a change in direction for Smith, with drama before gags. A chick flick for blokes.
17622|0|Since there's no real-world grit to go with the grace, the story comes off as shallow and unaffecting.

219|1|Even as you laugh at these guys, you feel an overwhelming sympathy for them. Sensing that they love each other, you want their dumb, dysfunctional lives to work out.
36564|1|Director Andrew Stanton has pulled off a remarkable achievement here.
3084|1|Soaked in paranoia, Cukor's superb pyschological thriller is a period film noir, just like Hitchcock's The Lodger and Hanover Square, both set in the Edwardian age.
37625|1|A black, but certainly not a bleak, comedy, Gridlock'd is a wonderfully realized comment on the entanglements of beaurocracy at its most ridiculous.
62632|0|Vastly overrated.

38282|0|I've never seen such a bad film so well made.
483|0|The second panel in Haneke's trilogy (preceded by Seventh Continent and followed by 71 Fragments) offers a chilling and haunting postmodern look at isolation, alienation and violence, with a critique of mass media effects on actual behavior.

20300|0|It is a good example of the kind of mediocre, paranoiac sci-fi films that were being made at the time.
14109|1|A 105 minute long spoof by Finnish Star Trek fans. Don't worry, it's not as bad as it sounds though . . .
49057|0|This comedy is to this year's holiday season what Mrs. Doubtfire was to last year's, a mildly funny but utterly conventional and obvious farce.
43385|0|It's not the actors' fault that no one is able to break through the film's gorgeous but chilly surface. You watch Casino with respect and appreciation, reveling in its documentary sense of detail.
69455|1|An actor's movie, and the three leads give shatteringly honest performances.
16692|1|"Despite the director's refusal to come to terms with Israel's role in the Sabra-Shatila massacre, this is a pacifist film that ranks with ""Platoon"" and other classics."

12597|1|A beautiful-looking film with an ugly little fantasy at its heart.

41855|1|It plays surprisingly safe as a solidly crafted trawl through the didactic/hagiographic conventions of the mainstream biopic.
38054|1|Writer-director David Jacobson and his star, Jeremy Renner, have made a remarkable film that explores the monster's psychology not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted.
2412|1|Sprightly Sturges comedy that while not being one of his celebrated films is still a little gem.
69624|1|Bacon's performance is what makes it more than just another dead-person-walking-the-earth story. Bacon is truly a man possessed.
2052|0|This wobbly low fidelity romantic comedy is filled with distinctly unlikable characters and an unsubstantiated use of child sexuality that further clouds the film's morally rudderless course.

19430|1|"The case for its quality is solid, the music is catchy, and ""Repo!"" may just destined for cult royalty."
37256|0|Where it goes wrong is in the combination of poetic sensibilities and run-of-the-mill narrative cinema.
49200|0|Other than that split screen scene, no convincing argument is made to translate the story from the stage to film.
44477|0|The contradictory sexual politics in this lightweight slasher suggest that at some point it was meant to satirize the traditional mores of the self-satisfied female characters.
76505|1|Massive, hilarious and thrilling. I went to lunch a few times with a girl who despised this movie. I was forced to conclude that she's not very smart.
73104|1|A classic of a difficult and alienating kind, but one that really does shimmer in the mind like a remembered dream.
12773|0|Unfortunately, once the film turns into a romance, the movie degenerates into a snoozy Catholic vs. Protestant melodrama as Christina is wooed by a Spanish noble.
17687|1|What a buzz! lots of fun
81964|1|A sturdy, entertaining popcorn movie.
15548|1|One of the most powerful I have ever seen. The film's score and editing will haunt you for years to come.

53634|0|Picking pages from a novel and expecting the selection to make up an engaging and involving screenplay is highly optimistic. It is possibly exciting for actors and the director, but it doesn't work for the audience.
3848|0|With a budget of perhaps 100, half the movie involves people having their heads ripped off with the rest devoted to porn stars jiggling their plastic boobs before being shot in the head. Someone please shoot me, too.
80925|1|Of all the films to premiere at Sundance 2000, there is one movie that best represented what indie film is supposed to be.
8823|1|Scott's approach to his material seems essentially a stylistic one; it imposes itself upon the story rather than visa-versa, giving an account of the Napoleonic wars that lacks passion and depth, despite the expert visuals.
12769|0|Overall, Zucker's cinematic middle finger is about as funny as an exploding toilet seat for hemorrhoid-induced senior citizens...a dreary picture mired in sophomoric sludge.

26130|1|Dirty Harry sequel addresses sexism; lots of violence
11083|1|Zhang Yimou's latest film is deceptively emotive, its power hidden behind a smoke screen of comedy. We start by laughing but by the end we have tears on our cheeks.

74155|0|In the end, it's all just lost in the dust.
68519|0|It reads like a Cinemax special event, and as good as Leguizamo and Waterston (daughter of Sam) are, the skeevy, fantasy-fulfillment plot that drives David Ross' movie is uncomfortably risky business.
36503|1|What the story lacks in depth, it at least partially makes up for in pop culture kitsch.

35123|1|Completely disarming and absolutely delicious.
67168|1|Selim erases the cultural barrier between the eras and makes Olaf and Inge's tentative, forbidden romance seem as beautiful and as tender, and as urgent, as anything that might happen in the present day.
66688|1|Towards the end you wish they'd just get it over with, but this film usually overcomes even the most cynical viewer's resistance.

68939|1|An all-star bitch fest, slickly served.
52459|1|A thriller aboard the Trans-Siberian line, stretching roughly 5,000 miles from Beijing to Moscow, should be a cinch, right? Not so fast, Casey Jones.
47409|0|The feature is better executed in a shoot-first-ask-questions-later style that encourages silence and brutality. Once the material is asked to explain itself, the entertainment value of the film curdles immediately.
37040|1|Though flawed, this is a mature discussion of loss, denial and sanity that engages both the audience's heart and its head.
39265|0|Somewhat surprising twist at the end makes MR. 3000 interesting, but this happens too late to improve generally disappointing impression of this film.

46085|1|Those who loved the Clash or Strummer will be enthralled throughout.
15237|0|Too much time is wasted showing how these people are joined, instead of what those connections mean and why these characters all belong in the same movie.
1772|0|4Ever has the same sledgehammer appeal as Pokemon videos, but it breathes more on the big screen and induces headaches more slowly.
54474|1|It has more than a few surprises packed up its sleeve, alongside the sharp, disemboweling metal hook.
15124|0|Maybe the screenwriters were chemically altered when they decided that this stoner comedy was funny.
20551|0|What defeats Austin and Dr. Evil in the new movie is what brought them down the last time: Myers' inability to know what jokes need to be taken further, and what jokes should be cut short.
3722|0|A clone of the first film except with a small twist...
39721|1|Not a lot of relation to the truth, but with all those Jolson songs on the soundtrack it hardly matters.
53845|0|Isn't this the same sort of pandering, middle-brow movie that Chris Rock used to say really means things about in his stand-up act?
39762|1|Amidst the dry humour, the film is chilling, because it rings far too true.
48370|1|An hour and a half of solid entertainment.

29825|1|Like the role itself, Cage is clearly in service here to a fabled but fading star, and he seldom slips on that second banana.

68185|0|Foxy Brown dubiously embraces its inner minstrel show
2572|0|The film doesn't work, and indeed seems to have no clear idea of what its job is, and yet (sigh) there is the temptation to forgive its trespasses simply because it is utterly, if pointlessly, original.
47734|1|Raimi isn't effective with his actors, and the dialogue lacks smart menace, but his canny visual sense carries many a scene.
5057|0|If you're not a die-hard Murphy fan, your enjoyment of Norbit will depend entirely on how funny you find fat suits and fart jokes. Worth missing.

47891|1|A poor man's 'Silence of the Lambs' crossed with 'Insomnia.' And that makes it at least a decent popcorn movie.
19509|1|The film is at once funny and, in its depiction of the scant differences between art and megalomania, somewhat frightening.

5102|1|Quirky, although not altogether successful, cinematic reading of The Who's rock opera.
29175|0|Adam Sandler, of course, is no Burt Reynolds. But then neither is Burt Reynolds these days, judging by his performance as the team's crusty mentor.
826|0|Great music and costumes, but with a woeful plot and jaw-droppingly stilted dialogue. Cuban-born Garcia's main complaint against Fidel seems to be that rich, corrupt Cubans could no longer dance the night away.
6489|1|Another charming entry from Powell and Pressburger.
65188|1|Not to everyone's taste, certainly, but those of an anthropological bent will appreciate Quest For Fire's admirably detailed portrayal of early man's struggles for survival.

14050|1|Allen is one of the most recognizable, and least protean, performers.... [P]erhaps ... someone else as Zelig ... could have got the idea across without the blandly explicit dialogue and brought more dimensions to the role, besides.
32181|1|Very similar to the edgy animated TV show.
4445|1|May not be historically accurate, but offers a lot of punch for the buck. A tough, guilty-pleasure Western.
23522|1|Geek coolness abounds.
7357|1|You leave slightly asquirm. You know it will linger. It becomes a clammy, chilly movie building toward a revelation that you cannot predict. As I say: I cannot tell you. You'd hate me if I did. I can only say, don't look now, but look sometime.
20734|1|Film's notorious torture scene means adults only.
25227|1|A restrained, nearly austere ensemble drama that manages to intertwine a dozen different stories without tripping up on any of them, it relies on real-life survivor testimony for almost every line and incident, to immensely moving and dignified effect.
74|0|The movie isn't terrible and I certainly liked the superhero aspect of it, but the romance doesn't work and it has a rushed, sloppy feel throughout.

24113|0|It would be one thing if McTiernan were saying something about truth's impenetrable nature -- really he's just jerking viewers into a state of indifference.
9311|0|What's really disappointing is the undistinguished animation: the film looks and plays more like the Disney shorts than the Disney features.
19592|0|This is a terrific story with lots of wonderful ideas swirling around inside it, and a few genuinely wonderful sequences. But the film suffers from a complete lack of attitude or style.
8419|1|It's less about battlefields and weaponry than it is about personality conflicts and the agonizing frustration that boils inside people who want to put positive changes into effect, but are too entangled in red tape to do much of anything.
74468|1|As world events have proved time and again, this is a timeless story, rooted in an era long before anyone had thought of Spandex or terrorist attacks.
57648|0|A disappointing segement of the series
49228|0|The dreamlike amber washes and comic visual asides stress the otherness of the pair's reality, but seem to offer a limp excuse for their deluded exemption from empathy.
20634|1|Often melodramatic and manipulative but it is solid, involving filmmaking so one willingly takes the ride it offers.
18116|0|The result? A cautionary tale about boys and their toys and what happens when a star, Will Smith, and a director, Barry Sonnenfeld, are given way too much money to play with.

71779|1|It's Sienna Miller's star that shines brightest in this heartbreaking cautionary tale.
26174|1|Nora Ephron's Sleepless in Seattle is a feather-light romantic comedy about two lovers who meet for the first time in the last reel. It's a stunt, but it's a stunt that works far more effectively than anybody in his right mind has reason to expect.
39457|0|A murky, muddled, miserable mess, Righteous Kill spends 101 minutes failing to achieve what Heat managed in just six.
72780|0|This pudgy, obvious DeNiro is definitely not the one I grew up admiring.
40432|1|The film does maintain a powerful mood throughout, a kind of stringency, and the fate of the humans fades into insignificance as the film draws to a bleak close.
19046|0|Worst of the series, Jason doesn't really take anything.
18430|1|An unknown delight.

39730|1|I'm not generally a fan of vegetables but this batch is pretty cute.
14798|1|All a bit too earnest, despite the seriousness of the subject, with Fonda setting her jaw and stepping into father's footsteps as Tinseltown's very own protector of humanity; but it's tightly scripted and directed, and genuinely tense in places.
15882|1|The kind of film people call 'uplifting,' and while it is that much of the way, there are times when it's so oversaturated with sweetness and light, it's likely to uplift more cynical viewers from their seats in the movie theater. No matter.

14497|1|The filmmakers are too wrapped up in politeness and refuse to hold the characters responsible for their despicable actions, turning them all into victims of circumstance instead.
11391|1|Memento is one of those jigsaw puzzles whose pieces snap together more tightly with each viewing. Fueling it all is a performance by Guy Pearce that's as indelible as the tattoo ink covering his body.

54293|1|Well-acted and soul-stirring drama about miracles and the clash between reason and faith.
52111|1|The performances never falter, and even James Horner's heavy-handed score can't dim the film's unfathomable, unshakable ending.
62324|1|The result is a film of devastating irony and deep compassion.
16495|1|while the film, concerned as it is with the brotherhood of man, is undoubtedly humanist in its philosophy, there are enough shades of grey to cast long shadows over its apparently sunny outlook.
22627|1|The movie is fun to watch, with an attractive cast.
49991|1|Right up there with Billy Wilder's very best work.
76314|0|Essentially, then, the film is an excuse for Tommy Lee Jones to do his craggy hard man act in a house full of scantily-clad cheerleaders.

108|0|What makes this one worth a peek is that the role of a pasty-faced zombie-vampire is played by no less than Humphrey Bogart!
24824|1|"Half-baked but occasionally hilarious, National Lampoon's Vacation gets a reasonable amount of mileage out of depicting the disaster-prone journey of a ""typical"" family of four, the Griswolds of suburban Chicago."
40913|0|Too concerned with being quirky and endearing and soon runs out of local charm.
58316|1|A hulking tyrannosaur of a movie, lusty and fierce, crashing around for all the world to see, majestic in its size and scope though it's also an instant anachronism.

7652|1|Offers a whole lot more than just Duvall's flawless performance.

9933|1|What Redford accomplishes is to provide an excellent portrait of how well families can hide their inner turmoil from the prying eyes of outsiders.
27488|1|It's Songcatcher's songs, not its story, that linger.
76216|0|There are many funnier things in the world. Like the flu, for example.
52193|1|By the end of the film, we've more or less given up trying to figure out how the characters are making their deductions; we just have to take it on faith that somehow everyone knows to go to a specific address in Moscow.
66935|1|As a film, Maxed Out occasionally loses its way with glib choices (get ready to get tired of the song Money) and odd diversions (a segment with a Realtor begins the movie with a whimper, not a bang). But as a cry of outrage, it's spot-on.
4964|1|A touching tale of friendship lost and found

9090|1|This is one of those films that manages to overcome the limitations of it's genre and become something a bit more.
907|1|Zinnemann shows a knack for suspense and moral ambiguity that he unfortunately abandoned in his later Oscar-mongering prestige pictures.
3110|0|This movie is an ecclesiastical disaster and, like the Rector of Stiffkey, Williams should be thrown to the lions.
23802|1|This is on the whole a striking directorial debut, at once scary and erotic, with lots of sidelong touches in the casting, direction, and script.
38214|0|A limp, poorly structured would-be romantic comedy.
37581|1|A memorable story of understanding across cultures.

52909|1|Foster's scenes where she is utterly surprised by Hopper's lack of knowledge of the world, are so inviting without being condescending, eerily reminiscent of how she responded to De Niro in Taxi Driver.
17034|0|A good example of the kind of soporific nonsense that won rave reviews and armloads of Academy Awards back in the 50s, while the finest work of Ford, Hawks, and Hitchcock was being ignored.
16185|0|Bollywood/Hollywood, like this spring's slightly better cultural hodgepodge The Guru, simply offers no compelling reason to fork over your movie dollars.
4229|1|A most chic Guernica, sumptuously abstract and visceral
20462|0|Given a can't miss genre and a star at the top of the field, Ferrara turns in a big disappointment here
12381|0|It's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong.
9147|1|...were it not for the steady, understated presence of Roy Scheider as Fosse stand-in Joe Gideon, the whole thing might well do up in a burst of spontaneous combustion, spraying sequins and feather boas in all directions.
38189|0|Exposes the darker side of Benny from L.A. Law.
18421|1|Shira Geffen's script is a poignant intersection of the regrettable past and the transitions that must occur to move on. In this 60th-year celebration of Israel, this film feels like the whole country.
7456|0|The Beach is not a terrible movie, just an insubstantial one.
11178|0|It's patronizing and clumsily manipulative, and top banana Jackie Mason is upstaged by the gopher puppet.
52026|1|"The day is not a redo; it's a ""one more."""
16751|1|As brilliant and perplexing as the filmmaker himself.
39804|1|What it finally adds up to is a huge mixed bag of waxworks and daring, a film that is furiously ambitious even when it goes flat, and startling even when it settles for eerie, movie-of-the-week mimicry.
77847|0|The mystery is barely there, and nobody really cares, as long as Chase gets to ham it up under a wider array of fake moustaches and silly accents.
76558|1|An infectiously acerbic romantic comedy with liberal doses of pop culture and media satire thrown in for good measure.
20981|0|This is no Rudolph.
485|1|While it weakens in its final stretch...A History of Violence succeeds enormously thanks to the strength of its direction and performances.
61451|1|Much as already been made about the pride and honor of the Japanese, but as a people they have rarely, if ever, been depicted as fully human characters in American war movies. It's amazing to think what Clint Eastwood has done here.
48030|1|Visually stylish, thematically creepy.
39217|1|. To use phone language, it doesn't put you on hold for one second. .
8170|1|Set in a downtown restaurant, this is a small, well-acted (particularly by Danny Aiello) quintessentially New York film that recalls indie movies of the 1980s.
2574|0|Instead of effervescent and mercurial, the movie is simply muddled. What happened?
49064|1|Henry Fonda stars, as brilliant as ever.
15166|1|Captures authentic truth by refusing to lionize its far-from-perfect subject.
73968|1|...better than a lot of the post 9/11 espionage films that Hollywood has made.
20475|1|Dances with Wolves is as genuine an artistic triumph as they come; a spellbinding American classic that tastes the tears of a country in the midst of all its incomparable beauty.
71087|0|Forgettable camp comedy is fine for kiddie laughs.
17898|1|A commercial picture of high box office potential, first by assembling the most impressive aggregation so far of strictly Bradstreet screen names, and then by filming the play practically unaltered in form.
27050|1|Though familiar as an old shoe, this is straightforward and well told.
64791|1|Full of murder and deceit; too violent for kids.
19018|1|One story, two versions, each from Woody Allen, so you know you're in for it.
74893|1|Gere is convincing in a role that he most likely would have not taken even five years ago.
48794|1|Gregory Peck is miscast, but the film is entertaining enough.
1263|1|The exquisite balance of unadorned artistry and emotional intensity that defined Au Hasard Balthazar is less skillfully balanced here.
58797|1|The Corporation is overlong, yes, and opinionated, true. But it's also fine journalism.
16703|1|A serviceable entry in the low-budget horror column, and makes the most of its limited resources with stirring imagery and a full-blown performance by its star.
2878|1|"""Radio Days"" is so ambitious and so audacious that it almost defies description."
39760|1|Locating both Claire's loneliness and Jay's anger as partial outgrowths of their detested profession handing out parking meter violation tickets, Expired coasts along on a distinctively odd wavelength.
47341|1|Its heady mix of sexual politics and tangled relationships requires repeated viewing
33915|1|if there was any justice in the world we'd be seeing reruns of this on TNT every Sunday instead of endless repeats of Sixteen Candles and its ilk
15114|1|True, the various strands are never bound together, but with material this sumptuous it really doesn't matter.
61141|1|"If it doesn't sustain the high level of lunacy ""Guffman"" did, it's still a delight. Like the best comedies, it plants its jokes deep in your brain and you find yourself laughing at them again hours after the film has ended."
68545|1|This is thoroughly entertaining with an important message. And with its above-average animation it's also well worth seeing on a big screen.
54538|1|The rich, dark production is the 25th directorial turn by Clint Eastwood and is perhaps his best work yet.
53652|0|It's pretty campy-silly, but it's surprisingly watchable for some reason, maybe because of the name-brand actors sleazing it in this Skinemax would-be classic.
37997|1|An offbeat looking-for-love comedy with enough fresh notes to please even jaded viewers.
75397|1|... the make-up is inspired and Oskar Homolka steals the show as the long suffering, whipped-into-submission servant Krull.
62691|1|Field has told a great story with true internal passion
15750|1|While this is no Harold and Maude -- one of the best films about an older woman and younger man -- Tadpole has an irresistible charm.
5691|1|Makes it clear Hollywood wanted it both ways: It benefitted from the richness that gays added to films, but didn't want to acknowledge their sexuality.
65297|1|What distinguishes Wonderland are its independent touches -- an unusual soundtrack featuring mainly samba music, wide-ranging cultural references, and a production that is ensemble- rather than star-driven.
30457|0|Director Jesse Dylan, desperate to avoid yawns, flails madly with staging, editing, slow motion -- any trick he can think of, whether it fits or works or not.
6005|0|This compilation of four cinematic short stories is an uneven affair.
62619|0|None of the performances work.
54586|1|Connery brings out a vastly appealing dorky-kid side of Ford we haven't seen before in the Indy films, and Ford parries with Connery angrily yet lovingly.
60031|0|Tries for both civilized wit and primitive joy -- and mostly misses both.
42142|1|A deft morality tale about the engines of sexual desire and jealousy.
71143|1|Che Two is deeply impressive: austerely confident, coherent and mysterious.
67793|1|Gere has so much fun in his role it's almost unfair that he was paid for his efforts.
66883|1|Looks and sounds so good it makes your heart thump.
18088|0|Yet another (over)extended rock video masquerading as an Asian art film from Hong Kong's shade-laden king of cool.
16881|0|Did director Bruce Beresford have to ratchet up the saccharine of an innately sentimental story?
15655|1|Not by any means the masterpiece of fond memory or reputation, although the first twenty minutes are astonishingly fluid and brilliantly shot by Karl Freund.
58728|1|This romantic sudser is darker than those of its day, as it shockingly deals with matters Hollywood had previously kept under wraps.
13332|0|Not unpleasant, but the situations (including the inevitable invasion of women aboard the sub) are horribly familiar, and the dialogue none too inspired.
13350|1|It stands alone and it reduces almost everything else you're likely to see this season to the size of a small cinder.
60871|0|Too dull to be unintentionally funny.
28527|1|The Pursuit of Happyness is a very Hollywood film, which could be good or bad depending on your point of view. It tries very hard to be profound and inspirational, but ultimately it's not up to the task.
18552|0|A great deal of screen time is devoted to the false intellectualism and forced mannerisms of dinner party conversations.
38640|1|A weird speed freak trip comedy that has all the trippers spinning out-of-control.
3284|0|The important issues raised by the film- centered on the cultural, racial and moral struggle that took place on the American frontier-are glossed over in favor of a juvenile fantasy of male bonding around the campfire.
6633|0|Combs is still cool but the suroundings don't do it for me.
10637|1|Silly, early-Hanks fun
4819|1|Action-Packed good fun with a killer soundtrack
13269|1|Breezy thriller fun from start to finish with all the Hitchcockian flourishes you want (and the cameo, yes).
34638|1|The best film of 2004. A throwback in more than just its look, Guy Maddin's latest brings new life to the melodrama.
25279|0|Will the Mayor learn to dip his fingers in something more filling than holy water? Will Vianne find true love? Will eating too much ganache before finishing your haricots verts give you a stomachache?
59613|1|There's a special place in my heart for movies that create new worlds for us to inhabit.
38368|0|Seagal barely works up a sweat... He certainly doesn't work up any drama.
18853|1|It's abundantly clear that Lee, in conjunction with fight choreographer Yuen Wo-Ping (famed for The Matrix), has brought to these standard tropes his own elevating, near-feline sensibilities.
675|1|Writer-director Sautet's great achievement is to introduce a world of undefinable impulses; the two actors' great achievement is to step into that world and experience them.
1299|1|Planet is very entertaining.
12997|0|Could've spared me the introduction
37453|0|Mariah Carey should have taken an acting class from Marky Mark Wahlberg. The first lesson: start small.
34495|1|The real key to the film is the commanding Michael Shannon.
81821|0|Vapid, lengthy, and mostly lifeless -- kind of like the desert it's named for.
56649|1|A candy-colored fusion of Dahl, Dr. Seuss and the director's own mischeviousness
8296|1|It stands as an extraordinary technically achievement, if nothing else.
80415|0|I myself growled and whimpered like an abused canine after a couple of hours of this sub-Lassie silliness, though the film threw me the occasional choc-drop in the form of a gag.
17974|1|For those of us who miss Dave Attell's Insomniac TV show, it's fun to merely watch, once again, a dingy comedian stumble bleary-eyed around various cities with a cameraman in tow.
8381|0|The logic of the next scene is never as important to Harlin as the size of the next explosive charge.
33474|1|Swofford has said he doesn't mind the movie's alterations, but the real issue is how it dulls the intimacy and idiosyncrasy of his voice, which was the book's compass.
27205|1|The film exhorts a sense of nostalgia for the stressful trials of youth.
44151|0|Gruesome, nasty and mean-spirited, with emphasis on gory, gooey special effects.
5589|0|Kudos to you if you can figure out what in god's name that ending is supposed to indicate, because I'm lost at this time...
9592|0|Unreal, politically dumb premise with Howell in blackface .
24593|1|Lee Evans steals every scene he's in.
65276|0|I'm tempted to go ahead and explain just exactly how transparent -- and implausible -- this mystery is. But then I don't want to spoil it for people who are even worse than I am at this sort of thing. People like Forrest Gump.
39750|1|Girl with the Pearl Earring is about the liberating and inspiring experience of being seen.
426|0|Atmospheric, early Universal horror starring Otto Kruger, Gloria Holden.
5356|1|"Little gem of a film complements Duvall's later film ""The Apostle"""
15495|1|...a harmless little romance that's elevated slightly by the charisma of its two stars...
8014|1|A rigorous and bracingly charming movie about moviemaking.
26602|1|Sleeper is terrific.
6664|0|The kind of high-camp, low-cohesiveness movie that inspires snippy reviews, and sarcasm about the fact that it earned a best foreign film Oscar nomination.
46226|1|It's everything a road picture is supposed to be, a life-changing personal journey, a quest, a bit old-fashioned and a hoot.
1086|0|While not without its funny moments, this labored sequel ups the nudity and gross-out factor while diminishing the sweetness and evident camaraderie of its appealing leads.
17046|1|Hercules fires off mythology in-jokes and pop culture references at a speed that would dizzy the Animaniacs.
66563|1|an enthralling, if sometimes inadvertently cheesy adventure yarn, an intriguing window into the fears and anxieties of the early Reagan years, and a film-lover's cavalcade of genre mash-up
66036|0|It's too bad that the false sense of high heel empowerment never registers as soundly as our resident money-styling maidens look to achieve in this beleaguered City.
10380|1|[Author! Author! is] a simple story featuring people that we're rooting for all the way through.
68844|1|Persists as one of the great fables of young adult cinema not merely because it's very skilled at what it does, but because it weaves that magic into the minds and hearts of kids that serve as identifiable facets of our universal journey towards maturity.
9182|1|Ingmar Bergman's provocative existential drama was the first to garner him great international attention.
31471|1|It's a quintessential girl's coming-of-age story, and writer/director Robert Towne saw that Hemingway's uncanny ability to play both impressionable and stubborn, ingenuous and ambitious, naive and wise, was perfectly suited to this drama.
71242|1|Run to Chicken Run. This clay-animation comedy is the most entertaining animal story since Babe.
12169|0|If the movie weren't done in such deadly earnest, it might have made a great cult-classic, 'so-bad-it's-good' flick, but as it is, it's simply bad.
11209|0|Director Mike White is really good at creating an uneasy feeling in a normal setting. But the question remains, do you want him to?
25268|0|Too embarrassing for Robbins
16462|1|The result is a gripping movie that often makes you wish its director, Zinnemann, knew as much about American life as he does about the art of telling a story with a camera.
2306|1|One of Spielberg's best films, yet seldom shown.
45947|1|North by Northwest, Alfred Hitchcock's very own adrenalin-fuelled action blockbuster.
53937|0|The highly stylized result feels barren of both texture and imagination.
19300|0|Not terrible, but this MTV teen movie falls flat.
7425|1|With a film like Me and You and Everyone We Know there is much to talk about afterward, and half the fun is in its dissection.
58298|1|Carrie is one of the most heart-breaking and cringe-worthy high school dramas ever made, and that's before she even gets to her apocalyptic revenge.
61937|0|The characters are the only joke in Club Dread, and they're not enough.
59305|1|solid, entertaining biopic
4874|1|It's not Shakespeare, but it's certainly fun.
63322|0|Each earnest impulse blunts the edge of an already scattered satire and obscures the logic beneath it. And the laughs are buried in the same pile of disorderly conduct.
19499|1|One belly laughing sequence after another.
38646|1|For All Mankind is about what makes these men all the same...and, to some extent what makes us all the same: our infinitesimal smallness in the humbling vastness of the universe. [Blu-ray]
35706|1|A fresh, funny, and abrasive film about three high school seniors.
18782|1|John Malkovich has a blast, so will you!
31508|1|It's not a simple genre film, and some will find it complicated to digest for that reason, but if you're up for a bit of intelligent stimulation, this will reward
15258|1|Goldarned if the whole fool enterprise is not worth the attention of any moviegoer with a penchant for what one actor, commenting on another's Gabby Hayes imitation, calls 'authentic western gibberish.'
4784|1|Morbidly fascinating work, choreographed from within a vacuum devoid of feeling and retribution, and spearheaded by a director who must find some sadistic pleasure in being such an exacting provocateur.
59919|1|... a highly manipulative, utterly predictable and greatly entertaining film
10164|1|A highly entertaining look at these bizarre personalities and an insight into their obsession with Scrabble.
2116|1|An unexpectedly classy film. Not for kids.
13068|1|There is simply no other film which demonstrates so perfectly what it feels like to be young and in love.
67282|0|Dropping quietly into theaters like a sneak attack on brain cells and good taste, C.B. Harding's rickety vehicle for Blue Collar Comedy is among the first films to mine the endless War on Terror for laughs.
27817|1|Enjoyable as camp rather than as a manual for living, or even good filmmaking.
41159|0|This one got a little redundant about halfway through.
7498|1|Though not always entirely credible, Dead Calm is a nail-biting suspense pic [from the novel by Charles Williams] handsomely produced and inventively directed.
13379|1|A catalogue of second-best decisions
81258|1|Surreal and, yes, haunting.
36045|1|Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me reveals the side of this quiet American town that could never be shown on television.
48316|1|It goes without saying that Saraband doesn't make for light hearted viewing. But this is a powerful, emotional family drama that can happily rank with some of Bergman's best work.
40652|1|Martin Scorseses dream project finally explodes on the screen after years of planning and another year of delays.
7339|0|Henry Jaglom's lighthearted satire of Hollywood wheeler-dealers goes as far as the director is willing to bite...
4230|1|The acting is entirely unaffected. Every performance rings true, whether from an experienced actor or a neophyte.
9150|1|Ozu only has to train his camera on a face to uncover a sense of resignation, or longing, or loneliness, and the mood, if you allow it, becomes quite overwhelming.
39628|1|...a lovely and bittersweet fable about morality, the fleetingness of fame, drawing strength from the past and finding the inevitable beauty in the darkest of situations.
79042|1|A wonderful, fascinating documentary on the infamous German director, possibly the greatest female filmmaker in history.
44495|1|A stunning debut, and arguably one of the Coens' two best features, this Gothic noir introduced the wry, sardonic, and playful approach that would shape their future work, and launched the screen career of the brilliant Frances McDormand.
52152|1|Becomes a somber, sentimental and rather profound romantic fantasy that is more true to the spirit of the Golden Age of science-fiction writing than possibly any other movie of the '90s.
20592|1|Ainouz' script and style seem unwilling to explore below the surface. He embraces the story's physical details...without revealing much of his subject's soul.
67549|0|This is a star vehicle in extremis.
7893|1|Doesn't quite go far enough, instead settling for cheap gags and cheap thrills, but it tickles fairly well for a couple of hours of crashes and fireballs. [Blu-ray]
38830|1|Not even Hollywood could invent a romance more extraordinary than this one.
76836|1|Basically, James, GoldenEye wasn't bad. A bit long and not the sexiest or most thrilling Bond movie. But a Bond movie nonetheless, and far from an embarrassment like Moonraker.
43402|1|Director Sunu Gonera does a nice job with the swim meet scenes, and the cast of mostly unknown younger actors is extremely likable.
17945|1|A thoughtful romantic comedy with a snappy hook.
9181|1|The two leads are raw but completely intriguing, and Poetic Justice offers a slice of the urban story that we generally don't get to see.
50059|1|There's no doubting the deep love Caouette feels for his troubled mother, nor his achievement in forging such a rawly emotional film from his own traumatic experiences.
36323|0|A grotesquely uneven schlockfest with large doses of bad writing and bad acting amid the delicious moments.
38697|1|Better then you've heard. Paul William's songs are genius.
73574|0|OMG! It's The Passion of the Lohan!
7602|0|Suggests a sort of Judeo-Nubian alliance that would supposedly make uptight WASP's quake with fear. I think.
9840|1|Get on the Bus may well be the best film Spike Lee's made since Do the Right Thing.
7632|1|Lightning in a Bottle is at once deliberate and agile.
20792|0|What recommends Fame to whatever degree that it doesn't totally suck is that Parker's still content at this point in his career to not resolve every single storyline
54809|1|A gripping build up gives way to an incredibly dumb finish.
78767|1|Some of the images, such as one of a young boy staring at Von Sydow as he's fishing, will haunt you long afterwards.
40031|0|Many bad movies at least make an effort; this one is content to simply lay there, like a fat tick gorged on the blood of complacent moviegoers.
44859|0|BloodRayne is quite cheesy -- the costumes resemble something out of the cosplay closet, and the dialogue is often appalling.
15067|1|A loving celebration, and biting critique, of our pop culture-saturated times.
25334|1|There's quality here and that's a real good thing.
36969|1|A plea for cultural evolution that doesn't point fingers, instead only hoping that the next generations will wake up and take the sensible steps towards the future.
2543|0|At 83 minutes, it's tedious, pretentious, and just plain boring. I kept waiting for something to happen, but nothing does.
63496|1|Exhilarating but skin-deep summer fun. (You were expecting Shakespeare?)
38143|1|The emotion is impressively true for being so hot-blooded, and both leads are up to the task.
20503|1|Story isn't the point here, nor are complex characters, potent themes or arch conversations. The film exists as spectacle in its purest form.
11660|0|An oppressively long cinematic oddball.
18621|1|A beautifully mounted movie that's difficult to shake.
4615|0|Surprise: It's a soppy tearjerker, not a hot sex farce
6830|1|Notwithstanding its quintessentially indie need to develop character through quirk rather than, y'know, characterisation...the opening fifteen or twenty minutes are actually pretty great.
60532|0|Parents! Hire a bouncy castle. Put on clown paint and make balloon animals. You need not see this.
63164|0|A mediocre mishmash of female-bonding comedy, schmaltzy romance and blessedly brief horror about latter-day witchcraft!
2050|1|Cynical and raunchy comedy for adults only.
70711|0|A minor vampire thriller that's in need of a blood transfusion.
56427|0|A surprisingly timid and largely toothless action fantasy for kids.
35288|0|It's so sad that Phoenix went out not with a bang but with this whimper.
19477|0|No doubt about it, to divulge the plot would spoil the experience -- you'll be shocked to discover, and maybe even surprised to learn, just how lame the damn thing really is.
14511|1|The outstanding ensemble cast goes a long way toward redeeming things.
12308|1|As you might expect, coming from indie godfather John Cassavetes, 1977's Opening Night is something else, a weird, raw, ragged portrait of an actress on the verge of a
40364|1|Each of [Meshkini's] stories has the timeless quality of a fable, and each has wisdom and a quiet, stoic sense of defiance in the face of patriarchal tradition.
16331|1|This is a film about insufficiency on so many levels, a film not of hipster indifference, but of a certain effete inability to react.
34910|1|A masterful telling of star crossed love, with all the complications of any affair. Neither gratuitous nor shying away from the hidden pasion, Lee crafts a sublte and quite beautful film.
32724|1|Chaplin at his most melancholy. Not his best work, but the short time he and Keaton are on stage together is priceless.
10311|0|Get rid of Arquette and this might have been a real movie.
80770|0|A humourless trudge through haunted house cliches, it's unlikely to scare anyone old enough to get past the box office.
68796|0|Diamonds can be proud of its achievement as the ultimate primer on elderly embarrassments and the best ways to exploit them.
64402|1|Clearly influenced by slashers such as The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and The Last House On The Left, there's a decent sense of claustrophobia in the first hour.
11951|1|Silkwood is the story of an ordinary woman, hard-working and passionate, funny and screwed-up, who made those people mad simply because she told the truth as she saw it and did what she thought was right.
6604|1|You'll leave the theater somewhat emotionally spent -- feeling like you've been tackled by a 220-pound linebacker -- but it's worth the ride. One of the best sports movies ever.
5057|1|Just when you thought you had seen the best movie there is about a historic seagoing vessel, along comes Amistad.
52016|1|Like Fuller, Kelly believes in the direct approach, and a good slap can get quick results.
30853|1|In the extraordinary film Wisconsin Death Trip we see how much we have in common with our forebears.
45465|1|This film will hit a huge chord with those who weren't in diapers in the 70's, but people who missed the era should find penty to enjoy as well.
75366|1|Pee-wee Herman voices the main robot. If that ain't enough said, you're hopeless.
73317|0|There may be a subtle bone somewhere in Spike Lee, but it would take a team of skilled surgeons to find it.
36147|1|A masterful supernatural thriller, using simple techniques to remarkable effect.

50513|1|Plowright, who has made something of a specialty of breathing life into stereotypically written older women for the past 20 years, makes the most of a rare opportunity to play someone still open to the surprises the world can bring.
4313|1|Million Dollar Baby, above all else, feels like a work that comes out of years of living, and years of experience with people, and knowing what works and what doesn't. It also comes from a director who is still able to be touched when two people connect.

16985|0|It's a feature best viewed on mute. Or not at all.
1723|1|It's not great, but it occasionally flirts with greatness. It's not bad, but it can be dull and repetitive. It's too smart to be mediocre.
4400|0|Everywhere you look in Beloved are signs of Demme's decay as a director -- the inattention to performances, the grindingly slow pacing, the sloppy, at times incoherent, story line and the straining grandiloquence of the tone.
56143|0|A culture-clash comedy that's less a movie than an overproduced, four-times-too-long sitcom.

15195|0|If rampant misogyny and racism sound like a laugh riot, by all means see National Security, a 'comedy' so aggressively unpleasant that it's worthy of squirms.
67660|1|Made when Oliver Stone still had cred and Cruise wasn't a laughing stock. A fine movie.
76736|0|Writer-director Courtney Solomon manages to cast a modern spin on the story, but it is one that could be regarded as the least imaginative explanation possible.
1127|1|Shelton only achieves the intensity he's looking for at one point, when the riots finally break out and Perry has to drive through crowds of looters.
10499|1|Million Dollar Baby is as close to an anti-Rocky as a sports picture ever came, but even when following familiar paths, it stakes out its own distinctively harsh territory.
78245|1|The surprises Perelman has for you along the way will blow your mind and have you talking hours after you leave the theater.

54548|1|Despite cartoonish characters, over-the-top hijinks, and occasional lapses of bad taste, any movie that leaves you laughing up the aisle, has to remain well-recommended.
16777|0|Watching this movie is like watching Godfrey Cambridge's racial switcheroo in 1970's Watermelon Man -- without the laughs.
14994|0|For a vampire movie with such an exciting concept, Bloodlust is low on tension and chills.
55327|1|It does cast Helena Bonham Carter against type as a devoted mother and housewife, and, for soccer nuts, integrate pristine footage from the '66 Cup.

17930|1|The actors in Unknown Pleasures generate sympathy from their sullen good looks as much as any acting ability.
46210|1|The hallmarks of a true collaboration between the director and his actors are everywhere, and their performances are what raise the film above any of its shortcomings.
62999|0|Built upon a powerful but gimmicky end, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas would make a fine short. As a full-length feature, though, the pajamas wear thin quickly.
49452|1|The Empire strikes back in loutish, fun musical comedy.
76152|0|Yes, Bang Rajan introduces Westerners to a slice of history worth noting, but its stirring lesson is told in a way that's too long, too brutal, and too clunky to recommend enthusiastically.
17430|1|The Bad and the Beautiful took home a quintet of Oscars from 1953's ceremony and in its title alone we have possibly the greatest ever description of Hollywood.
55733|0|The screenplay stretches the viewer's credulity far beyond the breaking point, asking us to accept dozens of absurd contrivances and coincidences.
20979|1|A little slow, but overall a good film.
77384|0|Quite possibly the least essential movie ever made. A call to arming the elderly.
12751|1|The Coens' unconventional editing techniques convey a sense of setting and urgency few filmmakers could accomplish (or even would brave trying).
9277|1|Fried Green Tomatoes is an engaging if sentimental tale, charmingly handled by producer-turned-director Jon Avnet and flawlessly acted by its four female stars.

77696|1|Director Jay Roach of the Austin Powers films keeps the pace brisk, and the script by Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg ably piles the pratfalls ludicrously high.
74731|1|I'm glad I didn't pay full price to see this, but it is not a bad way to pass some time in a bargain theater or a cheap movie rental.
60289|1|It's nice to see Mira Sorvino who has sort of wobbled about since winning the Oscar about ten years ago she is very good in this film.
17843|1|One of Launder and Gilliat's most likeable films.
40881|1|The script by John Guare deserves an award - witty and very bright.
6338|1|The spirit of Agatha Christie hovers over 'Mindhunters,' a suspenseful mystery with plenty of suspects to keep viewers guessing about the identity of a serial killer.
55836|0|Woody Allen's Take the Money and Run has some very funny moments, and you'll laugh a lot, but in the last analysis it isn't a very funny movie.
12755|1|It remains the most subtly romantic and highly atmospheric rendition of Bram Stoker's tale about the Transylvanian count, with Browning orchestrating the opening scenes to macabre perfection.

22803|0|Except for Jimmy ... these are not very interesting folks and, at first, it's hard to keep them all straight or even care.
56696|1|Starting Out in the Evening is thrilling in a way that a movie larded with car chases and explosions can seldom be, because of the way it deals with that basic building block of civilization, the creative process.
4438|1|So long, Freddy, it's been good to know you.
16691|0|Special effects lap the field, while the plot is in the pits.

45274|1|Wesley Snipes has the chops to play Blade, and turns the character in to a vampire hunting John Shaft.
21550|0|With its clotted script, art direction that's all splash and no style, and dialogue that's too nakedly calculated to facilitate identification), this tedious and confused movie points several characters in obvious directions.
36627|1|One of the most complicated and radical films even Bergman ever made.
80506|0|The key word here is 'whore,' not 'horror.' As in 'too bad Polanski's become one' ... and such an ineffective one, to boot.
61290|1|"The idea of actors being mistaken for their roles was used in ""The Three Amigos,"" but ""Galaxy Quest"" mines the comic potential better."
61386|1|...the film is so well made, the acting so good, the period so well captured, and the photography so captivating that it's hard not to like it.
24109|0|What kind of food is Calista Flockhart feeding - or, rather, not feeding - Harrison Ford over there?

5391|1|Passionate tale of lost and regained love.
50665|0|Never succeeds in recreating the classics.
36911|1|This take on Vietnam War doesn't break new thematic ground but it's Schumacher's best film since the 1993 Falling Down, and it showcases the talents of newcomer Colin Farrell, who has everything that it takes to become a major Hollywood star

24580|1|This is a beguiling film in more ways than one.
52519|1|No quips. No smirks. No innuendoes. Just raw, exposed nerves. The traits for which Dalton gets dinged are those looking past the character's admittedly alluring surface pleasures. Women aren't the only things that keep 007 awake at night, you know.
15222|0|Utterly disposable.
22884|1|Violent but thrilling first of the Bourne action trilogy.
19844|1|Fun, if not cookie-cutter, Agatha Christie-based flick w/Peter Ustinov fine as Det. Hercule Poirot.
3075|1|"From first scene to the unforgettable final sting, ""Raising Cain"" is hypnotic in its richly devised spell, starkly realistic fears invaded by haunting spurts of dream logic."
14974|1|Though upsetting, the film remains an eye-opening eyewitness report on the counterculture experience in its decline.
16466|1|Mel's sheepish grins, charming buffoonery and flashes of wit carry the picture to such an extent that we are generously forgiving towards the skimpy dividend that is the return for our investment.

3364|1|It's a pleasure to welcome The Crow -- a bird of a very different feather.
14303|1|It's as much a wonder of suspense as it is a catalogue of the director's themes and an allegory for his own art of enticement-and for the erotic pitfalls of his m√©tier.

25638|0|[Noyce is] a masterful manipulator, but eventually there is no more wind in these sails, not even enough to riffle a jib, as the story and Rae's character wear thin.
57151|0|Lazy, smug and completely self-satisfied, this half-hearted sequel to Agent Cody Banks swaps Sean Connery suavity for Roger Moore stupidity.
17600|1|"The ""fascist"" staging could have been hackneyed, but Loncraine carries it off superbly as the showcase for action-thriller noir."
867|1|The secret to the film's modest success can be summed up in five words: Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo.

19898|1|Refreshing and fun.
7705|0|Lacking gravitas, MacDowell is a placeholder for grief, and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel. Leave these Flowers unpicked -- they're dead on the vine.
7589|1|The film's bleak but powerful ending is a wake-up call to Britain and a measure of the pessimism of Loach, one of its most trenchant critics. I fear things must be really bad over there.
68466|0|The movie doesn't feel authentic, it's relationships are drawn in erratic, TV movie-like strokes.

10958|0|Star Trek: Generations suffers from the feeling that it is only a bigger budgeted episode of the television show, one that fails to use the full potential of the cinematic medium.
7328|0|Little more than an occasionally amusing, often maddening rip-off of old Woody Allen multirelationship films.
56652|1|The end is clear from the start, but it's rather amusing to watch nonetheless, backed by a strong, eclectic cast.
16406|1|Brooks's spare and reverberant film ... stands back from the actors and just lets them be with each other.
15341|0|Boring in the extreme, lurching along in search of diversion before fitfully delivering what the customers presumably paid to see.

68573|1|A great film of uncommon truth.
10009|1|In a film that opens with the sight of a waving American flag, subtlety may not be foremost on anyone's mind. But Mr. Ford's wary intelligence does wonders for a potentially one-dimensional character.
33603|1|Delightful in places, the surreal stunts are lovingly crafted. As a seaworthy film, though, Fiona's folly is more pratfall than plot.

24193|0|Part of the problem seems to have been that Van Peebles had too much to say.
62766|0|America Ferrera projects such star power here that I felt cheated when the camera moved to other characters. The rest of the film seemed to drag for me.

26764|1|The Coens do an efficient job of stamping their signature grotesquerie on sumptuous Beverly Hills and Las Vegas settings and ladling on gallows humor and malice, sometimes with the verve of early Robert Zemeckis.
4451|1|Considerably less satisfying than the original Rocky, but head and shoulders above the later installments.
46993|1|Although not a slam-dunk, it's a satisfying lay-up.
25056|1|There is little rhyme or reason to most of the action, but it's all highly palatable.
74454|1|None of his actors stand out, but that's less of a problem here than it would be in another film: Characterization matters less than atmosphere.

45011|0|There isn't a single surprise, but there is a lot of hokey (and mostly too loud) music, along with tired visuals (parachuting over a snow-clad angel statue is one) and stuff blowing up.
51615|1|An exuberant comedy of manners drunk on its own outlandish melodrama.
34377|1|A subtle, thoughtful movie.
7062|1|Hitchcock would be proud of this trainbound suspense thriller with Woody Harrelson playing against type. A first-rate story, great action and great direction. Take the trip!
18700|1|THX 1138 shows that Lucas was once interested in letting actors act, and in letting the audience think for themselves. It reveals just how much his technological toys have crippled him as a storyteller.
49070|0|Looking terrified and screaming is really all that's required in David Self's inane script.
52974|0|The story goes back and forth into the future and then the past and is very disturbing. This is an interesting premise but a little too crazy for me.
27887|0|Corny dialogue and a contrived plot.

24176|1|Funny, memorable, but ultimately a little too dark to savor.
5015|1|The film is not only an account of the moral slippage of one man but the record of a far larger, seemingly uncontrollable escalation.
51177|1|There isn't a character in the large, excellent cast that doesn't emerge with depth and precision.
55615|0|On the whole, the movie bogs down in reverence for Selena and her family; I lost count of the speeches about believing in yourself and making dreams come true.
34007|1|A film of Artaudian cruelty, and a boundary-breaker in the cinema's exploration of its own erotic and artisanal id.
14299|1|One of the most charming of all Disney features... like anyone else, when I see it I am swiftly and inexorably carried back to childhood, in accordance with the drippy clich√©s.

1635|1|Though made with an eye for the Bicentennial, this biopic of folk singer and union organizer Woody Guthrie didn't make any attempt to speak to contemporary viewers, which might explain its box-office failure.
13750|0|Like all of Murphy's recent films, there's also a sweet-if-predictable heart beating beneath the discount jokes.
3193|0|The movie's surplus of male-fraternizing never conveys that these Americans are under imminent danger and stress.
80782|1|My Brother Is an Only Child is a buoyant, handsomely crafted film.
55005|1|Its artful ambiguities are immersive. Check in.
74430|0|Awkward and unamusing and ridiculous in the bad way.
12517|1|David Spade and Chris Farley made a fine comedic team.
13154|0|Lots of familiar faces are brought in to liven things up. But it's all rather diluted, as though the ice has melted in the dry martini.
32942|0|If Mr Baseball were a Major League team, it would be the Chicago Cubs; friendly, occasionally successful, but never likely to amount to much more than a .500 season.
78142|1|This melodramatic fable of emotional extremes is sharp and precise-nowhere more than in Fassbinder's attention to the price of domestic comforts and industrial necessities.
19961|1|The movie offers a loving but strikingly tempered assessment of family and town life that one seldom finds in today's raucous family films.
72645|0|The home-run performances of Cube and Epps are handicapped by inept and illogical action sequences.
54608|1|Quite simply it's one of the most entertaining, most intelligent and most thoroughly satisfying commercial American films in a very long time.
14442|0|Consistently throughout the film, Stickler skates right over the crux of the matter.

67464|1|Chickens are inherently funny, like nature's idea of a very practical joke. Park and Lord have just improved the old rubber chicken gag, making it movable, turning it into something closer to who we are and what we know as humans.
10981|1|Admirably portrays the different seasons in the long marriage of a Midwestern couple.
54774|1|By turns moving and creepy -- and very sexual -- it's one of Polanski's darkest and deepest works, yet strangely one of his least celebrated.
75860|1|A visionary tale of a fragile civilizing impulse crushed by family loyalty and a lust for revenge in the vast Outback of the late 19th century.
43479|1|A great horror anthology that thankfully restores my faith in the anthology gimmick that Hollywood completely diminished years ago...
1702|0|Despite its rock 'n' roll trappings, The Banger Sisters is like an After-School Special with better actors and more swearing.
13233|1|One of those hand-made movies that sneaks into festivals and wins friends.
18284|0|It's never as funny as we'd like, and the characters seem too cartoony to hook us.
3711|1|Perhaps not the greatest of the screwball comedies, but Frank Capra's It Happened One Night is one of the racier.

40755|1|If you're a fan of crime flicks, Viggo Mortensen or director David Cronenberg, this movie is sure to give you what you want.
41792|0|Stone gives us some truly stirring visuals, music that soars and charges more often than not, and, um, performances that . . . Well, um, okay, about those performances . . .

61337|0|Creepy thriller not for faint of heart.
80596|1|This sounds like prime fodder for a fast-paced thriller, but the movie is actually something more special: a tender-hearted rumination on the loss of innocence among children.
16402|1|A thinly veiled look at different aspects of Chinese life clashing with each other.
412|0|You'd think a movie with Bob Hoskins, Michael Caine, Helen Mirren and Tom Courtenay couldn't be all bad, but you'd be wrong.

36050|0|Vincent Price was an actor who never gave anything than his best possible performance at any given time.
10960|0|Lake is a rather chilly and distinctly unpersuasive presence.
62096|0|There are several moments of high, unheralded humor -- although whenever you find yourself laughing, you have to ask yourself if you aren't merely grateful that anything is happening at all.
1798|1|A wonderful cinematic experience.
17913|1|One of Foster's earliest, but no less impressive, turns
45810|1|Working within the constraints of a big studio film has brought out Gilliam's best: he's become a true storyteller and a wonderful director of actors. This time he delights not only the eye but the soul.
36267|1|Awkwardly sentimental but nevertheless sharply spry in song and sass, Lee's acid-tongued Soul Men certainly have something to sing about.
53349|0|There are ticklish moments, but no real laughs.
8700|1|Cary Grant, one of cinema's greatest actors, gives maybe his finest performance here. (It's hard to say, there are dozens.)
81947|1|Screwball Annie and hardball Crash aren't playing the same game, which is Shelton's conceit as well as a possible screen-writing miscalculation.
58557|1|What could have become just another cautionary fable is allowed to play out as a clever, charming tale %u2013 as pleasantly in its own way as its self-dramatizing characters.
44933|1|A lengthy, leisurely paced film.
76497|1|Haunted Ouija board picture--better than average performances help
5527|1|Writer-director Mike Cahill explores Charlie's foolishness with funny-sad fondness.
58578|0|Too often those behind the slick 3-D animation spectacles aimed at children imbue them with too much adult humor.
13367|1|A charmingly sloppy affair [full of] banter and the free-wheeling spirit of old Hollywood romances... a sun-drenched cinematic field trip.
44405|1|Indeed, the film never veers into arch territory, possessing such affection for its characters that not one of them, not even Sarah Marshall, comes off as the bad guy.
3995|1|Offers Americans the ultimate fantasy vacation. It's a beautiful, sunny, fresh air trip to Europe without the jet lag, language problems, money problems, or any other trivialities.
37545|0|If you like your burger well-done, you're in for a disappointment.
39748|1|This drippy material was generally not the kind of stuff that suited Hawks, but he made the best of it with the film's spirited barroom brawls and a delightful scene in which McCrea and Farmer pull taffy together.
497|0|Ponderous and superficial, and no art deco fashions or tasteful drawing rooms can compensate for it.
57712|1|An intelligent science fiction thriller that also happens to be a solid father/son movie. It's entertainment aimed at the adult, not teen, audience and squarely hits the mark. Forgive the Hollywood ending.
76994|0|A ridiculous film, but I guess I had fun watching it.
4483|1|"Designed neither to warm your heart nor shelter you in the comfort of liberal guilt, the movie does what so many style-conscious, ""subjective"" documentaries have long forgotten how to do. It shows you a world, and stays the hell out of it."
33011|0|If Kassovitz really believed he had a classic in the making, why didn't he take a stand and nix the casting of Diesel while he had the chance?
42583|0|While it has its up points, it's clunky, tedious, and is a basic retread of material from Deodato's horror flick...
6784|1|Watching the film, you think maybe you know where it's headed. Or maybe not. Not every ceremony ends in the way we anticipate.
76144|0|Ambiguity [in this film] is the unwitting product of outrageous disorganization, wild ambivalence, and an unerring instinct for, well, error.

67895|1|It's a sleek, muscular thriller played by a terrific ensemble cast...
7206|1|An evocative exercise in alienation and existential dread, Herzog masterfully tackles one of the greatest gothic stories ever with Nosferatu the Vampyre with the unforgettable (as always) Klaus Kinski as the titular blood-sucker.
13845|0|Neither spooky nor otherworldly.
73931|0|Another sequel that falls short of the original mark.
74041|1|A fairly rousing example of the genre.
5203|1|Good writing by Robert Towne and a host of strong supporting performances complement the on-the-track visuals of director Tony Scott in giving us a sense of the leap of faith that is required by drivers at this level.
71893|0|surreally disjointed
79966|1|The intelligently adapted screenplay retains all the essence of the novel.
50726|1|There isn't a contemporary film actor more crafty than Val Kilmer -- or one who reveals less of his true self. That's why Kilmer is so perfectly cast as Simon Templar, the master thief and elusive disguise artist of The Saint.
33294|0|Convenient bimbo stereotypes, bolstered and magnified.
53649|1|My rowdy audience at Do The Right Thing did not cheer the riot, nor did one break out at the end. Like me, they left having seen a reflection of their own lives onscreen.
37520|1|A solid sci-fi movie, suffering only from a terrible marketing campaign.
41218|1|The picture plays out with the robust character of the old Flash Gordon movies.
12821|1|A succinct effort to explore how our relationships force us to re-evaluate what we want out of life at the most inopportune and unexpected of times.
59361|0|House of the Dead is a very entertaining film, but only because it's made in a such inept and unprofessional way that it's almost impossible to believe that it was shown in cinemas. [Full review in Spanish]
7465|1|Now king of the spaghetti slasher, Argento made his directorial debut with this tightly constructed thriller.
6340|1|An inventive and energetic raggedy thing, made with a wide screen chutzpah rare in British film, and held together by a committed charismatic lead couple.
18516|0|Sure, the movie opens up the racial problems of everyday life in New York, but it also has a very forgiving tone to what one could label as the oppressed.
81104|0|...offers more pleasure as a jigsaw puzzle than it does as a movie.
66599|0|Mellow -- nay, snoozy -- atmospherics trump actual scares, and it makes almost zero sense.
31081|1|Wonderful, perceptive, and original Australian film about the magic and anguish of adolescence.
53289|1|Looking For Comedy in the Muslim World is full of Albert Brooks' trademark jokes and absurd scenarios.
19252|1|Serling observed that for as lovely as Bradbury was to read, his prose proved nearly impossible to say.
23270|1|A highly charged, emotionally exhausting indictment of war and the inhumanity of the Nazis, set in Byelorussia during the 1943 Nazi invasion.
10684|1|Pretty good as far as adaptations of John Grisham novels go.
68842|1|...a purely conventional story, but it unfolds in unique and innovative ways, with particularly good turns from its cast, all of which make it a worthwhile watch.
47573|0|Red flags (not checkered) abound in the banal script, silly dialogue, and the age-defying stretch marks on the face of Burt Reynold.
73856|1|Full of lush, fluid cinematography and evocative music, Water is an important look at a social injustice, and Mehta's most accomplished film yet.
44791|0|Ned Kelly suggests that not only do you not need anything of interest to watch, but you don't even need to see it at all.
75122|1|Cute, but sends iffy messages to Tisdale fans.
57141|0|...poignancy doesn't interfere with director Anderson's primary objective, which is to show people shooting each other and blowing stuff up.
30025|1|The banter, jealousy and cattiness among these charming stereotypes of the Anglo-American lifestyle sweepstakes makes much of this engaging film a winner.
43248|1|It's a good family movie.
60477|1|One of the best Shakespearean film adaptations out there.
16697|0|White Noise is little more than an old-fashioned ghost story with a newfangled twist.
10108|1|Most movies are lucky to have one idea rattling around inside. The unusually resonant Truman positively vibrates with themes.
55627|1|John Boorman's magnificent and magical Excalibur is, to my mind, the greatest and the richest of screen incarnation of the oft-told tale.
67571|1|What's infectious about Groove is the friendly, almost innocent way that its brat pack of digital-age bohemians seek liberation in a world where there is nothing left to rebel against.
31326|0|A little more energy would have done the film a world of good.
9622|0|A filming-by-numbers mix of small-town nostalgia, soapy family drama and high-tech sfx, this Dreary Android Runaway Yarn Lags way behind the Spielberg thoroughbreds it tries so hard to ape.
29631|1|The beautiful, elegant swordfights are filmed clearly and poetically, and even the down-time between battles doesn't drag too badly.
8275|1|Pedestrian Disney cartoon w/nice Vincent Price voice-over.
19179|1|unarguably Pfeiffer's showcase: She's in almost every scene and she turns in captivating work under the direction of Robert Zemeckis, a filmmaker who knows how to show his audience a very good time.
17585|1|The remake is so faithful to the first film that some of the snap and crackle disappears if you know the plot. It's like watching The Sixth Sense for a second time.
49468|0|For the most part this film is not particularly funny or entertaining. The plot is, of course, predictable.
12264|1|The stylish, cartoon-like opening credits reminded me of the snazzy beginnings of the Peter Sellers-Pink Panther movies.
27533|1|Consider it Wong lite.
6934|1|It's good to have friends on the inside, you know?
9483|0|The main problem with the film is that it seems to be missing a sequence where we see Kat and Nick actually falling for each other - the script pretty much expects us to take it for granted just because they're the leads.
64104|1|A movie that seems the essence of a trivial romantic comedy for its first half, then grows up and gets serious about life.
18213|1|If Hannibal Rising catches fire, it may spark a new literary trend with Hollywood aspirations--i.e., when old monsters were kids
63144|1|Pleasantly regressive big monster flick.
21878|0|The performances are oddly muted, as if the screenplay refuses to allow a fine cast full rein. But those who loved the book can be assured that it has been translated faithfully enough to the screen.
50595|1|Still Arteta's best film, with odd touches of magic realism and some great nude scenes by Kandeyce Jordan.
60933|1|Live and Let Die has been especially well photographed and edited, and it makes clever and extensive use of its good title song, by Paul and Linda McCartney.
60466|0|True to Walt's original vision for Walt Disney pictures...you can taste the corniness.
80013|1|Charming.
17852|1|Sexual orientation is moot in first-time feature director Jim Fall's breezy, single-day-spanning romantic comedy.
48951|1|It's perfectly, elegantly reticent about its subject matter, as suits both the theme and the tradition of film noir (a type of filmmaking that thrives on unstated motives).
25340|1|Fun typical Seagal
34886|1|Another actor may have made 1408 seem as thin and fake as an episode of Tales from the Crypt, but Cusack lends it that badly needed extra milligram of conviction.
50770|1|Bresson's masterpiece is still a pinnacle in French cinema.
60474|0|Director Matthew O'Callaghan supplies a bright, cheerful look that will please small kids, but parents hardly need rush them to the theater; the video will do just as well.
9700|0|A Western for people that hate Westerns.
57796|1|The film is interesting, sexy and at times silly.
48311|1|This is not the future of films, but it is a future, especially for the action genre.
11801|1|There's an agreeable charm to this hokum that overrides much of the staginess and the unconvincing fairy-tale story.
59265|1|As in most of his Python parts... Cleese's character is an extended riff on the concept of pomposity. But Archie is more leavened with humanity than any of his other roles.
107|0|Its heart is in the right place, but this sweet drama just doesn't build enough true drama from its slender premise. That said, it's not bad enough to merit the kind of stealth release its studio has imposed on it.
3462|0|The word 'innocuous' was created for movies like this, both in the sense of being harmless, and in the sense of being unlikely to inspire any strong feelings.
2609|1|Faith takes a hip, raised-eyebrow beating in this biting yet surprisingly earnest dark comedy.
52771|1|This downbeat but fervent pic goes much further than the accepted war masterpieces in detailing humanity in crisis, and the spark left in one man. Production one of the most searing comments on war yet made.
24859|1|This is a Bond movie, and everything comes back to him and the actor who plays him. The filmmakers took a big gamble on Daniel Craig and on a script that updates everything. This time, the gamble paid off.
63569|1|Hard-R Farrelly bros. remake offers crude laughs.
5154|1|Thumbs up, without question. Unfortunately, Training Day could have been so much more than it is.
74338|1|The outstanding set pieces give the viewer an idea of the job pressures, its perks, pitfalls and how the news is in the long run compromised.
19380|1|Lumet orchestrates the machinations with the confidence of a master, but even he cannot quite manage to sustain the interest for the protracted arguments to run their course.
35461|1|Hawks directs the film with his typical assurance and seeming lack of fuss, letting scenes play out in long takes, and framing the action against vistas that often dwarf the actors.
70755|0|Martin Scorsese makes pictures about the kinds of people you wouldn't want to know.
15984|1|The film is likely to scare the daylights out of most of its audiences.
7264|1|If you're a fan of Woody Allen, or jazz music, this film a must-see.
62410|0|Does Alien vs. Predator: Requiem spell the end of the dual-monster franchise? Let's hope so
35780|1|Packed with cringe-worthy moments from beginning to end, Jay Roach's comedy is for anyone who has ever endured a weekend in the company of potential in-laws.
49486|0|A mixed bag of hit-and-miss jokes.
49979|1|I was on the edge of my seat most of the time.
3203|0|You'll be lucky if you survive this dumb movie.
7171|0|Attempts at quirky humor fall flat and the film settles into a fairly conventional action yarn.
46221|0|I don't know if the movie follows the book closely, but if it does, you kind of have to wonder how Leroy or Albert or whoever it was made such a splash in the first place.
28077|0|Uneven but also unflaggingly lively.
14990|0|None of these characters are the least bit likeable, and that's the fault of David Ayer, who structures the film as a series of mostly disconnected episodes with a single theme:
63017|1|Empire Records is little more than a poor man's Clerks, but an entertaining one.
52312|1|Amusing little cult comedy
41387|0|Having died in Daredevil, Elektra has returned without a vengeance to bore us all to death.
35072|0|Hosseini's over-done melodrama that doesn't so much open our eyes to Afghanistan as reinforce everything negative we've already suspected.
74784|0|Witherspoon is not immune to the bland and processed feel to this rote romantic comedy.
15364|0|As always, it takes an outsider--normally a dying woman or magical African-American --to convince the workaholic white guy he should spend more time with his family.
34696|0|Call me a cynic, there's only so much bitten back lovey-dovey looks I can take before wishing Jay and Silent Bob would show up and start cracking obnoxious jokes.
49780|0|Itresembles a film made up on the fly. The cast, too, are strictly cut from comic books. Don't expect any unconventional endings either.
18824|1|If you thought the battle scenes in... Saving Private Ryan were tough going, the final 20 minutes of Children of Men will not only shake you, they'll have you revising your expectations about just how realistic cinematic portrayals of combat can get.
39500|0|A numbingly reliable tick-tock of expository set pieces alternating with vast CGI-aided battle scenes.
77242|1|Brilliant direction.
34966|1|For a certain kind of moviegoer, Birth will provide allusive ancillary thrills...
4199|0|...plays like your neighbors' two-hour vacation slideshow that they insist on showing every time you come over.
1562|1|The comedy has the slow burn of a richly nuanced and non-judgmental character study.
8028|1|This futuristic comedy depends on your opinion of Stallone and his unapologetic popcorn-pleasing action no-brainers. To be fair, this one is one of his better ones.
44320|1|Serves as a moving reminder that there are people out there who walk the walk and serve as examples of the humanity we all should be exhibiting in our own lives.
79786|1|Perhaps the greatest and most revolutionary of Bresson's films, Balthazar is a difficult but transcendently rewarding experience, never to be missed.
23486|1|This stylishly elegant neo-noir, an impressive feature debut, reflects the directors' interest in issues of memory, identity, and racial biases and their background in art history.
44953|1|Epic romantic comedy that I believe every Irishman must have seen at least once.
6376|1|For all we know, it's just a big show, a put-on for our entertainment -- but what matters is that it's really quite convincing. You do want to believe this is Van Damme.
16285|1|The film became famous for its gross-out effects, but what makes it work is the foreboding atmosphere, rooted in the characters, which director William Friedkin creates right from the film's opening frames.
57389|1|Lohan's perkiness can seem a bit too practiced, but she's surrounded by pros who don't play down to the material.
42617|1|Actors Germano and Scamarcio turn in magnificent, multilayered acting jobs.
45868|1|Solondz knows his subject well, he is able to understand and convey what it is like to be brought up with self-hatred.
14338|1|Lightweight fun.
77971|1|This movie didn't really blow me away, but it was mildly enjoyable and should keep all of the fantasy fans happy
80550|1|Champlain's distorted perspective is compelling, despite Stone's sometimes flashy direction as he attempts to wrest cinematic qualities out of the essentially stagey material.
2987|0|Every now and again, a movie comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be. Frank McKlusky C.I. is that movie!
21150|0|Cheap special effects and nonexistent horror in a 'horror' flick make for one boring waste of celluloid.
11658|0|This 1967 effort is one of Bergman's most outlandish, with its pack of ghouls and its heavy suggestions of exhibitionism, necrophilia, and homosexuality -- a magnificent failure.
51878|1|As cinema, Zandalee is more intriguing for what it attempts to do than for what it actually achieves. But, as softcore eroticism, it's a better-than-average date movie for those hot video nights at home.
6274|1|With an eccentric charm that falters only in a few places, the movie makes a strong statement against conformity and the franchising of America by celebrating a cast of characters and a storyline that don't fit into a mold.
80746|1|engrossing enough to qualify as solid entertainment with a meaningful message
35450|1|Odd film about gossip sheets has many interesting touches and rich photography.

76217|0|It's young, it's hip, it's excruciating for anyone who has already survived adolescence.
68634|1|Topaz is not only most entertaining. It is, like so many Hitchcock films, a cautionary fable by one of the most moral cynics of our time.
79203|0|This loose remake of the Japanese hit film is disappointing in many respects, including the acting.
20333|1|It's impossible to say whether Dave will play as wonderfully over the decades as it does right now, but this smooth-as-silk comedy could not be more timely, or connect more hopefully with our current national consciousness.
36673|1|Truly terrifying journey into madness.
15271|1|[History Boys] is most potently about the love of teaching, and how the best teachers can help give meaning to existence; and if not meaning in the grand sense, at least an appreciation of what it means to be human.

81115|1|"If you can get past the fantastical aspects and harsh realities of ""The Isle"" you'll get a sock-you-in-the-eye flick that is a visual tour-de-force and a story that is unlike any you will likely see anywhere else."
29314|0|You can see the direction that the documentary started to take, but thanks to the sudden shift in content, it has an unfinished feeling.
77609|0|Celine Sciamma's quiet drama has moments of motionless yearning that contrast the intense emotions of its 15-year-old protagonists.
41723|0|It's clear that Queen Latifah is a proper, old school movie star - the camera loves her and her constantly upbeat screen persona is extremely likeable. It's just a shame that studios don't seem able to find a decent vehicle for her talents.
1897|1|While the film is over the top at times, Coach Carter has a big heart that doesn't shy away from challenging the American education system.
58560|1|The movie merits viewing consideration.
10343|0|One wonders whether the documentary format would have better served the material than this ill-focused drama. Since real-life family and observers chime in over the end credits, perhaps the filmmakers were thinking the same thing.

49082|1|Forget those Hollywood movies about extreme sports. MacDonald...has created a thrilling picture about a high-risk sport based on a true story.

33266|1|An almost textbook example of how to use a personal story to tell and illuminate a much larger one (are you listening, Oliver Stone?).
25884|1|The film's quality lies not just in its vivid portrayal of the bebop milieu, but also in its sensitive examination of the turbulent forces within an artist compelled to create on a nightly basis, despite personal consequences.
21646|1|Bow Wow makes an impressive film debut; parents and children will love Calv's plucky can-do attitude; and the action sequences are given a little more oomph due to the presence of real life basketball pros.
40272|1|An otherwise fine sports fantasy is dragged down by an overindulgence in sentimentality.
52763|0|I'll admit to chuckling a few times during the proceedings, but it's not worth losing 1 1/2 hours of one's life for a few minutes of amusement.
74697|1|Structurally all over the place but its infectious rhythms more than make up for narrative deficiencies.
41298|0|Simply put, Ray Johnson was neither good nor original. All that he did in his 'art' was done before and better by others. That the same can be said of his documentarian's film may be a small synchronicity, but that's all it is. What it is not is art.
46746|1|Probably the only film you'll see in a long time that affirms solitude as a perfect milieu for nurturing love.
71933|1|Hilarious live cartoon directed by Bogdanovich with sexy, silly turn by Streisand, and equally funny O'Neal and Kahn.
4795|1|One of Murphy's better outings, which admittedly isn't saying much.
2533|0|The plot provides a worthy lesson for kids, but it plays out like George Orwell's Animal Farm as retold by Barney. Kinda weird.
77301|0|The In Crowd isn't a movie, it's Gorgonzola, a crumbly summertime stinker veined with pop-cultural fungus.
6731|1|Eclectic, pacy and hard to categorise, it's part crime thriller, part love story, part fairytale, and part a gentle, generous examination of certain dying aspects of American culture.
15270|1|This has proved to be the most influential of all the early US films and it was the first to tell a definite story.

17847|0|The film is so insistently formulaic there is hardly a moment when you don't know exactly what's going to happen.
72350|0|For most of its running time it is so convincing -- and so sure of itself -- that it seems a particular waste when it goes dangerously wrong.
6400|1|Although it starts slowly, there are plenty of rewards in this well crafted family fantasy adventure, as it explores a world in which light bulbs form the sky and a powerful generator acts as its heartbeat.
6013|0|Add two stars-or even three-if you're as passionate about cheesy B-actor Campbell as he is about himself.
80947|1|It's the music that's great here, but the iconic hero is a kick to watch.
4793|1|Gary Gray's version is tauter, better made but insufficiently idiosyncratic to attract a cult following.
59418|0|Poorly lit, crooked camera angles (that didn't match one shot from the next) make the film nearly unwatchable.
9514|1|A series of terrific performances (led by the amazing Patricia Clarkson) make this unusual Thanksgiving comedy a feast for the mind.
1363|1|A flawless swashbuckler!
3741|1|Impressive performances, fascinating info-bytes and pertinent editorial, but in the end, it feels too much like an illustrated lecture.
35873|1|It's wonderfully provocative as only Fassbinder can be.
33796|0|Lackluster story only for kindergarteners.
67112|0|[Vardalos] never met a bad joke she doesn't love, never met a stereotype she won't exaggerate to a breaking point... and can't seem to get past a sitcom mentality.
15509|1|Hudson-Day sex farce (that is, in 1964) is fun relic today.
35934|1|Though a courtroom drama on the surface, the movie is really about the changing face of power in the military, and in all walks of life.
14203|0|Ultimately, there simply wasn't enough narrative development to justify a feature length film.
4302|1|Cuesta never gives us the satisfaction of fulfilling our expectations; instead he gives us a movie that we can ponder long the road takes its final turn.
40390|0|The production is amateurish and cheap-looking, but two decent performances are worth mentioning: Chris Klein as a sensitive jock and Alyson Hannigan as a nerdy flute player.
44873|1|It is like a buffet. You look at the cast and trailers and you just start drooling over all the options. But they just overdid it, stuffing you with filler, and the juicy part of the film didn't start until it was halfway through.
23736|1|A gutsy performance by Carly Schroeder is the high point of this likeable story about a girl with a dream
43898|0|The film's subtle racism is insidious, going to great lengths to enshrine the myth that the Civil War wasn't fought over slavery - an institution the film unabashedly romanticizes.
17076|1|Max doesn't 'humanize' Hitler, but makes him frighteningly plausible as a dud artist who took revenge by twisting history into a personal, obscene project.
10758|0|Constantly, the movie gives you the feeling of being drastically truncated, with hints of storylines that are never fully played out.
20730|0|In the history of active sabotage, this one's right up there.
23627|1|It's the fashion today for interpersonal dramas to go for bathos and high-stakes emotional conflict as characters cry out their darkest secrets to each other ... but director Cameron Crowe has taken a different tack.
28684|1|Starman contains the potential to be a very silly movie, but the two actors have so much sympathy for their characters that the movie, advertised as space fiction, turns into one of 1984's more touching love stories.
8022|0|Beautifully shot, but ultimately dull and plot-free drama that's both elusive and frustrating, despite a strong performance from Binoche.

8014|1|All Or Nothing may seem depressing, but in fact uplifts us.
70108|1|Leave it to Hollywood to make a bold, challenging film for teens (and adults) only to let it collect dust on a shelf as proposed release dates were set, then scratched, many times over.
75730|1|The fun is infectious -- the puns, in-jokes and referential asides will keep Shakespeare buffs busy and the rest of the audience entertained even as some punch lines zing over their heads.
63230|1|...a decent espionage escapade and a fairly suspenseful thriller that passes an entertaining few hours.
1377|1|Learning, especially from Scorsese, in his approach to action and performance, writer/director/star Stallone has somehow contrived to make each of his movies into a more magnificent spectacle than the last.
56410|1|I was hooked to the screen, to the film's sense of time and place and risk, to the intelligence of the talk and the intimations of pleasure and regret in Bonham Carter's performance.
60889|1|Branagh has some terrific sight gags up his sleeve, and the songs themselves are absolutely wonderful.
11343|1|Orson Welles' heavily chopped up drama, it is still a nostalgic, dramatically powerful tale and should ultimately be savored for what it is rather than rejected for what it is not.
11815|0|One of the worst sequels ever
9157|0|It is a coarse-grained and exploitive work which depends on excess for its impact. Ashore it is a bore, awkwardly staged and lumpily written.
61341|1|The subject remained interesting enough to this provincial American to accept and ultimately enjoy the film's well-worn romanticism, even with its resignedly tired happy ending.

43174|1|It's amazing how much action can be crammed into a movie about a war where most soldiers didn't actually see any action. Three Kings has its fair share of shootouts, none that are merely squeezed in for guilty pleasures. Every shot fired is motivated by c

31015|1|In spite of its age and the fact that its 145-minute mass is sometimes dragging, Oklahoma! hollers itself home as a handsome piece of entertainment.
13298|1|Make no mistake, Kevin Smith's talky, farcical comedy of cosmic errors is clever. But it's clever in a deeply juvenile way.
62597|1|The production has one premise -- deliberately mismatched dialog -- which is sustained reasonably well through its brief running time.
65495|1|Rare handling of an emotional and important theme.
31798|0|... features a mesmerizing kid actor. But, as good as his acting is, it's just a one-note performance ... that starts off as intriguing but ends up becoming tiresomely repetitive.
590|1|There are plenty of things wrong with Shooter but the quantity and indeed the quality of the explosions isn't one of them.
17387|1|There are movies of uncomplicated simian enjoyment and there's Walking Tall, in which a stirring courtroom defense culminates with the dramatic ripping open of a shirt.
5348|1|A first-class Mafia thriller that is also, in its way, a love story.
16114|1|So Marilyn can act. Who knew?
52721|1|The songs are all written and performed flawlessly by Bjork. And not only can the pixie goddess sing and dance, she can also act.
32629|1|This is American self-absorption at its finest.
80602|1|With its constant juxtaposition of blazing nighttime highwayscapes and the flat Nebraska skyline, Boys Don't Cry manages to perfectly evoke both a life spent in aimless forward motion and the stifling boredom Brandon was so desperate to escape.
20245|1|One of the most vivid, impassioned and painfully believable love stories ever committed to celluloid.
46256|0|An imperfect storm of horrible writing, awkward casting and questionable taste gathers soon after the opening credits and dumps downpours of buzz-killing humour at depressingly regular intervals.
8112|0|Which is worse? Lame jokes about gays or lame jokes about the mob?
58808|1|Sofia Coppola's sophomore film (following the gently assured The Virgin Suicides) is another exploration of delicate relationships and uncommunicated frustrations, this one in a beautifully composed atmosphere of isolation.

44044|1|a satisfying romance that works from beginning to end, featuring movie stars of the day that you just can't help but adore
36284|0|It's not eccentric enough to be as otherworldly as it wants to be, but it's too self-consciously quirky to perform on its own merits.
27303|1|Gordon has directed drama, such as Mamet's 'Edmond', but also visceral horror movies like 'Re-Animator'. Elements of both are evident in this taut psychological thriller.
32222|0|This hugely disturbing, disgusting movie is likely to turn on film buffs with its clever cross-cutting, but it's ultimately a pretentious waste of time.
76553|0|While Eastwood dedicates the film to Sergio Leone and Don Siegel, his early directors, he doesn't seem to have learned all that much from them.
5840|1|Genial but Dull and heavy-handed Ruritarian comedy that co-stars the 50-year-old British stage great Olivier with the 30-year-old American Hollywood sex queen Marilyn Monroe.
2927|0|Barred is tremendously crude, unapologetically manipulative (Zeus finally breaks down Rip's reserve by crippling his kid brother), and aimed directly at easily entertained 13-year-old boys.
17738|1|The film looks gorgeous in HD, and remains the best Hollywood treatment of Pearl Harbor.

3557|1|Quick and to the point when it comes to delivering scares.
66161|1|Harron's Psycho reps an impressive reclaiming of dubious material.
1937|0|Disney has struck once again, taking a passably entertaining cartoon and turning it into a motion picture so lifeless that it's almost unwatchable.
40283|0|There's no questioning its authenticity.... However, the movie tends to make its points early and then repeat itself unnecessarily.
45017|1|Vincent Cassel has a huge amount of fun as LaRoche, overacting the Evil Frenchman bit to the point where he's practically twirling a moustache.

40556|1|Viewers expecting a compendium of horror will be disappointed for these tales are gentle, ironic and sad. All are stunningly photographed and exquisitely designed.
12085|1|Critic Andrew Sarris wasn't just playing the fanboy when he described this movie as 'The Citizen Kane of jukebox musicals.' He just might have been selling it short.

17103|0|What we have is a comedy that's not that great, a romance that's not that convincing and a movie that's sadly not that special. Now that's how you lose friends and alienate people.

80257|0|I am against the exploitation of women for sentimental screen purposes (Steel Magnolias, Crimes of the Heart). But what can you do? Here they moon and croon across a time divide.
17209|0|As a big fan of the original, I'd just as soon not acknowledge this film exists. My hunch is that stars Eric Christian Olsen and Derek Richardson feel similarly.
68341|0|Only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives, still with the boiler suit and white mask, which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry.

29979|1|A good-looking, well-wrought film with some knockout special effects, some dark humor and crisp portrayals.

6384|0|The film somehow fails to take wing, even into the positively humble, low-lying purlieus of British domestic farce.
19928|0|An utterly lackluster production that most involved would be wise to keep out of their portfolios. The only director to come out of this mess looking good is Rodriguez.
64556|0|It's largely a cheap looking, tawdry affair, with tortuous interludes in which the humour devolves on gratuitous unpleasantness or tired old bad jokes at the expense of women.

8370|0|A delicately nuanced film about remembrance -- so delicate, perhaps, that it's not terribly memorable itself.

21838|1|More character study than thriller, it can stand on its own merits. It's probably not exactly what you wanted, but it just might be enough.
71279|1|Julia Roberts has never been more fragile or stunning. And by oncerning itself with truthful consequences of its characters' self-sacrifices, the film succeeds as a drama as much about the passion of personal investment as the pursuit of justice.

52667|1|Snow Day is not a perfect film, but there's enough cleverness for adults to tolerate it, and kids will likely appreciate some of the more juvenile moments.

53932|0|Instead of arresting a downward-spiralling career, Hartley's latest folly (one of the worst movies in Cannes 2001) shows what happens to an iconoclastic director when he neglects his intsinctive talent for small, quirly indies and goes uproariously big.

44443|1|Maybe Richard Kelly's fate is to be the cult-film circuit's Michael Cimino. He has yet to match the mood or magnitude of his debut - a collision of time-travel sci-fi, commentary on '80s malaise and teen angst that's simultaneously witty and poignant.
80372|1|The plot is pure French farce, but it's played dead straight, more like a thriller or tragedy. And the result is both insightful and involving.
47609|0|It's not just homosexuals who will be outraged by this crass farce.

54470|0|Bangs and clangs and has some impressive effects, but it seems to have forgotten one thing: These movies used to be giddy, rock 'em, sock 'em fun. This one is just plain grim.
71508|0|While a visual treat, Mimic is exactly that, a film which mimics other styles and plot elements. In this case Alien and David Cronenberg's The Fly and Videodrome.
81355|1|I won't pretend that I completely enjoyed it, but it certainly has a few elements that I've never seen before. Action aficionados will undoubtedly slobber all over themselves.
72014|1|Nearly 90 years on, Eisenstein's masterpiece is still guaranteed to get the pulse racing.
71359|0|It all adds up to a few good bits spread thinly across an even thinner concept for a movie.

11431|0|Even by standards of Ron Bass, who has written soupy chick flicks, this fake emotional drama is a minor work; too bad French helmer Berliner made his English-speaking debut with this trifle

39898|1|Writer and director John Waters has fashioned a sassy, irreverent movie about art, fame, culture shock, and class consciousness.
30437|1|Writer/director Herman pulls off a popular, proletarian comedy which might actually appeal to the people it's about.
27143|1|Honda's satire is cutting, with several characters resigned to living with the threat of constant cataclysm.
82005|0|Awkwardly conceived in a superficial reality that leaves its punch lines without much punch.
41627|0|Danny DeVito's directing debut seems to indicate he is not yet ready to direct. The characters are neither believable nor likable and the comedy is not funny.
28517|0|About as nerve-wracking as a warm bath.
17333|1|There are few topics that generate more controversy than abortion, yet Mike Leigh's film seems wholly uninterested in courting debate.

22218|1|A great film? No, but it's pleasant enough, with attractive actors, and the interspersed Bollywood numbers are a hoot.
76005|0|Unfortunately--no offense, now--this is mainly a case of the Old Couple, given the mediocre direction of Howard Deutch and, mostly, the surprisingly bland script by Neil Simon.
73249|1|Perhaps the most dynamic and enthralling cinematic storytelling ever to emerge from the mystique-shrouded fog of rock 'n' roll relationships.
19663|0|One of Spielberg's rare and true misfires. It's weirdly creepy when it's not being bombastically boring.
16876|1|As long as the movie refuses to commit itself, it is a truly creepy, nerve-jangling experience.
501|1|The few saving graces are the gorgeous Elisha Cuthbert and the fun bad guy turn by Timothy Olyphant.
18770|0|Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles is a series of vignettes. The retro quality can only carry so far, and it isn't long before the film buckles under its own weight.
57188|0|The human figure, however, remains a challenge to current CGI technology, since the detailing of hair and freckles, for instance, proves rather more credible than the marionette-like impression created by cold eyes and oddly unconvincing body movements.
27032|1|The most intriguing portions of this drama involve tales of how the elder Peebles circumvents the system in order to keep the camera rolling.
74506|1|En route to this cynical fade-out, Conspiracy Theory does show off enough glossy style ... and incidental cleverness to keep viewers largely hooked.
126|1|A guilty pleasure.
77555|0|It's exploitation at its most listless and uninspired.
64598|0|... the film astoundingly reaches new levels of unintentional self-parody with every turn.

54018|1|Whether Se√±or Bu√±uel means his picture as a reflection of all people or just the people of Spain is not clear nor, indeed, is it essential. It is an ugly, depressing view of life. And, to be frank about it, it is a little old-fashioned, too.
15803|1|Director Chuck Sheetz spins it into an enjoyable breeze. The humor regularly hits the mark, and the kid lessons are well baked.
7255|0|Mindless entertainment for the end of the summer, with emphasis on the mindless.
42006|1|It's a good formalic romantic comedy. Nothing more.
76369|1|Every scene is pitched at the highest level and acted accordingly.
63009|1|Serves as a relaunching pad for the magical talents of Maggie Gyllenhaal as Jude.
33072|0|"Insufferably mean-spirited, ""Drillbit Taylor"" is, believe it or not, a movie about bullies aimed at young people."
31281|1|There's no suspense and no big emotional payoff, but the movie is always absorbing.
24055|1|A sharp, fast, laugh-out-loud comedy.
14421|0|The animators have clearly done their research, but while the film's cultural specificity isn't distasteful per se, it's still pretty soulless.
24059|1|Dream of Life barely hints at the transformational energy that Smith exudes in person, but it does paint a portrait of a defiantly creative life.
50144|1|A tension-filled drama with great performances from Hayden Christensen and Peter Sarsgaard.
7516|0|The scenery is pretty but the movie never makes one wish to be in it.
32593|0|The sort of film whose makers would be pleased to hear it called 'unclassifiable.' A more accurate description is 'unfathomable.'
17940|0|Its satire of action-movie mindlessness and screenwriting-as-prostitution is dated and without bite.
57594|0|It is a film about intelligence in unlikely places that, paradoxically, requires you to check your brain at the door.

9216|0|Much too gentle to inspire any dramatic reaction on either end of the opinion spectrum.
32366|0|[The film] runs an insufferable two hours, leisurely chugging toward an ending most of the audience will have predicted 15 minutes in.
71704|0|Long and dull, despite the sumptuous production design and light-shimmering photography (and the orgy).
5518|0|Too often writer/directors such as Light It Up's Craig Bolotin don't take the time to create a plausible plot and realistic dialog.
81803|0|Well acted and, within its limited terms, well made, Gallipoli represents a failure of nerve as well as design.
69704|1|While the future was uncertain, the resolute characters of this exquisite wartime drama found peace through love and resistance.
36175|1|This moody ghost story follows generally familiar lines despite its unusual historical setting, but it's imaginatively filmed and builds a sense of brooding emotional power.
28099|0|Wild America feels like something the Walt Disney company produced for junior-high-classroom consumption 30 years ago.

55707|1|Its well characterised comedy of playground manners and teasing social awareness rings confidently through.
69246|0|Martyrs is an unforgettable (not necessarily a good thing) endurance test of a movie that provides a quasi-philosophical spin on the torture porn genre.
21027|1|A promising directorial debut by Myles Berkowitz.
14934|0|Although this is an uninspired re-working of the Die Hard formula, it is probably O.K. as mindless holiday entertainment.
81259|0|I'm sure the producers of Angela's Ashes meant well, but they got the wrong guy to direct it.
56132|0|As a study of human nature under pressure, focusing on the crimes we commit as well as the bonds of solidarity we forge, it's unremittingly dour.
17385|1|Sure, it's a non-stop cavalcade of tasteless jokes and crude sexual humor, but there's nothing wrong with that. I like tasteless jokes and crude sexual humor.
30425|0|This is a slow track of wish-fullfillment fantasy and all who come through the turnstiles will wear a happy face.
40110|1|A good small movie featuring a different kind of love story..
41187|1|It's an enjoyable adventure tale, especially for youngsters.
50177|0|Unfortunately, a cast of competent performers from movies, television and the theater are cast adrift in various New York City locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style.

50501|0|While a pleasant, well-animated family film, Stuart Little 2 is not as gripping as the first movie and lacks the emotional punch associated with the best of the genre.
198|1|Fast-paced and witty, this is Chase's best solo venture to date, and will hold almost anyone's attention for its well-edited 98 minutes.
74395|1|It's all so very Princess Di.
15498|1|It Happened One Night was in many ways a predecessor to the modern romantic comedy, and its dynamics will still feel familiar to the current-day viewer.
81894|0|You probably can't blame pastors moonlighting as moviemakers for wanting to pack their film with multiple messages, but the conversion subplot feels shoehorned into the more crucial marital doings.
73909|1|Sverak has a great feeling for the glories of airplanes, and the technical resources in the picture are astounding.
725|0|It's more dumbfounding that so much time is wasted on a cast of unknowns, second-stringers granted solos long before Kelly or Justin take center stage. Why not support with other first-season alums?
70135|1|Easily the best film of its genre since 'Soul Food' and definitely makes for a excellent holiday season treat.

4202|1|[Haggis] makes his directing debut with a screenplay that often seems rigged and contrived, but comes to life via excellent acting and a philosophical argument that bigotry and benevolence are inextricably intertwined.
80409|1|What's amazing is that so much of Gish's tough, funny, intuitive performance, particularly in the film's middle section as she bears her illegitimate child, transcends time, place and technology.
40405|1|A highly personal meditation on the choices we make that define our identity.
12912|1|It looked back 2000 years for its comic content, but was a decade ahead in provoking Christian controversy. Yet how much hotter would the steaming Pilate of blasphemy-accusations have got if the Pythons had included their scripted mockeries of Zionism?

59272|1|Dench's performance is the greatest pleasure in a hugely enjoyable, highly literate drama.
47139|1|This film is about many things, but the magic key that unlocks the treasure chest is literacy.

14912|1|A knock-out
1238|1|Vibrant, luxurious, full of razzle-dazzle fantasy and a delicious visual feast, yes, but watching it is rather like devouring a box of expensive chocolates in one go.

18635|1|Another movie that pretty much wastes Sellers.
8389|1|It's a vexing film that teases with sex and serves up radical politics. But it has extraordinary alchemical powers, turning the most ordinary environment -- a young couple's suburban flat -- into a minefield of ideas.

25|1|A sullen drama from the first scene until the last, anchored by rather sincere performances and conveyed in the sorts of shadows and silence that were the staples of mainstream film noir.
12992|1|The strong point of this gripping dramatic story set in pioneer Wyoming is a constantly mounting suspense.
18613|1|It's a story that has taken 10 years to get to the screen at least, but what kept it from the screen for so long was lost when it was finally filmed.
35833|0|The concert footage, which is exceptionally well photographed and recorded, offers clips of varying lengths from a wealth of songs. The rest of the film glimpses the stress disorders that can develop when average people with problems become popular.
12214|1|The characters are without recognizable virtues, and neither they nor the movie asks us to like them. But they are full of energy and underplayed wit, endlessly picking themselves up off the filthy floor.
32089|1|Odd, atmospheric thriller that completely falls apart in the finale
69630|1|An inspiring drama about an idealistic teacher who breaks down the walls separating her students from each other and enables them to celebrate their unity in diversity.
62326|1|Though the metaphysical overtones of the screenplay are sometimes awkwardly handled and Eastwood's direction of actors (other than himself) is occasionally uncertain, this was one of the better American films of 1985.
74826|0|Great story but stilted film.
78631|0|Probably the worst Jackie Chan vehicle to come around in his career...

42021|1|Ignore the dull framing device and this is a watchable period crime drama. Pity about the dull, oft-used title though.
1184|0|One of James's juiciest scenarios, but barely anybody involved in this enterprise seems to have caught its groove.
4057|1|Jodie Foster, the real-life mother of two young sons, follows 'Panic Room' with another thriller that allows her to physicalize her maternal instincts into action-movie heroics. (Does her experience as a child actor help explain this protective streak?)
79725|1|LL Cool J and Thomas Jane (are you looking for the new Steve McQueen? HE'S RIGHT HERE) keep the movie rolling.
77995|1|'Amiable' is an odd way to describe a crime drama that contains wall-spattering amounts of bloodshed, but it fits The Hard Word.
5760|1|The kind of thing that leads to sleepless nights -- from severely bruised rib cages.
73621|1|Excellently acted version of the play is finally rather dull.
36910|1|slow and beautiful, rather than intense, dramatic and insightful
35644|1|The film is directed by Steven Spielberg, and breaks new ground in content and style. It merges some of the most realistically disturbing battle footage ever included in a feature film with a touching human story.
24024|1|Very dated and not consistently funny but famous for the iconic Marilyn air-vent shot and a close to the under-wire smuttiness.
2972|0|Law interprets his laconic character so well that the lack of chemistry between Inman and Ada made me care very little if their romance was ever resurrected.
32696|1|Don't even look for Clarence the Angel in this slow paced, but effective story.
20842|0|Although an advance on Hollywood's usual treatment of racial themes, the script is too message-laden and the direction (by do-gooder Kramer) too single-minded and naively optimistic to really work.

23405|0|Bay directs Armageddon in a way that seems more concerned with constantly assaulting the senses than anything else, hoping perhaps that the quick cuts and constant explosions will distract from his film's many flaws.
12963|1|Good things come in small packages
2512|1|The many cliche elements in Physical Evidence are whipped into some semblance of new life.
17207|1|Vinton's own animated style is so subversive and gives the Christmas festivities a needed surrealism.
9089|1|The film still remains fresh, as amazingly the many one-liners and the wacky situation still work.
18835|0|It's your usual low-budget, unbelievably bad sequel.
63310|1|Quirky, wild comedy doings with Bill Murray over the top.
1389|1|Whatever its flaws, films made with this much chutzpah last forever. Doctor Zhivago wears its daunting runtime like the lightest of shawls and, even after all these years, it's still worth surrendering your heart to.
62731|0|Denzel Washington and Bob Hoskins in an action-ghost-buddy comedy? Uh huh.
45262|1|You pretty much have to like Will Ferrell to like Talladega Nights, it's his film through and through. But if you do, you're in for a ride.
44296|1|Not unlike Fritz Lang's equally misanthropic Scarlet Street, Ace in the Hole plays the squashing of one man's human spirit for societal-weary gravitas.
68852|1|In Darger's apartment, the surreal became real, and a testament to the life's work of a simple man.
48176|1|Part surfing film, part travelogue, occasionally even anthropological study and wildlife film, ultimately it visually taps into the wanderlust that sends us to far-flung beaches in search of an escape from life that we can't find at home.
52012|1|At turns heartbreaking and heart-stirring.
19283|1|We've grown accustomed to more violent, more suspenseful, and scarier stories than these, but there's no questioning the quality of this film.
12297|1|This powerful story, reminiscent of Dostoyevsky's 'Crime and Punishment,' is told with a minimum of dialogue.
4845|1|"Strange and a little awkward, ""Secret Window"" nonetheless is worth a look."
23783|1|Tons of fun, really, and Donald Pleasence as Blofeld is inimitable.

60894|0|Wes Anderson manages to make the exotic Indian countryside seem like a suburb of Houston.
8701|1|The movie is as airy as a spun-sugar dessert, but Thompson's observations on the artistic life are both affectionate and knowing: Beauty and wealth, though inevitably compelling, are appreciated as means to humane ends, not goals in themselves.
80726|1|McConaughey's over-the-top performance is brilliant, but not a single person actually gets killed with a chainsaw.
10720|1|A tense and compelling supernatural thriller.
32769|1|Most significantly, the film underscores the fact that the meaning of our lives ultimately comes from somewhere outside of ourselves.
21684|0|In keeping with his generally perverse filmmaking aesthetic, von Trier systematically does everything he can to alienate horror enthusiasts.
70935|1|"An efficient cop thriller, with a charismatic performance from Roundtree as ""the cat that won't cop out when there's danger all about...Shaft!"" Can you dig it?"
60277|0|It's the sort of experience you feel embarrassed about even though you had nothing to do with it, because it's not just a mess, it's a pretentious mess
58258|1|Part of the degraded charm of End of Days is its buffet-table derivative approach.
22789|0|While the prospect of watching Miss Hawn play a rude, nasty socialite is appealing, and even the transformation to homebody is a funny idea, Overboard winds up taking things too far.
10340|1|Trying to address important and serious social issues in this violent world rather than just creating something sensationalistic or exploitative gives Elite Squad an edge over normal police thrillers.
16438|1|One could easily argue that there are enough tangled plotlines here for several interesting films.

2187|0|There are just enough good ideas sitting around in their loneliness that you can imagine a version of this story that is actually worthwhile.
13235|0|About two-thirds in, the movie shifts gears disastrously. Made me want to haul someone into the cutting room for revenge.
77566|0|Boasting state-of-the-art gimcracks and a solid cast, the motion picture lifts off easily enough. Only it's not long before you realize that mission control forgot to load the Tang.
78615|1|There's no mistaking Flight of the Navigator for a really first-rate children's picture like, say, The Black Stallion. But Flight of the Navigator is an enjoyable film that encourages kids to use their heads.

8010|1|...A serviceable piece of juvenile entertainment with high production values and low expectations.
26805|1|The blend of animation techniques somehow demonstrates mastery modestly, while the special effects are nothing short of magnificent.
58575|1|Deals with a mining strike in 19th century France and comes across as a poignant depiction of class warfare.
75591|1|In order for us to believe in the future and to step into it with buoyancy, we need the nurturing support of those nearest and dearest to us. Then hope floats.
39887|1|For such a downbeat story, the film is full of humor and vivacity. The characters, though frustrated and delusional, are fully realized by the exceptional cast.
19048|1|An American's quest for the meaning of life takes him from Iowa to Tibet to discover the spiritual practices of equanimity, atttention, and compassion.
58525|1|Solondz is a courageous social commentator and a canny provocateur at the same time. He'll never get to Hollywood if he stays on this track, but cinema will be a lot duller if he ever mends his incendiary ways.
18185|1|Moore's typically prickly demeanor, often cited by her detractors as her biggest liability as an actress, actually works to her advantage here, as she unearths the voracious ambition in Jordan's soul.
17333|1|Criterion Collection's two-disc set... [is] a small film-school education, through the copious supplementary materials, on how the film broke new ground, why it remains so important today...
37464|1|Interesting, with strong performances, though not thoroughly convincing
70760|1|Good movie about the consequences of our choices.
12832|1|Tragically underseen, this Preston Sturges comedy is all of 68 minutes long (including the credits) and is a freakin' laugh riot from start to finish.
18364|1|A spirited cast, including old pros Amma Meara and younger talent Parker Posey and Stanley Tucci, elevates this claustrophobic sitcom (most of whiche is set in a car) into something fluffier and funnier than it actually is.
12101|1|It might almost be a subgenre: the Accidental Family film. It's enjoyable and a welcome break from the studio pictures, but it's familiar to you even as you're watching it.
6166|0|Unlike Armageddon, this film possesses a plot. Granted, it is the insipid plot of a made-for-TV miniseries, but at least it is an actual, tangible plot.
77045|1|The characters are beautifully drawn in this bittersweet melodrama written and directed by Mark Herman.
4717|0|But, oh, how I laughed.
5126|1|You don't have to know about music to appreciate the film's easygoing blend of comedy and romance.
53675|0|Although the film is a comedy, it can't overcome the fact that it is profoundly sad that people in this country are so spiritually starved they would seek fulfillment by watching a shopping channel.
15417|1|Solid and emotionally direct but not the concussive powerhouse many will be hoping for.
34134|1|If you can go with the film's leisurely flow and accept the restraints it holds its lovers in check with, it can be a spellbinding film experience.
7944|1|There's something incredibly simple yet profound about what Apted has done with this series. It's an amazing achievement - not only is it a sociological masterpiece, but it's a fine example of how real-life drama can often be more compelling than fiction.
12514|1|A powerful testimony to the changes that may come when people make an effort to let their voices be heard.
9935|0|The urine-quaffing gags and hearty barfing asides are the lowbrow price extracted for...gestures towards semi-intelligence.
12975|1|Here's an anomaly: a comedy about smart people.
51340|1|Shore and Wilde have done an admirable job in re-imagining Wilde's play as a movie, and they've created a wrenching, thoughtful entertainment that incorporates considerable comic relief.
27766|0|It's a military maxim that there is no room for egos on a submarine. Which prompts the question if there's any more room for another military movie set below the waves?
58312|0|Fails to produce one single convincingly realistic moment.
7679|0|...a thoroughly trashy piece of work...

4001|0|... the only real surprise is how genuinely dreadful a movie that aims only for pleasant, profitable mediocrity can be.
71018|0|Sadly, we never really get the sense that these individuals are at the mercy of their capricious desires, and the absence of that engagement leaves us rather too much time to ponder the plot holes.

46483|1|A compelling, but not likable, film.
52217|1|Call it an anti-rom-com, and see it if you can.
42586|0|A bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be.
11481|1|A fall-out-of-the-chair, funny movie!
71424|1|As frothily entertaining as this caper is, it's unlikely to prove as popular with grown-ups as Shrek and the Toy Story movies.

3423|1|It's the closest a film has ever gotten to a roller-coaster ride. It will definitely nauseate, it feels claustrophobic, there are sudden scares, and it also peaks too early.
22911|1|It is the work of a remarkable new talent.
77903|0|Austerely directed but shamelessly dry, uneventful and derivative.
64560|1|A blackly comic and insidiously sly love story in the unforgiving underworld of mob families and freelance criminals...
11769|1|It's a stately, handsome-looking studio drama that, for me, never really became emotionally or intellectually involving.
13650|1|Conventional, slight, but charming.
76058|1|Peter Hyams' strong direction and Connery's commanding presence make this handsome-looking action-thriller worth seeing.
34771|1|contains a few nuggets I didn't already know, but by and large it's entry-to-mid-level material
41190|1|No, it's not a masterpiece, nor is it meant to be. For those of us greatly amused by the little rascal, this is a definite four-star movie.
7731|0|"A limp romantic comedy, this cut-and-paste bookend to last year's ""Hitch"" finds Sarah Jessica Parker playing Paula a demoralized romantic turned ""professional interventionist."""

65413|1|Perhaps ahead of its time, certainly too ambitious for its budget and its era, Legend is nevertheless a fascinating film

51479|1|Rowlands' perfectly pitched approach to a demanding role is particularly stunning.
49060|1|Wrongly written off as another '70s disaster movie, this is really an outstanding cat-and-mouse suspense thriller laced with knowing cynicism.
25631|0|Slight and predictable at its core.

65283|1|It's a gripping and powerful film that intrigues by the confluence of the mundane with the extraordinary.
60244|1|Far more vital than Allen's last few pictures, Anything Else should serve as lifesaving tourniquet; It's no cure for wounded fans but it'll stop the bleeding.

304|1|Perfect for Easter TV.
63471|1|Hindsight has lent this gripping, serious-minded melodrama a certain righteous intensity.
59188|0|Saturn 3 remains a mere gender curio of the era. It's too rotten to be anything else.
62932|0|The art of it is entirely in the atmospherics; the rest is melodrama. Its 127 minute exercise in puzzle solving is draining.

18241|1|A very good film with an intriguing and disturbing message.
12354|1|I would imagine that many would find it unwatchable, or would incorrectly deem it uncinematic, but it understands the language of cinema better than nearly any film that I've seen. Every cut, every pan, every zoom matters.
30296|1|It's a triumph of form over content, but it's a stunning triumph.
40888|1|Though not particularly deep or original, La Scorta displays intimate scale, taut narrative, and recognizably human characters; considering that it deals with crime, there's little violence on screen.

17758|1|It's not as dark or as edgy as Tim Burton's Batman films, but it's still cleaner and more digestible. It's not a deep story, but it's full of fun nostalgia and action.

3876|1|Atom Egoyan has conjured up a multilayered work that tackles any number of fascinating issues
15080|0|It is hopelessly inept and incompetent, but has a place in the canon, albeit a lowly one. It lets us know how badly things can go wrong, and how passion is not always enough.

37203|0|While Blanchett's presence is surely felt in virtually every scene of the movie, her acting isn't. We don't connect with her at all.
16797|0|Despite attempts to turn the fairytale genre on its head, the characters are predictable stereotypes.

78838|0|Basically, any movie that suffers from a lack of Charlie Sheen has got problems.
51402|1|It is a breezy, richly enjoyable if not especially profound film about cinema: it conjures the ambient, dizzy sexiness of movie artifice, and it's also notable for a remarkable cameo by Graham Greene.
67899|1|One of the better films of the infamous J-horror remake onslaught. Relatively speaking.
7587|1|An excellent crime drama in the style of Raymond Chandler, James M. Cain, and Dashiell Hammett.

12250|1|This is, not to put too fine a point on it, a swashbuckler, a costume drama. If you love that old story form, you will be in old-fogy heaven, as it is nearly a perfect example of a genre that died out years ago.
16965|1|It's the director's willingness to toughen conventions through personal idiosyncrasies that sets the film apart.

17577|0|The ultralightweight Next Stop Wonderland could have easily been Next Stop Slumberland.
31453|1|Maborosi is one of those valuable films where you have to actively place yourself in the character's mind. There are times when we do not know what she is thinking, but we are inspired with an active sympathy.
55644|0|Despite its original concept, the movie loses much of its socially satiric edge once Fraser emerges from his underground bunker and starts wooing Silverstone.
39864|1|One of the great Tracy-Hepburn pairings, this adaptation from the Broadway stage focuses on the love that grows from the contentious relationship...
7035|1|The film raises the questions it hopes churches will answer. It's clearly designed to open discussion on these questions, and to encourage churches to discuss sexual abuse.
72657|1|A ride that doesn't take us far enough.
37730|1|This masterpiece from Frank Capra still has a lot to say about community spirit and is a film with much more to it than feel-good sentimentality.
77526|0|These four characters bounce off each other, slowly revealing motivations and desires and deceptions, providing a mildly entertaining, but ultimately shallow, experience.

27868|1|Palahniuk's novels are so wilfully quirky, so egocentric, so out there, that transferring them to the screen must be like using chopsticks to transport a blancmange across a room.
6655|0|In ''Shakedown,'' something fancy happens every 15 minutes or so, which is part of what makes the whole film so unremarkable.
17765|1|As disgusting, harrowing, and ugly as the 1974 horror classic The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is, the film has moments of eerie beauty.
35337|1|There just seemed to be a missing ingredient to raise this intense psychological drama to the level of a Rashomon.
15579|0|Are they funny? Most of the time. But the humor, passing itself off as insightful social commentary, rarely rises above simple stereotypes.

79626|0|The film is either a celebration of depravity or a warning against Godlessness, though no one knows which and Fellini doesn't bother to make the distinction himself.
59428|1|For every scene that goes nowhere -- and there are more than a few -- there's some comedy gold lurking around the corner.
79567|0|Like our two loose cannons with badges, the movie misses its target at least as often as it hits it. Along the way, as well, it will likely batter a few brain cells into a premature grave.

18442|1|I'm not sure that I have ever seen a more compelling picture of sudden violence as is depicted here - Malkovich's approach is apt, since the film takes place in a world where terrorist acts are the order of the day.

16035|1|If this movie's concept appeals to you at all, I urge you to reward the filmmakers by seeing in the theatre if at all possible. It's so small but so special. For you zombie fans, it's a great dessert after all the carnage, but it still delivers what we

1796|1|From the start, it was less important whether or not you agreed with Lee than if you appreciated him for stirring things up.
12151|1|As so often with adaptations of Williams, it frequently errs on the side of overstatement and pretension, but still remains immensely enjoyable as a piece of cod-Freudian codswallop.
44656|1|Inspired by Pygmalion and other works about mentor-pupil troubled/rewarding interaction, Lewis Gilbert's film is too theatrical, betraying its origins, but it's elevated by sparkling performances from Michael Caine and paricularly newcomer Julie Walters

76702|1|A highly unlikely blend of savage violence, farcical humor and impossible romantic yearning, acted out with sometimes awe-inspiring precision.
8896|1|It's a strange and weird and wonderful mix of boy's own adventure, Python-esque humor, and grim irony, all wrapped in tall tales, ancient myths, and historical figures.

52949|1|Hilarious and unexpectedly touching. A great vehicle for Keaton.
72909|1|This dilemma between the desire not to mature and the infallibility of age is best summated in Nino Rota's score. It highlights the film's beautiful final shots and lends the final exit an air of playful hope.
913|1|The film is helped, by wonderful performances by two of the top talents in the business in Streep and Hurt, and Zellweger stays right with them.

35759|1|One of the more amusing Bond films.
66227|1|A little gem with a wonderful performance from little Nina Kervel.

46493|1|A funny tongue-in-cheek comedy, cinematic commentary and murder mystery all rolled in to one.
51691|1|Not a bad film, despite what you may have heard, but there is no doubt it should have been a lot better.
11398|0|An irritating experience

890|0|Wahlberg is atrocious, as wooden as the trees terrorising him.
16189|0|Under the circumstances it's not really fair to blame the actors, whose amateurishness seems appropriate to the material (although Diesel's stolid machismo is so over-the-top as to be pretty laughable).

45120|1|A fun, fast comic-thriller that serves the talents of Cryer magnificently
32440|1|"Patinkin's performance is especially touching. He can say, ""My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die"" -- and make you laugh, cry and cheer at the same time. The movie, two hours of pure enchantment, has the same effect."
21749|1|[Maddin] taps a rich vein in this highly memorable and frequently disturbing homage to lost innocence and German expressionism.

2592|0|An unintentionally hilarious cross between Basic Instinct and The Parent Trap.

40711|1|Just a well-made, well-acted melodrama that is quiet and reflective instead of big and bombastic.
5874|1|The real violence, as is always the case with Mamet, lies not in the mayhem but in the thrusting rhythms of the dialogue.
8555|0|Sexy, bold, exotic and fun in some ways, but still stuck with a lackluster style and pedestrian plot that brand it as everyday entertainment fare.

21569|1|There is something very carnal about watching the production fall apart and see the reputation of Coppola hang in the balance.
28202|0|Does manage to deliver a few jokes of its own, but this sequel is nothing but a pale retread of a true classic. Nice to see all the old faces, though.

24538|1|Hughes is simply doing what they tell you the first day of creative writing class: write about what you know. And he's doing it with both craft and a good deal of emotional honesty.
4833|1|Ms. Bassett portrays this high-strung superwoman with such intensity that she makes her almost believable.
11790|0|The stream-of-consciousness structure effectively captures a mind lost in thought; what it doesn't effectively create, however, is drama.
15642|0|The film relies too heavily on gimmicks ... And the mystery plotting and dialogue are weak at best.
13483|1|A typical, but very effective chronicle of yet another man's downfall in the black hole that is fame through rock and roll, and the complacent enabling of his friends and family.
76075|1|An exceptional piece of filmmaking, a drama that blurs the line between the ultra-violent cop movie genre and weepy but moving melodrama, and does it very convincingly.
54755|1|Life may be messy, but it's usually entertaining.
40535|1|It remains the most complex and enlivening of Hitchcock's earliest films.
15871|1|It's brief, frivolous, and extremely entertaining even as some of it seems forced, and the film lacks the elegance of Wilde's wordplay.

42438|1|Characteristically Kubrick in both its mechanistic coldness and its vision of human endeavour undone by greed and deceit, this noir-ish heist movie is nevertheless far more satisfying than most of his later work.
5297|0|The sort of nerve required to produce an excellent screenplay like Chinatown seems to have deserted Towne in this, his directorial debut.
7914|1|Rivetingly grotesque!

20025|1|I don't see how anyone who enjoys their animated movies won't enjoy all of this one.
43579|1|The movie is melodramatic, the acting stiff, and the music overwrought; yet I'm sure that's exactly why audiences liked the movie in the first place and why we find it so much fun today.
71638|0|How can we be inspired by the spirit of Jaguar Paw when the film's telling us that people stink and the great cultures of the Americas were the architects of their own demise?

12966|1|If not a masterpiece of thespianism, it's at least a fun ride through Smith's quirky mind and the lives of his unique characters.

59203|1|The director's pacing and the relaxed and smooth editing by Jay Rabinowitz make for a dreamy show.
63273|1|The inner tension of the film emerges from Jackson's enjoyment of the girls' bustling insanity and then his gradual withdrawal from it.
74416|1|It's two-plus hours of trinkets and baubles and clever repart√©e beneath a perfect summer sun and beside the whitewashed walls of Fez.
49091|1|What makes the film so intriguing and so beguiling and so utterly wonderful is the way it slowly reveals itself, uncoiling in ways that don't produce dramatic fireworks, but rather gradual realizations
43814|1|Worth seeing for Spacey and Linney but you'll spend more time arguing about the finale than you will about the issue behind it.

17707|1|A moviegoer looking for an empty-headed waste of time could do worse.

60743|0|Craven misses the mark with this one.

13951|1|Any chance to sit down and watch these brilliant cartoons again is a cause for celebration.
80749|0|I admired Intacto more than I liked it, for its ingenious construction and the way it keeps a certain chilly distance between its story and the dangers of popular entertainment.
16433|0|Unfortunately, the characters seem to be doing all the laughing, while the general public has nothing to cling to but the horndog flirtation between mismatched leads William H. Macy and Meg Ryan -- hardly ideal ingredients for mainstream success.
14033|1|If your mood is loose and profane, if you speak hip-hop (or you just like hearing it) and if you think Rock is funny (he is), you'll be glad you checked this out.
14725|1|An unusually cheery movie from veteran British writer-director Mike Leigh; one of the ten best films of 2008
38179|1|Behind its substantial charm and light touch is a movie that's more morbid, alienated, and personal than it lets on.
63911|1|A powerful tale of a son seeking to avenge his father in a world of corporate malfeasance with Hamlet-like dimensions.
189|1|The Proposition depicts male brutality, both within and without the confines of the law, in a beautifully measured way that doesn't kill the intensity of the narrative--wild contrasts, ironic similarities, and all.
16037|1|There's a purity, clarity and honesty to this feminist heart-warmer's melodramatic instincts that make it surprisingly moving and satisfying.
10023|1|Watching the picture, it felt more like a cerebral experience, than a normal film.
39926|1|As a Cold War message movie and cinematic descendent of Fail-Safe, WarGames examines the inherent danger in favoring technology's cool logic and situational calculations.
33520|1|The story could have been turned into a plastic sitcom, but ... the crackling chemistry between Depardieu and MacDowell gives it considerable charm.
19991|1|Who else but Merchant Ivory to give the big-screen treatment to Ishiguro's Booker Prize-winning novel about class, fascism and the stiff upper lip?
8411|1|The Stepfather has no problem standing alone as an excellent horror flick. Fans of the horror genre and fans of just a good campy film will delight in this movie.
66860|1|I found it more pleasurable as a time waster than either Mission: Impossible.
626|1|The edgy humor and oddly compelling lead characters make it well worth seeing.
18453|1|The tonal shifts in White display, for the first time, the emotional depth the trilogy enables, and functions secondly to paint expectations for Red.
36090|1|For my money, this Freudian tale about a beautiful kleptomaniac and liar is one of Hitchcock's best accomplishments, certainly one of his most perverse.
66027|1|Perhaps the nicest werewolf movie ever made -- and how could it not be, when it stars sweetie pie Michael J. Fox?
23064|1|Although the powers at M-G-M are deviating from the normal song-and-dance extravaganza in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, it is a gamble that is paying rich rewards.

37840|1|Walt himself would have been proud of the two-disc special edition, which restores the Disney classic back to its original museum-quality luster ... maybe the only missing extra in this treasure is Bambi Meets Godzilla.
26302|1|It works as a funny and slicker-than-expected parody of the genre.
47770|1|fascinating and exciting

49652|0|Much of this is way over the top, irritating and entertaining in equal measure.
9865|1|The story is by turns comic and pathetic, often flashing midstream from one mood to the other, and Aznavour's performance as the wounded hero is a masterstroke of casting.

16999|1|At times entertaining, but never boring. It sure could have been a lot worse.
32206|0|It's not that it's entirely bad. I liked some of the music and Whitney Houston's singing.
34559|1|A perverse, violent, nutso depiction of romance that even Bonnie and Clyde would shrug off as too hardcore for them.
21609|0|The exposition-heavy screenplay favours deathly dialogue scenes over actually showing us action unfolding.
64575|0|A predictable plot and cheapskate effects deaden Elvira's occasional witty lines, while references to the horror genre make the film busy without going anywhere.
27597|0|More of a camp pop-culture tribute to the soap-opera-ish Tammy Faye than an incisive look at the evangelical world that she and other religious figures once played a lucrative role in.
75722|1|The black magic thriller is undoubtedly cheesy but, no matter, I always get a kick out of Christopher Lee and Richard Widmark, even if the latter is miscast.

77228|0|I'll happily never watch it again..
28020|1|Despite its obvious shortcomings, Meet the Robinsons left me wanting a little more. It's been a long, long time since a Disney film without a little lamp logo at the beginning has made me feel that way.
59753|1|Carefully crafted, notably in its deft dramatic structuring, and has become timely in a way its maker could never have anticipated.
3283|1|presents an even bleaker picture than Rossellini and De Sica
82042|1|There are a few moments of grating sentimentality, but these are balanced with a quirky humour and a mildly daring unpredictability.
5407|1|Precise, simple and deeply serious beneath their breezy and seductive surface, these stories enchantingly explore love's little treacheries and the stubborn immutability of human nature.
52710|0|This 1975 feature is slick and often funny, but the smugness of the satire and the stunted emotions are finally wearying.
65589|0|The biggest weakness of Bordertown is its heavy-handed over-simplification of complex political and economic issues. That and Jennifer Lopez's massive ego.
29208|0|It's the movie equivalent of singing 'Onward Christian Soldiers' to those already in the choir.
41665|1|Under the direction of Martin Campbell, GoldenEye is a film that respects its predecessors. No new heights are scaled here, but it's nevertheless a handsome, well-engineered film that gets the job done.
7609|0|A professional script professionally shot, rather than a personal story burning to be told
4711|1|"One of the year's best films, a rarity in that a play has been successfully transferred to film without having the dialogue seem ""written."""
76507|1|Stylish but emotionally hollow, Paul Schrader's morality tale of a callboy (played by Richard Gere), offers some visual pleasures, including Armani's slick wardrobe.
4900|1|The filmmakers really have captured something quite spectacular with this one.
18008|0|This enormous wheeze comes over like the proverbial movie with a 40 million dollar set and a five cent script, which may hold its interest for under-fives but will leave most others cold.
46750|1|David Lynch's Eraserhead must stand as a pinnacle of screen surrealism to rival Bunuel's Un Chien Andalou.
877|1|This is an entertaining biopic that's worth seeing for the terrific musical sequences and for the superb performances by Anthony and Lopez. Recommended.
271|0|21 Grams thrashes wildly...exhorting us to feel something. Apart from the fleeting satisfaction of its structural parlor game, I felt little...save exhausted boredom.
68685|1|The audience is apt to forget its own vicarious indulgence in some fairly perverse, psychologically unhinged acted out fantasy, as Kevin Costner masterminds erotically tinged guilty pleasures.
18100|1|Very entertaining.
4450|0|Whenever there's something that might be funny, we're socked over the head with sentimentality and our need for laughter evaporates.
6321|0|This very-French-yet-English-language comedy is not only slow, but its stabs at satire are milder than a quarter bouncing off Mount Rushmore.

4686|1|Fahrenheit 9/11 may be taken either as screed or scripture, depending on your own political persuasions. Moore's strength is that, either way, you can't ignore it.
2151|1|One of the most valuable facets of Kitano's film is its exposure of the gangster ideal as the myth of little boys who forgot to grow up.
21078|1|David Mamet, that president emeritus of hard-consonant profanity, often seems as comfortable with softer stuff as a man wearing wool in July. But this on-the-nose Hollywood satire played like Preston Sturges absolved of Production-Code limitations.
66575|1|It is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Just about any frame of the film, blown up, could make a beautiful poster for the film.
64766|1|The film doesn't confine itself to wry satire -- it's an effective action adventure and an emotional journey for its protagonist Jim.
63920|1|A darkly comic delicacy that goes straight to the heart of its messed up characters, well deserving of its subsequent rehabilitation as a New Wave gem.
63217|1|An off-beat psychological Western.
30700|0|Dreary, stagy and dull.
24135|1|Certainly uneven at times, but Terry Gilliam's surreal mood piece paints a vivid, splashy picture of gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson.
12582|1|Surprisingly capable sci-fi/monster thriller. And the soundtrack is so cool it can kill from fifty yards away.
65577|1|The characters are all weird and nothing much happens in Napoleon Dynamite, yet this droll and understated geek-comedy zings with truth.
26175|0|Pop stars continue to have bad luck in films.
63390|1|Builds cleverly as the mystery deepens, then struggles to bring it all to a conclusion.
12725|0|It would have taken a more imaginative approach and vision not within the reach of Howard and Goldsman to make the material come alive as a movie.
46891|0|It's the kind of movie made purely for acting awards, which is really unfair to audiences who deserve at least some story for their money.
17427|0|Though it panders shamelessly, it's not entirely unwelcome in a time when the PG movie is an endangered species. [DVD review included.]
26774|0|For all Faris's buoyancy, this is nowhere near as good as Legally Blonde, or all the other vaguely grrl-power teen movies it mimics.
72793|0|Despite its best intentions, there is much in We Are Marshall that holds it back from being the best it can be.
70438|1|Cinematographer Dione Beebe ... fills the screen with lavish images that constantly amaze the senses.
72613|1|One of the better Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn comedies -- not so much for the screenplay by Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon, which lacks the bite and sophistication of Adam's Rib, as for the relaxed and graceful interplay of the stars.
16510|1|"There can be no better description for Modern Times-or indeed, Chaplin's career-than the film's initial title card: ""A story of industry, of individual enterprise-humanity crusading in the pursuit of happiness."" [Blu-ray]"

62051|0|Oh, brother! Firing blanks in every direction, this tedious vehicle for two hard-to-like comedians is stillborn from the off.
60410|0|It's too bad the relentlessly conventional minds that made this movie couldn't have made the leap from sitcom to comedy.
12116|1|Best to savor The Grifters for its handsome design -- the picture looks as clean as a Hockney landscape -- and its juicy performances.
76756|0|This is simply just another in a long line of lazy comedies.
57341|1|Charming and entertaining.
24672|1|The movie has an impact that extends far beyond the walls of a movie theater - a quality shared by a distressingly few of today's releases.
22804|1|The Siege is many things at once: tense, exciting, disturbing, and thought provoking.
40447|0|This commercial bomb turned out to be Capra's swan song.
19454|0|Is it a docudrama about South Africa's post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings? Or is it love story? The problem with In My Country is that it tries to be both.
17400|1|It may be not be one of the classic examples of a Hollywood screwball comedy -- might I recommend His Girl Friday to anyone interested? -- but I Married a Witch contains enough modest laughs to satisfy couch potatoes on a chilly fall evening.
9753|1|As a film, it has something to say to everyone. As a technical achievement, it brings together two opposing worlds of American cinema.
10525|1|Storytelling is a witty, dark, and strangely satisfying experiment. It's a little bit sad, a little bit sick, and a whole lot honest.
80706|1|An explosive, highly-entertaining actioner
59971|1|Quiet City may be modest in budget and muted in its ambitions, but for anyone who imagines that truly independent American cinema is dead, this most chaste of romances is a quiet film worth shouting about.
32538|0|It's good art direction in search of an idea.
80170|1|Solondz's view of [his characters] is prickly, perhaps, but he doesn't skewer them or indict humanity.
46806|0|The constant movie references didn't make me laugh, they made me want to see other movies. Better movies.
66777|1|Few of the recent spate of porn docs offer up the truthful duality of Scott Gill's Porn Star, which examines the daydreams and hard nights of the world's most improbable sex symbol.
54150|0|Warmth and humor, Flaming Lips calling cards, are nowhere to be found.

37765|1|Send the teens to this one. See it yourself if you're in the mood for something that won't require much of you.
21074|1|A brilliant opening scene, but the political message is weak.
25517|1|A taut drama with great performances and a recipe for action and tension that modern-day thrillers could learn from.
12657|1|A tense and entertaining murder thriller about redemption and greed...
74158|0|If you're a 7-year-old, at whom the film is aimed, you'll probably have no problem with the idea of a dog being able to join a school football team. If you're a cynical old critic like me, you may feel differently.
71413|1|Who cares about overdone orchestral blasts or signpost-waving lines of dialogue when such raw, naked, painful humanity is displayed by Don Cheadle in the central role?
38031|0|Unfortunately, all the major characters have a whiff of Hollywood artifice, largely because (as has happened too often before in his career) Frankenheimer gets carried away by their verbosity.
12228|0|This is another Eastwood's deconstruction of his career, and it doesn't give anything else in the movie any room to breathe.
57636|1|Classic Van Damme. Fighting, fighting and more fighting.
12201|0|Crank works overtime to be a disreputable bit of pulp fiction, and for the first half or so it's like inhaling the cinematic equivalent of the film's title.
17358|1|[After the] headlong launch into that abstract fantasia of color and sound, it's difficult to deny the sexual nature of its characters' pelvic thrusts and rampant phallic imagery. Clearly, this is Disney's horniest animated feature.
52276|1|Maybe small town America was never this ideal and maybe nobody grew up in such a perfect family, but thanks to Andy Hardy and company we can always remember it that way.
63252|1|An American Werewolf in London, like a fine wine, just keeps getting more and more vintage.
58224|1|Its themes are couched in so much wit and silliness that it doesn't take a communist to enjoy it.
5189|1|It was Star Trek II that put the franchise on the right track as the spirit of Gene Roddenberry's 60s television series was harnessed to spectacular effect.
12948|0|Needs hosing down.
35438|1|Kubrick's second feature shows his promise as a powerful and iconic director in motifs and style.
4790|0|It professes to be good for viewers by kicking them below the knee, thereby testing their sensitivity reflexes.
27231|0|The writing is so messy and aimless that when the film retrenches to generic kid flick mediocrity, it actually counts as a relief.
75435|1|This movie isn't anything special, but it's well done and generally pleasing. It's a nice, subtle and safe romantic comedy that will please fans of the genre.
70381|1|It is the very definition of 'haunting,' in that it has a strong impact in the viewing, but an even stronger one in the contemplating.
80801|1|A compelling experience because it is true and because it is photographed with such panoramic intensity.
10345|1|Field succeeds in making Edna both fragile and tough-minded, defiant not by character or disposition but by sheer effort of will.
59962|1|Trouble the Water is a truly gobsmacking document, but it's Kimberly Roberts who carries the film.
7436|0|Faithful to the events in Barry's novel, lifts a good deal of his witty dialogue, and recruits a proven cast of laugh-winners. Why, then, is it so resolutely unfunny?
41756|1|Lumet's film of O'Neill's masterpiece is one of the most faithful and well-executed screen adaptations ever due to Boris Kaufman's landmark cinematography and superlative ensemble of Ralph Richardson, Katharine Hepburn, Jason Robards and Dean Stockwell.

62308|1|A pleasant, if predictable, tale of female empowerment ideal for the under ten set.
5908|0|At its best, Naqoyqatsi awakens the eyes, but it doesn't really do much to tweak the conscience. It's difficult to feel a sense of outrage while you're in a trance.

57030|0|It's not often you come across a film as unique as this, and while my taste for liver, lights, and sweetbreads isn't what it once was, this is still a fine post-Halloween aperitif, with guts to spare.
7014|0|It quickly plunges us into darkness as far as sense and logic are concerned.
18931|1|Has a verve and cheekiness that's partly a smart wedding of such influences as Sergio Leone, George Miller and south-of-the-border noir.
11360|1|It is the great example of Artistic Porno.

55416|1|A pure time capsule of '80s rock 'n' roll energy. Joan Jett is perfectly cast.

77031|0|It was supposed to be a comedy, but it just wasn't funny. End of story.
4988|1|It's one sign of Sautet's success that, though he presents neither character as especially admirable or exceptional, he makes us care about them a great deal.

66110|1|Fishburne, Jacob, and Branagh make Parker's version of Othello a chilling and horrific tragedy.
19936|1|Fonda is simply a revelation, beautiful, sassy and streetwise, and yet hauntingly vulnerable. She deserved her Oscar in a role she has never bettered.

65269|1|...not only a loving, teasing homage to the Romero Dead films. It's also a superb zombie film in its own right...
79610|1|The playful, quirky chemistry between Goldblum and Davis in the first half of the movie ensures that this gothic horror is heartbreaking as well as stomach-churning.
36390|1|The work of a unique, uncompromising talent at the height of his creative powers. Mouchette is difficult and depressing, but very powerful.
24925|1|...the film surely remains one of the most memorable and downright essential examples of the slow-burn thriller genre.
24678|1|Long on the Shelf, O is well directed and decently acted, but its narrative, while more or less faithful to Shakespeare, tried to do too much, pushing the characters and their emotions to unreasonable and unconvincing extremes.

64739|1|This is a fascinating debut by writer-director Pier Paolo Pasolini, who has scripted some interesting pix.
54570|1|An adequately wacky cops-and-robbers caper. Sharp dialogue and good chemistry between the actors make up for its routine plot twists.

17248|1|Exciting, large-scale, and patriotic.
74543|0|This military drama never gets moving. Just mainly posturing by all sides concerned. The screenplay was definitely missing in action. Paul Chambers, CNN.

28465|1|Duvall won an Oscar for this one, and it's still a moving and fascinating flick.
3059|1|Adaptation would all be insufferably clever-clever were its motivation not so genuine. Instead it is experimental, funny, with a tightly-repressed anger and a desire to dig out truth rather than take refuge in the usual artifice.

9171|0|Much like how Liv Tyler's beauty is softened by the affectless drone of her voice, the film's stylish flash is made less inviting by some dullness in design.
20729|0|It's a pretty dumb and utterly pretentious jumbled drama that is never sure what it's trying to say, or what in fact it means.

76425|1|Like great garage rock, however, Ulmer's landmark film ultimately derives its raw, jittery vitality from its very crudeness.
2977|1|Due specific praise is the simple look of the movie, as if a meagre budget and disrespected genre were no impediment to making a visually arresting movie.
19067|0|No more than moderately satisfying.
78333|1|Worth seeing because its odd, self-effacing subject is satisfying by reason of his very emptiness, and more than a little pathetic.
72221|0|Sexy Broadway classic gets disappointing 1980s remake.
14049|0|It's disappointing that this film doesn't really have a storyline, because the characters have a lot of potential.
471|1|A lustrous essay on the alluring trapdoors of the romantic image
20610|0|With the right material - think the day-glo campery of Hairspray - director Adam Shankman is capable of good things. Here you get the distinct impression there's not enough room to accommodate Sandler's ego.

73327|1|Paulie is a family film, and it's a good one.
52457|1|Kieslowski's film is one of the great film comedies. Sure, it's the light relief of the Three Colours trilogy, but its sharp observations about human nature are every bit as telling.
67524|1|The acting by the three stars is superb, though this is ultimately Jeanne Moreau's film.
14756|0|Painfully disengaged from anything human.
1378|1|As an anomaly, a curio, even as half a movie, it's a winner. As a stand-alone feature, it struggles to stand up to close scrutiny.
41001|1|Naive, unintentionally campy comedy about four girls, who set to Florida during spring break for some fun; Connie Francis' title song became a huge hit.
54404|1|...a black comedy ... that ultimately acquires Hitchcockian levels of suspense.
30671|1|Far less cuddly than expected, this unusual and elegant movie may have failed to connect with US audiences but it proves Spielberg is currently the most unpredictable director in Hollywood.
51040|1|As is his want, Mr. Nolan jumps between time periods and voice-overs with reckless abandon. The movie's real trick is that it all somehow manages to congeal.
29630|1|Magnolia is a mess, but it's somehow encouraging: It takes a gifted director to make a movie this extravagantly foolish.
43160|1|This comedy is content to enjoy the beguiling antics of Ms. Aniston, who is as skillful here as she is miscast, and to let its colorful minor characters give it a sitcom spin.
75370|1|Easily one of the best films of the year, and ironically, it was better than all of the Best Picture nominees.
49012|1|As the protective mother, the brilliant Tilda Swinton elevates this well-directed neo-noir way above its status as a loose remake of the 1949 Max Ophuls's Reckless Moment.
41105|1|A haunting, beautifully acted tale of impossible dreams and lost hope.
1940|1|An emotional and gripping two hours plus that rarely flags.
29548|0|You can enjoy the mild bouquet of Bottle Shock as pleasantly sparkling, but it could have been plummier. Rickman sends up a full-bodied sneering British snob.
13387|1|Baring much more than bodies, Oshima delves deeply into subconscious carnal desires under the influence of society, and the eternal human contradictions between liberating sexual impulses and erotic enslavement.
65175|1|The movie benefits greatly from Johansson's gift for understated delivery, but she's less assured in this demure, largely non-verbal role than she was as a modern young woman in Ghost World and Lost in Translation.
54027|1|The humour, the pathos, the tension - even the blooming soundtrack - all conspire to ensure that the tale of a teenager traveling back 30 years to ensure his parents meet and ultimately mate can, given its vintage, now be fairly described as a classic.
18025|1|Not particularly imaginative, but not the worst.
2578|0|A movie that makes molasses look fast.
44208|1|The one irreplaceable Christmas special.
68795|1|One of the pleasures of Le Samourai is to realize how complicated the plot has grown, in its flat, deadpan way.
68418|1|What emerges is more interesting, thankfully, than a linear offering of sporting triumph in the face of adversity.
37657|0|The ending is sublime, a set piece that almost makes up for the overwhelming slightness of it all.
18132|0|The film runs for 161 minutes and does not have a strongly defined narrative.
4829|1|An above average MGM musical, highlighted by Astaire's amazing dance on the ceiling.

80453|1|Expert film version of the play with gay subtext for days.
18574|0|For all its fabulous imagery and occasional dab-your-eyes moments, What Dreams May Come never rises to the wonderment of its own irresistible conviction -- that love can live beyond the grave.
2564|1|There is nothing whatever special here, but it adequately achieves its modest ambitions.
40969|1|Transplanted to medieval Japan, Kurosawa's brutal film is one of the best Shakesperean adaptations on screen, with a tour de force performance from Toshiro Mifune; it makes a fascinating double bill with the masterful Ran
78863|0|The Thin Man, produced way back in 1934, just isn't that funny any more.
15569|0|It's strictly a side issue whether mankind will survive colliding with an asteroid the size of Texas; the real question is whether Liv Tyler, who plays Bruce Willis's daughter, gets to keep her boyfriend.
4749|1|Strong debut from writer-director Mark Milgard.
51798|1|There isn't enough one could say about the casting in this film -- it's simply perfect. The story is elevated by the chemistry and sense of improvisation between Buscemi and Cassel.

13191|1|Those wishing to defend the honor of the red states will find much to dislike here, starting with the depiction of Southerners as rednecks and Klansmen
74649|1|Despite its structural flaws, Carandiru presents more interesting characters than you'd see in a dozen other prison movies.
28086|1|The style of filmmaking is simply too polite and serene to carry the edgy, dangerous material of Uris's novel
31838|0|Cheesy comedy that works as background visuals at a party.
28582|1|Hoffman's unfettered performance beautifully captures Wilson's sad, manic quality.
5436|1|A fitfully amusing black comedy about an alcoholic assassin, its well-drawn characters drown in a generic gangster plot and a painfully low budget.
12976|0|It may be that the truly American tale here is the spectacle of an artist squandering his awesome gifts on the way to becoming a Hollywood institution.
24194|1|Smart and stylish, it also has scenes of crackling violence and dramaturgy that oftentimes strains to work but, on the whole, Deep Cover is engaging, thoughtful and inventive.
1035|0|Frankly, this is just like a very average TV movie except the cast is more expensive and the stunning Bassett glides through with inviolable class.
16712|1|A number of the actors surprise and beguile.

15304|1|Enormously entertaining.
66096|0|If only director Nicholas Meyer had grasped the implications of his tale more fully and enthusiastically, this might have become a classic piece of cornball SF poetry, but as it stands the tepid acting and one-set claustrophobia take a heavy toll.
16305|0|...strictly amateur night.

60938|1|Basically harmless and grudgingly funny.
65506|0|Towne has a love of slow motion that's employed as if he's afraid you might miss one, rippling muscle. Worse than that, when people aren't exercising, they are often talking about exercising.

40820|1|It's an odd, charming movie, not for everyone, but definitely for Coen acolytes. A great adaptation. And buy the soundtrack.
9073|1|Right up to an ending designed to crack the sternest critical poker face, this is gourmet popcorn of the highest order.
64235|1|Director John Huston is very careful not to share any beauty with us, there's one stunning shot of swirling dust, accentuated by the golden hue, but it's far off in the distance. If the characters can't have pleasure, neither should we.
55667|1|It certainly isn't as dramatic as Titanic, and the original Poseidon Adventure is still slightly better.
45975|1|Lester has crafted here the most inventive and wildly enjoyable version of The Three Musketeers ever committed to film.
4399|0|A bland lifeless piece of science fiction fodder that really doesn't pay homage to the game.
10143|0|As far as the movie's message is considered -- if only grown-ups could be more like kids -- Jerry Lewis did an infinitely better job of plugging it in the 50s.

52392|1|Features a stellar cast of all-star MGM veterans who all know how to overact.
71108|0|Though writer/director Maggie Greenwald wraps her story around a wincingly trite yarn ... she keeps her film afloat by focusing on the music. But, when the tunes stop, so does the magic.

17219|0|A worthy but irretrievably dull homily.
26931|1|A big, colorful movie. The film is absurd, but likeable.
22965|1|It didn't move me.
48795|1|Originally released as Braindead, this gory, maccabre satire of 1950s New Zealand society is yet another proof that Peter Jackson is one of the sharpest, most skillful directors working in the genre; a good companion piece to Meet the Feebles.
16562|1|An engaging and graceful comedy
19860|1|[Don't Look Now] takes the viewer on a winding, unpredictable trip that starts as a meditation on grief and ends as a supernatural thriller.
45703|0|In reality, Venom is nothing more than the teenage slasher formula applied to the swamp.
63573|1|Sidney Lumet's direction, like David Mamet's patchy script, may not be quite good enough to justify the Rembrandt-like cinematography of Edward Pisoni and the brooding mood of self-importance, but it's good direction nonetheless.
20516|0|A jeering, dreamlike comedy with nothing much on its mind except how neat the Coen brothers are and how stupid or contemptible everybody else is, including everyone in the audience.
67775|1|Children in dire situations can be a tricky, quasi-exploitive subject for filmmakers ... but it's handled here in a responsible, occasionally joyous fashion. You can still feel your heartstrings being pulled, but when it's done this well, it's tough to be

1726|0|Rare is the film this uproariously awful.
48689|0|You probably can't blame Chow for The Corruptor. No way he could outmaneuver the director and the writers. The only thing in The Corruptor more catastrophic than the car chases is the script.
11849|0|Bring on the David Fincher-helmed remake.
15472|0|As a film in general, Uncle Nino would probably be no more than a 6 out of 10, but as a family film it merits a 7.
22482|1|Nichols' version of Carrie Fisher's memoir of a drug-addicted actress (well played by Meryl Streep), and her troubled bond with her famous mother (inspired by mom Debbie Reynolds) is sleek, shallow and sporadically entertaining.
48193|1|An amazing true story of faith and martyrdom
79952|1|Hawke and Delpy keep the tone not only afloat but mesmerizing. So natural are their performances that it seems impossible not to believe they truly are soulmates who are locked in a doomed, all-too-short affair.
31652|0|A long-on-style-short-on-insight mish-mash... the filmmakers trade on credit they haven't earned, hoping you'll fill in the narrative gaps.
72470|0|The film is further proof that revenge, even when served as a cold dish as this is, ends up being far too chewy for a satisfying movie meal
72725|1|Ransom benefits handsomely from a story that remains compellingly believable, even as the plot twists become more baroque. Be warned, though, that Ransom is a violent film, with bloody shootouts that will not be easy to watch.

58281|0|Which is scarier: Foxx, abandoned in a hick town, caught up in a botched robbery attempt; or you, trapped inside a theater, forced into watching this god-awful movie?
73850|1|This is a pinnacle of horror cinema: atmospheric, rhapsodic and -- especially in the slow-burn confrontations between Lucy and her otherworldly inamorato -- achingly transcendent.
20355|0|Big dumb fun, for sure, but not big and clever.
63748|1|There is some lovely filmmaking here, and nice surprises.
4343|0|For all the sex and vicious psychological game-playing, Chereau's movie is strangely forgettable.
16903|1|Man versus technology has been one of the staples of screen comedy since the earliest silent days, and Hughes makes the most of the format here packing as many of the frustrations of modern life as he can into this calamitous travelog of roadside America.
39935|1|By following its story as closely as they have, the filmmakers have retained much of what made the novel a classic.
23861|1|Written and directed by Patrick Stettner, it's a movie full of fascinating details and frustrating moments in which the meticulously drawn characters behave in ways that seem dictated by Stettner's plot rather than by their own personalities.
14254|1|A world at once mundane and monumental for Pier Paolo Pasolini
24601|1|Still succeeds as an all-out assault on good taste.

78498|1|This silent film adaptation of Gaston Leroux's novel is one of the classics in the history of the horror genre.
60045|0|Mediocre in every way. Memorable only because of whimsical camp value.
7557|0|Because it falls in with the undulating rhythm of the life of its heroes, for whom a fatal fight and a quiet night have almost equal importance, the picture never manages to reach the peaks of satisfying Hollywood melodrama.
1131|0|There's no disguising the fact that, beneath all its talk, this is a very traditional, very predictable romance; it's sorely in need of some comic relief.
35939|0|The whole movie is overbright, overloud, antic, telling us the characters and animals are endearing rather than allowing them to reveal themselves as such.
78938|0|Deliberately Louisville-slugs its audience over the head.

7098|0|The Village is not completely awful, but it comes closer than one would like to admit.
12532|0|This film is strictly hit and miss.
997|1|Wes Anderson transports his arch, pristine, melancholic sensibility to India, where three estranged brothers meet after their father's death and hop a train in a quixotic attempt to heal their spiritual wounds.
28217|1|Beowulf is a well conceived and technically excellent rendition of the ancient legend, but it doesn't follow its ideas through all the way, and some strange choices on the part of Zemeckis ultimately make it a little less than the sum of its parts.

11073|1|Teens may enjoy this exceptional, exciting drama.

9723|1|For those like me who are outside but sympathetic to the faith, it looks like another handsomely made, good-natured and high-spirited family movie, which is dramatically stymied through being locked within school grounds.
61798|1|Its main surprise is the compassion shown toward everyone, on all sides of the debate. It does not vilify those who vilify gays.
23813|1|The implication is that there are hundreds, maybe thousands of guys like Tom Powers, little criminals living fast and dying hard.
2179|1|Notorious is a tribute the rapper's contribution to pop culture.
15844|1|Wendy might have a bizarre sense of locale and idolatry, but the imagination of the filmmakers is just enough to help swallow their incredibly condescending posturing.
52136|0|The actor's voices may suit animated television characters, but on a large screen Kevin Conroy's Batman, Mark Hamill's Joker, and Dana Delany's Andrea sound flat and one-dimensional.

26316|1|Armchair dentistry! Ouch!
16118|0|The script just doesn't have enough comic moments to fill its 90-minute running time.

38961|1|Bland-but-sweet dramedy more for adult palates.
3077|1|Funny, disturbing, tragic and deeply addictive.
18874|0|It's vaguely interesting, but vagueness isn't a big turn-on for most audiences. You keep wishing The Walker would break into an extended run in some direction. But instead it merely meanders.

70345|0|Without a Paddle is a sloppy effort, yet even a clich√©d comedy could be fun if it actually delivered on laughs.
41091|0|"Soul searching is rarely a thrill a minute but it's rarely as tedious as this. ...Oscar-bait it may be, but ""The Sheltering Sky"" is more deserving of the First Annual Chicken Little Award."
3929|0|Why did Soderbergh want to remake an old film noir, anyway? Take out the crime elements and flesh out the human elements here, and you have a more interesting movie, I think.
7997|0|Everything comes to a head in a touchy-feely climax (if you catch our drift) where, ironically, it isn't the strong sex but all the singing and handholding that's the real turn-off.
25129|0|But the folks who made 10,000 B.C. have filled their film with a sub-Disney plot and inserted a few measly slivers of action that hardly warrant all the mystical hubbub and romantic angst.
14042|1|It goes downhill once Jack Palance exits, but the early scenes are still worth it.
16551|1|It's an assembly of sensational moments, strung together by a plot that provides the excuses for amazing stunts, and not much else. But then not much else is needed.
6198|0|Bradbury-inspired time-travel sci-fi flick is bad, boring and bland -- in every possible way.

4213|0|The story idea is an interesting one, but it doesn't quite pan out in the end. There are too many unanswered questions and unresolved conflicts.
71223|1|Sadly, while Juno may be able to carry a big bun in her oven, this film can't quite bear the heavy burden of expectation so well.
76607|0|A great deal of silent era slapstick has only grown better with age. The exploits of Mr. Bean have vinegared.

53433|1|Roger Vadim's ultra-kitsch sci-fi classic somehow improves with age.
21539|1|Van Sant's least 'show-offy', most personal, best picture in years (maybe ever), and an honourable attempt at respectfully considering the unbearable.
39295|1|Del Toro conjures up a delightfully potent atmosphere and motion for it, born no doubt of a real appreciation for such things.
57262|1|The Fly is almost unique for a horror movie in that it compels us sympathize with and root for the characters.
11766|1|Whipping along at speed, with elaborate camera movements and rousing speeches, this knows how to engage a crowd. It's corny, of course, but a guilty pleasure: romantic, diverting, with mildly amusing modern gags.
15408|0|The wondrous opening sequence was better than any Bond film, and things were looking up until the characters started talking.
19306|1|This somewhat autobiographical piece goes heavy on the melodrama and employs humor in short bursts.

21017|1|The Simpsons Movie gives us much of what we love about the characters, and if there is not enough of some of them, there is something of most of them.
5347|1|A reasonably intelligent adult comedy.
43145|1|Still entertaining in spite of its number of faults.
13022|1|It's a Styrofoam-cup comedy, lightweight and disposable, but this G-rated fantasy of suburban family life is a good bet for its intended audience of 12-year-olds and younger.
33235|1|It's a languorous and uncompromising work that will drive some to distraction, but also a movie of dark, still beauty that will have others weeping tears of pure, noir joy.
19815|0|What's going on is sort of confused.
75150|1|The heart of Sington's film is the dry humour and boundless humility of his interviewees.

18343|1|This delightfully funny and smart family film certainly lives up to its title.
46637|0|Heartfelt and intolerable
38639|1|Stillman's film depends on strong dialogue and language, his humor is submerged in the text and is played deadpan by his actors; no wonder some critics have compared him to the Gallic Eric Rohmer

47771|1|The pinnacle of Godard's art. Probing, uncertain, hesitant, humble, lyrical and profound
21263|1|A screen version of such a book is a bold project, but Darryl Zanuck as producer and John Ford as director have succeeded in capturing to a remarkable degree the atmosphere of the novel.

63158|1|The fine performances by Blanc and Melki give Belvaux' whole clever undertaking some needed weight.
76060|1|It's a throwback to the days when horror movies often had a certain visual grandeur. And while one may miss a modern frisson or two, there's still a great deal of dreadful beauty to relish.

20811|1|"Joins the likes of ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""Duel"" as a nightmare that simply will not end."
12880|1|It's presented with Lee's usual intelligence and clarity as he skilfully mixes politics with moving reminders of the lives it affects.
45598|1|A middle of the road drama that has a lot going for it in certain key areas.
65639|0|Performed to the hilt by Flanery and filmed with conviction by Victor Salva, the movie is finally too solemn to survive its pushy musical strings.

1214|1|It has enough cute cowboys, shoot-outs, and romance to remind us how much we've missed seeing westerns.

64219|1|Vet French actor Michel Bouquet renders an astonishing performance in this intriguing family drama.
71263|0|Jacob's Ladder is the nightmare as Rube Goldberg machine. Lyne bombards us with omens and portents, but they aren't rooted in anything, and so the audience remains in a state of arbitrary, floating anxiety.

55364|1|"""Prince of the City'' begins with the strength and confidence of a great film, and ends merely as a good one. The achievement isn't what it first promises to be, but it's exciting and impressive all the same."
17143|1|Even though the story almost makes no sense and the Oscar-winning editing has several illogical cuts, Bullitt is an exquisitely satisfying motion picture, particularly if there is still an adolescent boy lodged somewhere in your psyche.
45031|1|Rousing bicycle race story is a family favorite.
8215|1|It may be corny, but you'd have to be a real cynic not to be drawn in.

51639|1|Demonstrates why Mel Gibson is a movie star: He can take mediocre material and through sheer willpower -- not to mention oodles of charm -- make it work.
77386|1|The dancing here brings out the sensual dreaminess of the songs. Dirty Dancing -- what a great title! -- is such a bubbleheaded, retro vision of growing up in the sixties (or any other time) that you go out of the theatre giggling happily.
49000|1|Roger Moore has crumpled his comic-strip good looks into something approaching world-weariness, and the newfound maturity in his expression is reflected in director John Glen's style, which goes for the measured and elegant over the flashy and excessive.
71208|0|[A] gory, off-putting musical, which tries to combine Gothic rock stylings with the grotesque sensibilities of so-called, 'torture-porn' horror-thrillers.
7909|1|Ponderously long, yes; but it was and still is a true movie event.
29956|1|Pugilism and Freud
70806|0|Could stand to lose at least 21 minutes-the film implodes under the somber weight of its own pretentiousness
39727|1|"A baker's dozen of books featuring the character of Ezekiel ""Easy"" Rawlins were penned by author Walter Mosley, and it's a shame the box office failure of Devil in a Blue Dress prevented any more mysteries from making the leap from page to screen."
22347|1|A baroque masterpiece by Max Ophuls, his last film (1955) and his only work in color and wide-screen.
70969|0|The first episode builds an effective mood through its elliptical action and long, slow tracks through empty rooms, but this 1965 film soon levels off into academic stylization.
28710|0|Musically ... the Rugrats sequel is a big step backward.
13042|1|A wonderful performance from Diane Keaton pulls the movie through.
4156|1|Dunaway creates the benchmark for harridans the world over but never entirely loses sympathy for her subject. It's a constant blast of high melodrama and camp.
3107|0|Strictly for viewers who don't want surprises, just a laundry list of buddyisms.
3259|1|Check your brain at the door and giggle your butt off.
44224|0|"From the fluttering flags to James Horner's shamelessly manipulative music, this is more like a patriotic ""Heritage Moment"" than a film about actual people."
78701|0|The Young Black Stallion is not so much a bad film as it is a non film. It was meant mainly to be looked at.
47064|1|There's genuine emotion in this movie, and wide-ranging ones at that. There's the shock of loss, the struggle in moving forward, the fear of failure and the joy of putting one's passion into a good cause, regardless of the results.
75550|1|Egoyan's masterpiece -- a twisting tale of erotic obsession and hypnotic storytelling.
66495|1|Ultimately, each passing minute equates to another cruel twist of the knife, and the audience cannot help but be riveted.
69830|1|This is moviemaking that honors the craftsmanship of its subject.
66382|1|While it might not seem so on the surface to those weaned on Why We Fight and, conversely, The Eternal Jew, 49th Parallel is wholly valid as propaganda.
39011|1|Very funny, Well worth a look
32369|1|Kurosawa grounds this downward spiral through the presence of Toshiro Mifune, who personalizes the Macbeth role while making it greater than his historical moment.
62891|1|A superior wildlife film, featuring such breathtaking images of wild birds in flight that the audience is constantly wondering 'how in the world did they get that shot?'
29697|0|A preachy and manipulative tearjerkering melodrama that mishandles its pseudo-emotional longwindedness. Goldberg and Liotta derved better than this punctuated pap
19949|1|An exciting film noir entry, steaming up the screen with sultry, sexy Russell and a somnambulistic Mitchum who manage to clinch often, despite their sneering disregard for each other.
70173|0|"""The One"" is an expensive-looking martial arts-science fiction movie that delivers a lot less than you would expect from it."
73899|1|Proves compelling enough to give meaning to the whole as a successful experiment and stylization, if predictable and sentimental.
24873|1|Have the movies ever talked this quickly, before or since?
2178|1|Fluffy, good-natured, endlessly quotable fun, just like you remember it.
10400|0|...feels as if it has been manufactured in a chop shop of former Oscar winners and nauseating Miramax 'prestige' puff pieces.
38691|1|Wellman knew to keep this story short -- it runs just 73 minutes -- and speedy. And yet he understands how to conduct it so that it's more than just breakneck comedy.
27823|1|A superb documentary that delves into the science, emotions and danger surrounding the handful of men and women who risk their lives searching for the ultimate thrill.
3252|1|For those who are willing to go the distance with Lynch, the return trip to Twin Peaks is well worth the trouble.
27257|1|Terrific family fun.
61302|0|He fails as often as he succeeds. With so many loose ends, you could make a pretty rag rug.
19869|1|The brilliance of Southland Tales is inextricable from its flaws, if indeed they are flaws.
77261|0|Slack storytelling and an unsatisfying ending make this the weakest picture in the Poe-Corman-Price series.
19657|0|What a disappointment! The greatest fantasy novels and films are products of the unconscious - they have the authority of visions, glimpsed though imperfectly understood. But the creators of MirrorMask remain all too wide awake.
22701|1|simple narrative penetrates the complications arising from adultery with far more discernment than any film I can recall
72373|1|It may not have the epic scope and complexity of Forrest Gump, but Breakfast on Pluto a small gem.
78294|0|With cheesy special effects (even the volcano isn't convincing, considering the film cost $20 million) and a hole-ridden script, this film offers precious little to like.
75596|1|That Triumph of the Will is a great propaganda film, there is no doubt, and various surveys have named it so. But I doubt that anyone not already a Nazi could be swayed by it.
34960|1|an enjoyably stylish entry in the French crime film tradition, but a decidedly minor one
78676|0|Nihilistic, amoral, self-congratulatory wanking.
34633|1|Brilliantly acted, superbly directed and beautifully shot, this is a gripping drama that really gets under your skin and marks writer-director Jeff Nichols out as a talent to watch.
2719|0|...Berg's listless direction brings the film so little point of view that it doesn't much matter who lives or dies.
74084|1|Stagey yes, but powerful Tracy and March acting + subject matter make this a must see.
35231|1|The film corners you with the ferocity of a Spanish inquisitor with a branding iron and holds you there to the bitter end.
10559|0|I'm sure Chereau meant this to be a searing portrait of psychic distance, and it certainly is bleak. What it is not, unfortunately, is riveting cinema.
61920|0|They ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering.
3351|0|It's an achievement so hermetic it hardly bothers to be a movie.
78760|0|Likeable enough, and even amusing for stretches, but ultimately too generic for a recommendation. [Blu-ray]
25270|0|Maid In Manhattan ultimately leaves nothing whatsoever for the viewer to grasp. . .leaving another dead carcass of Hollywood convention packed away and frozen for reheating by audiences who can find nothing else in the cupboard to eat.
18692|1|Road Trip is a one-way trip to immature comic bliss.
43159|1|A surprisingly 'post-9/11' movie, it combines typical stoner humor with a plot about ethnic profiling, torture, and War on Terror paranoia. But, like, in a funny way.
27286|1|A very tough, very real film, anchored by the memorable work of the two leads.
158|0|Reflects the mentality of great swaths of artless, ignorant slobs.
56720|0|No one gets away unscathed in Robert Towne's overblown attempt at transfiguring John Fante's novel to film.
15784|0|The film makers haven't listened to Wright. They appear to have been aiming at the same genteel audience that insists on seeing something sentimental and upbeat even in a television movie-of-the-week about AIDS.
8298|0|It's exactly like the comic strip that inspired it: colorless, inoffensive, and wholly forgettable.
18536|1|An entrancing, entirely satisfying piece of work.
19795|0|A pretentious, preachy first movie from an arguably great filmmaker.
16153|0|The cops never seem to know what they're doing, but then neither do the filmmakers, though I can't imagine that casual audiences will care since there are plenty of big explosions at the end to reward them.
2747|1|It's impossible to keep the Simpsons down. Even during those draggy parts, you need to stay alert: You never know when the film's 11 credited screenwriters will unleash another zinger.
56714|0|It's embarrassing to see Lauren Holly wasting her time as the butt-of-all-the-obvious-jokes female aboard ship.
51963|1|An unusual subject to get the Hollywood treatment though, and as such it should be commended, while Hemmingway is always worth catching.
7923|0|Tyler Perry still hasn't found the formula for combining comedy and drama
40148|1|The human element is just as prescient as it was then, while the characters' romantic/professional entanglements now have the added poignancy of the past tense.
16366|1|It covers some serious topics about adolescence, but it does it with a wink and a knowing nod; some things that are tragic when you're 14 are quite funny in hindsight.
55766|1|Washington's swaggering, larger-than-life portrayal dominates the film in a towering performance that may well win him another Oscar nomination.
43731|0|Tasteless? Oh, yeah.
57127|0|Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver is a pale shadow of the entertaining 1997 family movie. It's a sequel that lacks the spirit and sweetness of the original.

48996|1|A brooding, smoldering study of sexual intensity grittily realized by McGregor, Swinton, and Mullan who slip, almost unnoticed, into these roles and make them their own.
33274|0|By the book buddy-buddy movie. This is a weakly scripted parade of set-pieces which aren't as exciting as regular Jackie Chan films.
19279|1|Zany character portrayal of two lonely thirtysomething misfits who are opposites but nevertheless find romance together despite many obstacles in their path.
27838|1|A rather entertaining (if style-over-substance) portrait of insane illicitness.

30947|1|...a very good thriller that could've (and should've) been a great one...
16369|0|Thankfully, Puccini for Beginners isn't quite as exploitative as you might expect for a movie about a bisexual love triangle. But that's about all the credit this flat-footed, would-be screwball comedy gets.
42658|0|A syrupy serving of Freudian analysis that looks tempting but tastes of too much superego, id, and subconscious jive to be taken seriously.
68004|1|Alfred Hitchcock's first Hollywood film is a sumptuous and suspenseful adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's romantic novel.
71406|1|A product of inestimable patience, the elegant and controlled Spider requires and rewards the same. It is a story of re-entry, following the downward fluttering trajectory of an ordinary, pitiable monster ...

80787|1|Pleasing in an old-fashioned way.

8412|1|The film gives Ali his due by refusing to idealize him or to gloss over his failings.
15249|1|Not a superficial music video but a smart and compassionate dissection of superficiality, and of the alternating joys and disillusionments experienced by its audience.
25911|0|Very mildly entertaining. Not even worth watching a second time, but it worked as a Saturday matinee.
14174|0|Clark's CGI-induced rugrat romp is about as inspiring in its hilarity as a diaper rash. Exceedingly nonsensical and...excuse the intended pun-infantile
24100|0|a very strange and maddening movie, being a fascinating tale that's nowhere as provocative as it first promises to be and as the reputations of everyone connected with it might lead you to expect.
32301|1|It's ridiculous, of course, but the combination of classic monsters, dizzy sets and some of Bud and Lou's funniest bits make it a keeper.
12741|0|Brainless, explosion-happy action ('80s style).

11266|1|Hardly The Remains of the Day, but some would claim it's more fun.
43211|1|Sharply uneven, this teen-angst feature begins exgremely well with some relevant social commentary; it also put on the map Christian Slater as a talent to watch.

42224|0|Watching the talented cast in Crash hurl venomous racial invective in their interlocking dramas may give the film a consistently charged atmosphere, but it's ultimately no more insightful than an hour of talk radio.
16108|1|What makes The Inheritance so watchable, and so different from recent couples dramas like Closer, is that these privileged people are decent, likable and struggling to do the right thing.
79148|1|This movie confirms Trey Parker as the Orson Welles of absurd comedy.
65353|1|Bizarre, fascinating political assassination satire with superb cast
4957|1|Perhaps even smarter than the original as it expands the potential for the surreal and ties up all the loose ends, managing, quite remarkably, to give its own pointlessness a purpose.
48580|0|...a hopelessly dated relic of the early 1980s...
53690|0|Ira & Abby is like its characters: nice with a lot of problems.
21947|1|Appealing gentle Western comedy.
13598|1|Devane and Jones are outstanding. Their characters are as numb as scar tissue, emasculated by peace and alienated by an ashamed and horrified society. The folly of the Vietnam War permeates every frame.
18780|1|There are plenty of impressive gunfights and some wicked martial arts sequences here, but the film is most likely to be remembered for its emphasis on free running, a dizzying physical technique in which the cast sprint, leap and roll through the city.
21785|0|As dull as a conversation with a corpse.
76462|1|A floatingly delightful fairytale with its heart set on repealing the law of gravity.
6992|1|Despite channeling Dickensian melodrama, first-time director Andrei Kravchuk skilfully avoids wallowing in sentimentality.
59036|1|Connery has a ball with great stunts, snappy dialogue and a bevy of typically Bondish beauties.
10281|0|Messages, as Sam Goldwyn famously advised, are better left to Western Union.
11208|1|Jeffs makes a good fist of the direction and Blunt proves that she can do comedy, but it's Adams's comforting, charismatic central turn which really gives the film its lift.
14804|1|Mesmerisingly tacky crime film about evildoing in a Midwester meat empire that could only have been made by people who never set foot in Kansas.
40348|1|George C. Scott makes for such an unstoppably watchable Patton that... he makes every single onscreen moment feels like the most vital thing you have ever seen in a movie.
45387|1|The intimate, idiosyncratic and very funny Buffalo '66 --directed by and starring Vincent Gallo, from a semi-autobiographical script co-authored with Alison Bagnall --feels like a projection of Gallo's very psyche.
21955|0|The Jazz Singer has so many things wrong with it that a review threatens to become a list.
31608|1|The film does an amazingly good job of doing of leading many to believe that Presley could have been an inspired actor had he not been steered down the river by Hal Wallis and Colonel Tom Parker.

2618|1|Leigh takes time to show us the daily lives of all characters, giving them more reality than a Hollywood film would think necessary.
21818|0|Unfortunately, this sweet and homey picture which casts two very decent actors (Sally Field and James Garner) in two very decent roles, falls far short of compelling filmmaking.
21543|1|It's not in the same league as Sideways but it has a fragrant sense of the beauty of wine and winemaking, not just the drinking.
63646|0|A woefully unfunny, insider Hollywood yarn that allows Joe Pesci to yammer obnoxiously for two hours.
23452|0|It's larger-than life, wild, dizzy, colourful and vulgar, and goes round in circles - for a very long time.
71374|0|Tom Holland directed from a script and story credited to three individuals, anyone could have knocked this one out during coffee break.
50851|0|What's especially lamentable is that this movie strands yet another exemplary turn by Edward Norton, who once again is superior to the material surrounding him.
9842|0|There are some jokes here, and any of these situations could have been funny as skits. Taken together, they're incoherent.
53148|1|All of the cast nicely complement Watson, as it is her movie, and watching her is a real treat.
22592|0|Out of gas, full of celebs.
20492|0|By the end of the film we also expect some closure; satisfaction in knowing that the Gromberg family is going to be okay. This conclusion never comes and we are left wondering whether the family will indeed persevere.
41234|1|[Lemmon's character is] a whingeing, self-pitying figure who, like other Wilder practitioners, cannot recognise the extent of his turpitude, and this is both the strength and weakness of a remarkable movie.
49828|0|Droll, relatively lifeless.
22381|0|As a human interest drama, Red Planet is more thin than Mars' atmosphere.

38533|1|A cool and atmospheric gangster film. It may not be particularly memorable, but it is fun to watch.
22678|1|"Capra's political parable is problematic parables, from his contradictory approach to the ""little people"" to the right-wing elements to the compromised ending, in which Cooper is stopped from committing suicide."
7583|1|The animation, with its dimensional verisimilitude, is beguiling and the whole package ends with a noncloying dash of uplift.
42843|1|Hirokazu dwells on the resiliency of children, a theme that also resonated in Small Change and which gives the film a lightness not inherent in the subject matter.
25241|0|If Darkness confused you, you'll be completely baffled by The Nameless
31548|0|Easily one of the most gimmicky films of all time ...

50287|1|"Like ""Rushmore"" with a female slant, ""Ghost World"" tackles the true torches we often keep to ourselves as well as the struggle of feeling like a specter, or, as Enid says, as though ""everyone's too stupid to realize you."""

21400|1|It may not resemble reality in any way, but it's certainly romantic.
15177|1|Dance sequences, both in the studio and in performance, make up the symbolic and potent thrust of this enjoyable yet confined movie.
16290|0|Rodman is more fun to watch here than either co-star, given his array of earrings and nose rings, plus hair that changes color more frequently than the first lady changes her do.
7316|1|It hurts so good. Mike, Cro, Tom, we need you...
31030|1|Something for everyone. A masterpiece, and with Kurosawa that's really saying something.

6671|1|Land of Plenty isn't for everyone, but patient viewers will be rewarded with a poignant look at life in America today.
2538|1|It's a Mel Brooks kind of Jewish joke film made by gentiles.
48388|0|What is Ed Burns up to?
27088|1|An insightful essay on sexual politics. As Rowlands delicately crosses the line of sanity, it becomes apparent that imposed social roles are the cause.
33847|1|The focus is solely on the internalized motives of these characters. Despite this, Stalker remains a lucidly visual film.
13063|1|Alternately funny and scary, 'Baghead' suggests that 'The Blair Witch Project' may be as responsible for mumblecore as any of the self-consciously anti-commercial movies that usually are credited with jump-starting the trend.
5255|1|...There are no hidden messages or deep symbolic meanings to ponder.
50749|1|Son of the Bride is slight fare, but it does have it poignancies, and it is well-acted and sweet without being cloying.
7057|1|What a never-to-be-forgotten brief holiday it was, befitting one of filmdom's true regal princesses.

39916|0|A South Central LA comedy with more of the flavor of Halloween, the film is more about ghetto strife that's just too agitated to, well, pause for Claus.
44291|1|"Another Woody Allen's ""Amarcord"" - warm, rueful, poignant and hilarious."
79368|0|The film fails to offer even the barest social context for its material.
78113|0|Wicker Park is one of those maddening movies in which the characters do incredibly stupid things simply for the sake of plot contrivance, and everyone's problems would be solved if they simply picked up their cell phones.
48722|0|You'll still come away from Hearts in Atlantis wanting to read the book, but had Hicks and Goldman got it right, you would've run straight from the cinema to buy it.
76534|1|A film of visual awe, but it's not much of a human story. Close Encounters is a terrific bit of imagineering, but ultimately is a minor work in the Spielberg filmography.

9512|0|... it never quite distinguishes itself.
13560|0|While it's endearing and occasionally inspired, it's just not funny enough.
28445|1|Keaton is fabulous in roles like this, where she plays the nervous, infectiously-spastic independent woman who has needs, particularly when they are written with equal parts gushy sweetness and savage wit by Nancy Meyers
41183|1|An amazing, provocative and ultimately creepy film.
71196|1|Ralph Nelson's melodrama is best known for featuring the Oscar-winning performance of Sidney Poitier, the first black actor to win the male lead award.
6597|1|The film, like its flabby aspiring marathon runner protagonist, feels shapeless and exhausted from the sheer effort of trying to please audiences.
32195|1|Diva remains terrific after all this time. The visuals are beautifully composed; the action scenes ... still work; and the performances are all spot-on... .

23476|1|Burton, once an animator at Disney, understands that to go deeper, you must fly higher, to liberation from plot into poetry. Here he's done it. This Batman soars.
66625|1|It is possibly the best-known erotic film of modern times, perhaps the best.
12247|0|There's nary a laugh to be found in this relentlessly idiotic parody of popular romantic comedies, which manages the difficult feat of seeming overlong at just 80 minutes.

1245|1|"An often amusing parody that more closely resembles ""Hogan's Heroes"" than ""Life is Beautiful."""
5664|1|There's no moment of release, no instant of sudden redemption in this powerful, moving, and altogether devastating film.
44622|0|A product of the sort of steely, soulless competence that marks so very many films as the work of professionals who view this as a job, not an art form.
14672|1|This masterpiece still packs a wallop, though nothing in it is as simple as it may first appear; audiences are still arguing about the final sequence, which has been characterized as everything from a sentimental cop-out to the ultimate cynical twist.
18684|0|Indistiguishable from either the horror or action product that routinely comes out of the straight-to-video pipeline.
49646|0|None of the film is as funny or clever as Cates and screenwriters Ron Marasco and Michael Goorjian ... seem to think.
35416|0|I don't think my negative reaction is a case of a parent forgetting the sort of mindless entertainment that he himself enjoyed as a child; rather the turtle fights are more depressing than joyful.
82039|0|Throughout the movie, De Niro scowls and looks as if something smells bad -- and something does. It's the script.
33658|0|Made of Honor is like a paint-by-the numbers exercise in filmmaking, sealed with a misogynistic lacquer.
75866|1|A message film to please all ages.

54025|1|Raucous, outrageously funny, and filled with many zany scenes.
53890|1|A heartfelt, crowd-pleaser of a story.
71304|1|Though the controversial Korean filmmaker's latest effort is not for all tastes, it offers gorgeous imagery, effective performances, and an increasingly unsettling sense of foreboding.

19148|1|The movie is not going to bring many new fans to the following, but hey -- it gots colour, speed and sparks.
27036|1|It's easy to end a movie with 'I love you,' but it's hard to get there honestly.
5630|1|Isn't for every taste, but those tuned into Clay's goofy personality are rewarded with a hilarious performance that finds the comedian at his most confidant and playfully mischievous.
75818|1|Welcomed doses of slapstick and winking humor are sprinkled throughout rescuing the film from the occasionally heavy but never overbearing exposition.
9554|1|Taxidermia is a brilliant, often grotesquely bizarre allegory on life in Hungary from World War II to the present, a surrealist fantasy exploring the limits of the body and its desires and altogether a darkly funny comedy.

64276|1|Demme masterfully exhibits both the harsh realities of the time with the unexplainable mystical world that settles in and around them like a fog, even if he has trouble making the two elements mesh.
11334|0|Sometimes it seems a director tries to pack in as much harsh footage as an R-rating will allow for its own sake. That itself is a violent act. The audience is the victim.
70859|1|Over the years I've seen Jenna Jameson do lot of things in a lot of movies, but I'm pretty sure this is the first time I've ever seen her reading Nietzsche.

33892|1|Inspiring sports film about a real life underdog.
31998|1|Despite the snags, De Palma remains a virtuoso puppet-master, pulling the strings taut in a nail-biting robbery sequence, switching from micro to macro with Hitchcockian panache, and finally letting rip with a hell-for-leather climax.
33036|0|...everything about the movie is a little out-of-it, and not just because it's been lying on the studio shelf for a couple of years.
33349|0|[The film] shifts in tone that are too stark, scenes that are too dark, sex that is too explicit and a violent fist-fight showdown that becomes more of a letdown.
17062|1|Every once in a rare while a film comes along that works in all departments, with story, production and performance so well blended that the end effect is one of nearly complete satisfaction. Such is The Manchurian Candidate.
68726|1|Mr. Bean's Holiday delivers some of the charm of the original series, and whatever it may lack, it is worth watching simply for Rowan Atkinson's dedicated performance.
4350|1|The master class in piquant flash tends to Hollywood's warts like sumptuous flowers
65618|0|The movie doesn't exhibit the slightest attempt to be consistent, logical or sensible in anything, and there are scenes so pointless and unmotivated that attentive audiences will ask what they're doing in the movie.
15325|1|Newman gives an excellent performance, assisted by a terriffic supporting cast, including George Kennedy, outstanding as the unofficial leader of the cons who yields first place to Newman.
56471|1|Bresson examines actions but offers little attention to motives, an approach that here seems to suggest that Michel's choices may be a mystery even to himself.
910|1|Fun popcorn entertainment, thanks in no small part to the always-likable Bullock.
75587|0|Dumb and Dumberer's problems are many, but, first and foremost, it's a prequel.
66073|1|Dumb, dumb story but wonderful performers.
19614|1|Mind-blowingly great.
55306|1|An uneasy, sometimes difficult film to watch - rare at the movies these days. But as a study in pedophilia, there is plenty to be said for the conversation it ignites.
25016|0|Revulsion can be an effective tool in exposing wrongdoing. But in the murky confrontation between militant Islam and the West, truth will always be the better road to freedom.
59005|1|Assuming the shape of an old-fashioned indie, this offbeat romantic fable is a minor work that promises better things from its director; the narrative is considerably elevated by lead performers Jason Patric and the endlessly creative Samantha Morton.

55583|1|Another in a long line of ultra-violent war movies, this one is not quite what it could have been as a film, but the story and theme make up for it.
16777|0|It just doesn't flow, giving the feel of too many writers and/or directors.

61892|1|Pump Up The Volume is well worth a look.
9534|1|The movie also has its heart in the right place and it is as earnest as it can be. It simply falls short of being a great movie.

66446|0|Rafelson shows that he can't handle noir themes as easily as the real masters of the genre.
2309|0|There is no redemption, no surcease, and as the film ends the barbarity continues. This film made me intensely uncomfortable, but that was its intention.
76283|0|Mostly disappointing results.
15296|1|Harrowing and compelling screen adaptation of Thomas Hardy's novel set in 19th century England
55652|1|The film's sexy romanticism and its tragic sense of Korean history will thrill even those who have never set foot in an art gallery.
12361|0|The jarring jumps between disconnected stories and watered-down sensationalism make for a soggy experience.
7987|0|My guess is that the conceit was meant to be that Denzel's a bad guy, and that's fun to watch. Instead, this just adds another to his list of bad film's he's acted in...
44103|1|A clever and satisfying comedy that comes as a blissful relief from more high-minded festival fare.
5158|1|The film is warm, whimsical, tender, and genuinely heartfelt.
35531|1|Absorbing character-based drama that yields plenty of nuances and variations on its simple premise.
13453|0|How does Armageddon, a movie obsessed with countdowns and countdown clocks, manage to redefine -- downward -- the standard for summer stupidity? Let me count the ways.
48678|0|This inconsequential suspense yarn brings little to the table and concludes with an unsatisfying ending -- which was more silly than tense.

15871|0|By attempting to combine elements of mystery, adventure, action and romance, 'The Beach' becomes too jumbled to follow with much interest.
2638|1|...an almost documentary truth to the performances, a un-movieish consistency of tone that makes it easy to forget that we're watching actors.

14020|0|Hogan gave better performances in the ring
1175|0|This movie isn't about logic, faith or family, and doesn't have many laughs except when baboons carry things -- that's always funny. It's just mindless summer popcorn.

79278|0|Though its romantic-comedy triangle borrows heavily from Cyrano de Bergerac, the film has more in common with Three's Company.

2848|1|WWII dramedy is a true American classic.
57343|1|Belle is equally good, proving that she's a real movie star in the making - there's a sort of feral energy to Rose that's genuinely scary and disturbingly unpredictable.
11216|1|There is hardly a composition in the film that couldn't be extracted and framed.

44219|1|The performances are solid throughout, and the writing is straightforward and tight.
3452|1|I was confused and discomfited by Bad Guy , but I loved it too.
1808|1|This thriller gives you an entertaining run for your money and some offbeat frissons along the way.

44788|1|The teenage wasteland, 1976-style, of Dazed and Confused is smack-dab between The Brady Bunch and Children of the Damned , and it's a scary, if sometimes giddily amusing, place to visit.
27066|0|predictable formula film that is quickly forgotten
23976|1|Beneath the neorealist fa√ßade simmers an intensity that is far more lurid and operatic in nature.

9067|1|"Despite being heavy-handed and pretentious, and never providing a satisfying conclusion, Gabriel Range's fake-umentary ""Death of a President"" is nevertheless brilliant in its conception and execution."
19645|1|The characters all seem to have known each other for years, referring to long-held grudges and resentments that only gradually are revealed to the audience. They're a seedy, petty, dangerous and delightful bunch.
29785|1|Garbo gives her most accomplished and touching performance in Cukor's 1937 version of Camille; Robert Taylor is good too as her younger lover.
76000|0|Utterly devoid of energy and shock value.
15641|1|Small children may be afraid of some of the bad characters -- the Disney Studio's gift for creating really nasty bad guys means that they are scary -- but they will love the cute, brave mice and cheer their triumphs. Adults will enjoy the wit and style.
11817|1|This large-scale Disney family film is sheer delight.
38062|1|It's a remarkable drama...
38902|1|[Stealing] the show is the eight-year-old Philipchuk, whose wide eyes register awe, puzzlement and misery with a conviction not seen since Salvatore Cascio in Cinema Paradiso.
62739|1|The naivete of some of the film's thinking is trumped by the virtue that it's thinking at all, and that it asks us to do likewise.
20219|1|How do you follow-up Pink Flamingos? Not with a work that tries to outdo that classic gross-out comedy, but rather by moving in another direction entirely that's just as subversive, if not more so.
45813|1|Kramer vs. Kramer is definitely a movie to watch together -- your kids may well seek shelter under your arm, glad to know their own families enjoy more peace.
51024|1|A heart-stopping horror melodrama with excellent acting from all involved.
57510|1|Black's tactics are heavy-handed, but her ability to efficiently organize the complex material at hand and capture telling imagery makes Life and Debt an equally elegant and vitriolic diatribe.
39688|1|A broad, ribald circus flagrantly in love with the English language, The Tailor bustles with swaggering, jubilant showmanship.
438|0|Yes, it's so awful it's almost good. Here is the birth of camp in cinema.
35181|1|A deeply moving film.
30245|1|After all, it's not every day that one encounters a sensitive tale of sisterhood that also contains an element of cannibalism. For that alone, the movie deserves respect.
80291|0|This film, one of the worst of 2006, almost has to be seen to be believed -- a comedy about a man who goes to Iraq, and, amid a string of comic misadventures, tries to save the life of his love, who has been gravely wounded in a bombing.
56250|0|The aliens make it so plainly obvious to their intentions that it'd be ridiculous not to notice what was happening with their landing on Earth...

19322|1|Reminiscent of a Shakespearean comedy and seems to tap into a romantic yearning that is hardwired into our DNA. Absolutely sublime.
14703|0|Though Moving McAllister's heart and soul are in the right place, it's a terrible excuse for a movie.
61898|1|Reuniting with Andrew Gregory, Louis Malle, in what became his swan song, has made a modern, captivation version of the Chekhov play.

18333|1|Entertaining, but brainless, popcorn fun.
75121|1|So-so Sellers vehicle has its funny moments.
36991|1|As Pre, Billy Crudup is dynamite -- a magnetic star presence who's unafraid to show how Pre's drive also makes him a bit of a prick.
11371|0|Is authenticity too much to ask? It's not as if the various drug subcultures don't have enough humor and tragedy built in that you need to take a detour into Fantasyland.
7065|1|Howl's Moving Castle is a visually wondrous, invigorating work of breathless invention and grandiosity, full of hushed pastoral glens, zeppelin blitzkriegs, whimsical machines, and blobs that wear straw hats. And it's not Miyazaki's finest.

79553|1|For the simplicity and strength of its emotional core, Lan Yu is an exquisite film.
11229|0|Give My Regards to Broad Street is about as close as you can get to a nonmovie, and the parts that do try something are the worst.

68153|1|"Reliant more on powerful familial emotions than wacky splendor, ""Big Fish"" treads as close to our real world as Tim Burton ever could - a melancholy dissection of paternal distance and never truly knowing how many lives those we love can truly affect."
49599|1|Intense yet subtlely handled on every level, Dead Man Walking is one of the most remarkable and memorable films of 1995
19538|1|It's tough to beat as an outrageously phlegmy deposit in Hollywood's spittoon.
5430|1|Less a moral dilemma than a meditation on the differences between men and women in matters of social decorum.
14656|1|A fun, sometimes cheesy descent into apocalyptic nonsense.
23978|1|A refreshingly mature look at sexuality: these are people over 30 enjoying active sex lives and able to intelligently examine their actions and the consequences.

71074|1|Ninety percent of this thriller is absolutely terrific; but the 10 percent that fails is so troubling that it threatens to undermine all that is wonderful in the rest.
74758|0|A study of the urban dope-dealing culture and its toll on everyone who comes in contact with it, the picture has an insider's feel that is constantly undercut by the filmmaker's impulse to editorialize.
16907|1|[There are] no weeping martyrs or brave romantic souls. It deals with real people, complete in their human complexity, their dumb choices, their damaging outbursts, their illogical desires, and their emotional honesty.
121|1|A genuinely excellent film, horrifying and touching and beautiful in a bloody sort of way. A bit like real life, really.
24751|0|"This isn't the worst film of its kind, but it isn't the best either. ""Confidence"" is only Hollywood's most recent attempt at a cookie-cutter sting/heist film... If you want something other than junk food, go rent ""Diggstown"" again."

91|1|There's something about feature films that brings out the best in the Pythons. The occasional indulgence of the TV series is replaced by a more focused approach which wrings every conceivable joke out of a given subject.
20827|1|Best read not as an homage to Hitchcock - or to special super secret guest star Orson Welles - than as a study of what Carol Reed biographer Robert F. Moss describes as 'the ineffectuality of goodness.'

41097|1|[Rec] sets out to terrify and it succeeds nicely.
76642|1|In his third, most accomplished film, LaBute puts aside the inquiry of misogyny that dominated his previous work and immerses himself in a lighter romantic fable about the collision of fantasy and reality, with a terrific performance from Renee Zelwegger
13253|1|In the hands of a lesser talent, this might have become a self-conscious stunt, but in Hitchcock's it has the tightly wound perfection of a flawless sonnet or sonata.

47678|1|It's often been said that we don't really know people, that we don't know what goes on in other people's marriages, no matter how intimate we may be with them. With this film, Rudolph sneaks us a peak.
3660|1|Irresistible...the prime hams and real-life friends share comic timing that can only come from years of experience. [Blu-ray]
8988|0|That it is awkwardly conceived, the premise is absurd and it's just not funny, are its major flaws.
21643|1|Kudos to Michelle Pfeiffer and Treat Williams.

10276|0|Though well-acted, Troche's third film, an adaptation of short stories, is a minor addition of a fractured, ensemble narrative to the overly populated genre of suburban malaise and anomie in the wake of the success of Mendes' Oscar-winner American Beauty

8194|1|It's clear right away that The Paper benefits substantially from Keaton's typically stellar turn as the central character...

60600|0|Howard Franklin's screenplay plays less like a feature film than like the pilot for a failed television series about New York policemen.
74033|0|The most preposterous movie in theaters isn't the Ace Ventura sequel (or even Money Train) but this wanna-be nail-biter.
61772|1|a brutal and brutalizing film whose effects have diminished little in the decades since its controversial theatrical release in the late 1970s

74425|1|[That Wiene], this outsider, with no knowledge of studio customs, no reverence for studio traditions, should have turned out The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari seems a thing almost too strange for belief.
64537|1|Plays as urban farce, but thanks to first-time director Chester's light touch and affectionally observant eye and ear, it's also a genuinely affecting love story.
78733|0|Overall this movie just doesn't live up to its aims.
53718|1|Despite its flaws, Crazy as Hell marks an encouraging new direction for La Salle.
18239|0|It's a fun idea, but quite awkwardly staged and, in the end, not particularly engaging.
29680|1|It's Bullock's first shot at a role in which she plays second fiddle neither to males nor special effects. And she turns out to be every bit as delightful as anyone might have expected.
49500|1|As a nature documentary it's nothing special. But that was never the intent. As an observational study of people and place, it's truly fascinating.
8803|1|Give in to the mood piece and bathe in its glamorous nostalgic glow. It's a beauty.
63737|0|Honey is just dumb but teens love it.
60845|1|A work of straightforward emotion and pulse-quickening tension.

4078|1|Schmaltzy and soft, but still hard to resist, especially if you can't imagine your life without the movies.
9293|0|The dialogue has more pauses than a High School production of Samuel Beckett. And while that works up to a point, you find yourself wanting to grab the characters and shake them out of their introspective stupors.
8934|1|Director Michael Apted has taken what could have been a routine courtroom drama and built instead a stunning study of familial love and misunderstanding.
50361|0|Horror movie that lets its location do all the work.

14784|1|Fascinating and messy as only Fellini can be.
14072|1|Kudrow and Sorvino are fun to watch, Garafalo is deliciously acerbic, and the whole Valley Girl reunion thing is a stroke of light-and-fluffy genius.
34180|0|Carpenter can't cloak the hilarity of this hoary horror tale.
2713|1|This film is sometimes too familiar, especially in early scenes that deliberately repeat the first film's gags. But the formula isn't tired yet.
42423|1|Grossly comical!
35864|1|If Batman Begins was the classy hors d'oeuvre in Christopher Nolan's blockbuster trilogy, then this awesome follow-up is a main course that delivers on all levels.

41456|0|Your average five-year-old could have constructed a plot with fewer holes in it.
28934|0|Mifune was miscast.
8957|1|A sprightly little entertainment that should enthrall tots without straining the patience of their parents.
33625|0|Streisand is stunning, but the film is a trial, particularly when the music disappears somewhere around the 90-minute mark and all that's left is leaden melodrama.
14244|0|A fairly loud, pointless exercise in future-cop heroics, with Sylvester Stallone as a one-man cop, jury and judge who gets set up in order to .. oh, like you can't figure it out.

17596|1|The film at least manages to make some sense of an extraordinary moment in history, as Rome expanded from republic to empire.
3834|1|A fun action-packed fantasy...
41947|0|The fantasy is earthbound, the score by Richard and Robert Sherman (who also wrote music and lyrics for Mary Poppins) is forgettable, the special effects lackadaisical.
48774|1|Stembridge makes the twists as pleasantly surprising as the dawning realization that you've gone from judge to accomplice.
6564|1|Subtle, elegant, enigmatic, this movie by the veteran Oliveira exercises a powerful grip.
52444|1|Leone shows his skills with superb mastery over the medium.
55214|0|When the story sticks to character and action, it succeeds. When it strays off into philosophical and psychological rambling...it loses interest.
80235|1|It's an all too frequent occurrence to see the phrase 'instant classic' bandied about; Chopper was appropriately adorned with that title.
9268|0|For a voyeuristic medium, this tale of a voyeur does a poor job of prying into its own protagonist's life.

62361|1|"Although ""Birthday Girl"" is labeled a romantic comedy, it's not wildly funny or romantic."

75455|1|It's still as visually striking as anything you will see by this director.
64566|0|Both Ice Cube and Voigt are fun to watch in the film. The other actors are forgettable.
28166|1|Flubber provides fuel for a very funny piece of hyperbolic humor in the grand American tradition of Paul Bunyan, and Director Robert Stevenson and Scriptwriter Bill Walsh get plenty of bounce out of every ounce.
33767|1|The electricity in the air is so palpable each time Tate takes on the role of Lymon on the concert stage that we wonder how do-wop could ever have gone out of fashion.
65168|1|Emotionally shattering as a masterful purely realistic cinema experience.
66224|1|A finely tuned mood piece, a model of menacing atmosphere.
48826|1|I'd like to pin four stars on each shoulder of George C. Scott for his perspective characterization of the military genius, the controversial man.

33404|1|[Spike] Lee doesn't attempt to answer the complicated questions of racism, misunderstanding and simmering anger as much as confront them with a hard clarity.
71129|1|There's something essential about boys playing men in front of the women they love.
16174|1|Goya's Ghosts is less about the eponymous painter than it is a gripping two-part story of politics and faith during and after the Spanish Inquisition.
12797|0|It forever misses, unlike American Graffiti, the heady sexual climate of adolescence to concentrate on the circumstances of the sex act itself.

6144|1|It is an extraordinary achievement in an unforgettable film.
49392|1|The thematics are rather cloying, but the mood -- profoundly relaxed, bemused -- eventually conquers.
25429|1|Charming comedy-romance-thriller pairing Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, intelligently scripted by Peter Stone and directed in distinctly Hitchcockian style by Stanley Donen.
78579|0|The suspicion that all this froth builds up towards nothing but some poetic imagery is inexorably realized and sours the magic of the second half of the film.
15959|0|This is not a fun stupid movie. This is a stupid movie that makes me want to claw my skin off.
403|1|I tend to doubt that you will ever see this movie double billed with Citizen Kane, but the two movies are structured pretty similarly.
27056|1|Arguably Disney's greatest masterpiece, this sophisticated animation is one that continues to delight audiences of all ages
16895|0|Desperately trying to infuse new blood into the 1980s franchise, the fourth installment is a hodgepodge that fashions recycled ideas and characters; the rebllious girl is played Hilary Swank, who would go to Oscar glory.
63482|0|Campy as a flick by Banderas' evident artistic mentor, Pedro Alm√≥dovar.
31249|1|The greatest of all British films, the greatest film about Britishness
40941|1|Breathtaking in its cinematography, production design and sound work, Sorcerer is a worthy contender for the film with the most suspenseful set-pieces in Hollywood history - if such an arbitrary title existed.
19920|0|This film has little to recommend itself.
2759|1|Decent enough entertainment as written, though many will regret the movie's eleventh-hour detour into pieties.
12255|0|There's something almost perverse about a show that only comes alive as the curtain rises and falls...
13248|0|Did a dry California wind scramble the script as they moved into the third act? Did the tape recorder go on the blitz at the story conferences? Was there a fire in the editing room?
50884|1|It comes down to the charms of Keaton and Davis in the end. You like these characters and root for them to score.
26148|1|An underrated, very scary film, although William Peter Blatty is better with frightening moments and images than he is at creating a narrative that matters or makes any real good sense.
28952|0|Though a fine actor, DiCaprio is no Errol Flynn. With his choirboy face and chess-club physique, he is scarcely fit to play swashbuckling hero or villain.
24181|0|It's self-conscious nastiness, once removed from its motivating source.
17026|0|Intellectually posturing.
23528|0|Though handsome to look at (cinematography is by Owen Roizman), the movie is overlong, stately, and too detailed for its own good; director Kasdan claims his version if more accurate, which may be true, but it doesn't make for a good picture.
36245|1|Starring Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren at their prime, Anthony Mann's grand historical epic is still much admired by viewers and directors.
44571|0|Love, in all her contradictory and confrontational glory, is far more compelling than any flimsy conspiracy theory.
51634|0|The film has a spectacular variety of liabilities (and, to be fair, strengths as well), but the most visible and crushing is that's an utter dud as a star vehicle.
16994|0|What begins promisingly soon deteriorates into a tepid mish-mash of implausibility.
9641|1|Susan Sarandon, as Hattie, is seamless and flawless, not to mention at her shapliest best.
45396|1|This is Adam Sandler at his best, and his latest films are cheap grabs at what once came so easily to him.
19223|1|'God's gonna trouble the water,' goes the chorus from the African-American spiritual that gives Trouble the Water its title, but no deity is to blame for the tide of bureaucratic bungling and inhumanity the movie reveals.
17481|1|Ambitious in structure and casting, it packs a lot into its screen time. Quality craftsmanship for a discerning crowd.
35019|0|...distinctly underwhelming...
14282|1|Although the movie contains occasional moments of glimpsed accomplishment, Kansas City is for the most part a lame duck.
62429|1|Blanchett never curtsies to caricature. Her interpretation is complex, restrained, warmly sensual.
30681|1|Probably shouldn't be your first stop into the wonderfully weird world of Fellini, but his fans should absolutely find something to savour in this enjoyable little farce.
69935|1|A solid, memorable drama with two stellar performances.....overlooked and then some
10405|0|Bland '90s Power Rangers film has lots of violence, peril.
31363|1|The simplistic plot and simple story work thanks to the energy and light touch of director Nick Castle.
24964|0|Emblematic of the underside of 70s American film.
65407|1|...one of the most refreshingly mean-spirited comedies to come around in quite some time.
51100|0|Let it go, Michael. Your subjects are obviously ready to do the same.
39991|1|What's most effective about the new Kiss of Death is Tucci's marvelously slimy prosecutor.
32090|0|Parker, whose screenplay strips down the original play, merely produces a lackluster essence.
44773|1|This is undoubtedly the way Spike Lee should have done it; nothing flashy. He lets the main character's life speak for itself.
3061|0|Reign of Fire contains several scenes in which the screen is filled with immense fire-breathing dragons, but you don't feel the slightest twinge of awe or fear for the size of these creatures or their incredible destructive powers.
62396|1|You should see Happy Feet -- not only because it's stupendous, but also because it features the best dancing you'll see on the screen this year.
19564|1|...unusually enjoyable.
4817|1|It has the physique and will of a bold adventurer, but it's afflicted with acute brain-stem damage. Mixed in among some of Trekdom's best moments are some of the canon's sloppiest choices...
54295|1|Much of the movie's emotional work has to be done by...faces and eyes, while other people speak of other things, and to see that happening is frustrating, because it happens so slowly, and romantic, because it happens at all.
41648|0|The truth is that The Truth About Charlie gets increasingly tiresome.
26942|1|Undeniably a high-level achievement.
10646|1|Intermittently brilliant!
30328|0|For all those out there who can't get enough of Prince, Under the Cherry Moon may be just the antidote.
49348|1|Alias superspy Jennifer Garner makes the most of her first starring role and discovers that love -- and navigating adult life -- really is a battlefield.
41798|0|This wan attempt at inspirational comedy doesn't bother to look closely at anything.
3745|1|"Beneath its deadpan and often absurdist exterior, ""Daddy and Them"" feels like a very personal piece of work about how family really does come first, warts and all."
76671|1|Angela Bassett is a wonderfully sympathetic screen presence who may have a big career ahead of her.
19286|1|"What makes ""Evita"" so powerful is its ability to convey complex emotions through its music."
73411|1|A stirring little documentary.
10664|1|Despite the early stylistic flourishes, Alice is a mostly naturalistic venture from Scorsese, and not that indicative of what would follow in his career. But it's a fantastic combination of these two seemingly divisive styles.
58140|1|Howard delivers exactly the kind of thoroughly entertaining commercial enterprise you might expect, only this one comes chock-full of breathtaking pyrotechnics allowing the ridiculous posturing of the two leads to take a back seat.
1907|1|Amiable enough as a frothy entertainment, with darker overtones rendered with emotional effectiveness.
53948|0|Madonna may have the body, but there's no evidence she can act with it.
63853|1|Slightly smarmy romantic comedy that never quite jells.
44014|1|One of the rare few family movies that should enchant both children and grown-ups.
75850|0|The screenplay, by helmer Mangold, is by the numbers.
21667|1|A skillfully told, beautifully shot coming-of-age story.
15932|1|While his philosophical ventures seem stuck in the shallow end of the pool, Zemeckis takes an important step forward as a filmmaker.
30908|0|The Douglas clan's answer to the Fondas' On Golden Pond might easily have been called On Golden Turkey.
81693|1|There are a lot of movies from that era that do basically the same things... but not many of them do them as well.
19609|1|Andrew Horn's film charts Nomi's remarkable rise, his brief cult fame and his untimely flameout in 1983 as one of the arts community's earliest AIDS fatalities.
80881|1|Both a joyous comedy and a tense thriller. Indeed, its climactic car-chase sequence is easily as dramatic as any of those found in today's summer blockbusters.
45786|1|Diane Lane is sexy as hell in this somewhat misguided tale of marital infidelity.
23072|1|Central Station is both literate and emotionally-powerful -- an increasingly rare combination.
62805|1|Continues to set the standards for sequels to this day...
67869|0|It's difficult to make a film about depressive types that isn't depressing.
38882|0|"This does pretty much what it says on the tin, though the interactive ""3D"" element does introduce a twist of sorts."
7562|0|The screenplay, by Steven Katz, suffers from arch, almost unspeakably theatrical dialogue, and, as Murnau, John Malkovich recites his lines as if monomania were synonymous with monotonic: He drains the drama of blood.
71699|1|One of Brando's great acting performances.
51571|1|One of those welcome visitors, a movie that turns out to be much more than we expected.
49150|1|Sergei Eisenstein's mannerist epic about the Russian hero who warded off the invading Teutonic knights is a near-perfect combination of image and sound.
17533|1|An erratically amusing throwback to the science-fiction paranoia films of the 1950s.
52612|1|A very complex and engrossing mystery, filled with wonderful period details.
2335|1|Not even Bu√±uel with a brainful of Woodstock's bad brown acid could have made something this gloriously screwy.
493|1|[The film] examines how this unstable social climate strains the incipient friendship between two boys.
28173|0|We are not impressed.
24879|1|Meddles uneasily between comedy and action-adventure, but Chevy Chase and Dan Ayrkoyd keep you watching right way through
52325|0|Despite the mostly convincing verisimilitude of the approach, the film does succumb, especially in its last act, to some cheap manipulation, one or two bad stereotypes, and some cornball Hollywood schmaltz.
65689|0|The movie's two instincts are at complete odds with each other.
70044|1|Stays within the universe of its characters, and inhabits it totally. And within that universe, men and woman fail to find sexual and personal happiness because they can't break through their patterns of treating each other as objects.
55826|1|Here the machinery of divine intervention is taken for a freaky secular spin via the familiar cinematic modes of urban realism and even science fiction, and a detective mystery becomes a mystery rite.
46936|0|Less than halfway though I was checking my watch in boredom and wondering how if there was much more to go.
35207|1|A moving morality play indicting America for its ongoing love affair with the Second Amendment.
53679|1|A rare comedy that never quite wears out its welcome.
74656|0|...an ambitious misfire.
70620|1|It's a beguiling, eccentric blend of romantic drama and political thriller, and at its centre is a charismatic performance from Stephen Rea.
15055|0|Psycho is not a long film but it feels long. Perhaps because the director dawdles over technical effects; perhaps because it is difficult, if not impossible, to care about any of the characters.
7074|0|The arthouse Pleasantville, this handsomely crafted facsimile of '50s melodrama is unengaging and redundant, the lacquered artifice erecting a barrier between screen and audience.
4786|1|Even if you've never watched an episode of Hogan's Heroes, Auto Focus is worth a spin in your DVD player.
67263|1|The degree to which this film is unsettling is testimony to the strength of the acting and direction.
74197|1|In delivering their message, the Farrelly Brothers seem to have compromised their nothing-is-sacred comedy spirit, but at least their hearts are in the right place.
76667|0|The would-be surprise only makes you rethink the reason you went to see the movie in the first place.
48946|1|Still Coppola's best film since Apocalypse Now. It has an enthusiasm that much of his post-1970's work has lacked.
2771|1|A spectacular adventure story with a smidgin of romance, King Solomon's Mines is exciting enough and adventurous enough and wholesome enough for the whole family.
1221|1|As brisk as it is rich, The Last Samurai is much more fun than a mere history lesson.

47801|0|For fans of the 'old' Steve Martin, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is an interesting case study in how an actor can evolve in ability, but devolve in likeability, over time.
2736|1|It's got flavor, but it's not especially fresh.
37704|1|As troublesome as Wells' philosophy may be, especially his faith in technocracy, Things certainly helped urge the medium into a new era - another Nation's Birth of artistry, and ignorance.
81432|0|An ultimately overwrought project!
9460|1|An unusually crisp and boldly shot Texas Chainsaw Massacre knockoff.
60468|0|We could have done just as well to watch the proceedings on Court TV -- free, as it were, to flip channels or get up for a snack and skip the parts that disinterest us, rather than be held hostage by 125 minutes of drive-by clich√©s.
62150|1|Moskowitz may soon find himself in the same boat as many of the artists he is analyzing, because Stone Reader is going to be one tough act to follow.
34835|1|Not only are the characters in The Last Days of Disco embarrassingly earnest about their love for spectacular nightclubs and thumping dance music, but they're also completely transparent about their desires, even when they think they're being clever.
43195|0|It's rather like the favorite pastime of this movie's villain ... throwing wild dogs into a pit and watching them fight until there's only one left standing.
24659|0|This is a dumb, pointless, boring romance from beginning to end.
16365|1|it is likely that this documentary will surprise, disturb, and even anger you with the evidence presented ... deserves praise for opening eyes

34288|0|What might have played out as a passable whodunit becomes instead a frustrating drag.
29436|1|John C. Reilly does Dewey Cox as a hilarious stoner, beer gut middle-aged teen, with a touch of Imus. Move over, Britney Spears.
7499|1|A frazzled, dangerous and dark comedy-drama.
31999|0|The film was a typical seventies sci-fi effort, scientifically illiterate and unimaginatively composed.

48738|0|An expose of the Catholic hierarchy in a state of mind-boggling paralysis, presented in a fictional context that, inevitably, dulls its edge and makes us question its accuracy.
2836|1|Surprisingly enjoyable.
11428|0|"The ""wow"" kind of bad that people still talk about 20 years after the fact. Rent it and see."
10362|1|Possibly the Cohen joint that brims with the most all-pervasive invention and danger
22265|0|Fatiguingly mundane snoozer.
56456|1|The script spends at least as much time exploring the psychologies of the young players and the problems they face at home as it does rallying the audience behind their efforts on the field.

59505|0|much of the film is padded out by the comic business of Mike Myers' cat, in a deeply flawed role falling somewhere between a stand-up dying on stage or an alcoholic clown harassing kids at a birthday party.
18735|1|You can watch Bullets Over Broadway with the sound off and have a thrilling time. You can listen to it from the next room and achieve total bliss.
17384|1|A biting farce about an American in Italy, this gets great comic mileage out of Lemmon, Mills and the Mediterranean, but Wilder seems uncertain whether he's laughing with or at his protagonists.
70127|1|The film ultimately becomes too contrived to be anything but a fleeting diversion, but kudos to these emerging filmmakers for daring to make something a little bit different and, for the most part, intriguing.
16164|1|It's concerned with the differences between the culture we profess and the lifestyles we actually indulge. Even more, it's about the consequences of betrayal.
75297|1|An amiable comedy.

20274|1|One of the funniest, if slightest, Westerns of recent years.
79666|1|Pure '70s Hollywood.

61423|1|Director David Jacobson gives Dahmer a consideration that the murderer never game his victims.
60632|1|Both an unalloyed delight and a surprisingly human, moving film.
74323|1|It's swifter, grittier, and louder than the typical escape movie, but it still falls firmly within the tradition of underground breakouts. Its contrapuntal timelines are twisted into a surprisingly elegant first feature.

9289|0|A diligent ensemble can't lift the film to anything higher than a shallow fairy tale with only worthy intentions.
80075|1|Something to offend everyone.

39820|1|Some of the blues performances here are rousingly hot and could make believers out of the staunchest classical music snob.
20090|1|National Velvet is not merely sure to delight children and the child in most adults; it is also an interesting psychological study of hysterical obsession, conversion mania, preadolescent sexuality.

18600|1|Energetic, original and icky, Raimi's splat-stick debut is a tight little horror classic that deserves its cult reputation, despite the best efforts of the censors.
20414|1|There's a constant tension in the air, as if the characters could make catastrophic decisions at any moment but the film consistently surprises you by upturning the expected cliches.
30756|1|The writing is intelligent, the pratfalls mostly work, and everyone is having a good time.
33408|1|Its major sin -- a certain ineluctable improbability -- is pretty much offset by the moments of winsome humanity Gibson finds for his freebooter; by the rich, nicely tuned portrayals of the other actors; and by director Ron Howard.

48026|1|Garofalo's good in this, but I didn't buy the romance.
18514|1|While its consonance comes largely from Gordon Willis's photography and Allen's spacious sense of New York, pathos comes at best from Keaton's evaporative performance and a slightly sentimental conception.

55177|0|The tepidly anticipated return of the videogame vixen belly-flopped on its US release, and it did so with a splat that could drown out several summer blockbusters' worth of car-crunch and detonations.
33257|1|Schwentke's solid cast and a visual talent for nailing the unsavory, noir-soaked milieu compensate for some of the more gratuitous eccentricities.

53529|1|One of the last great musicals to be written especially for the screen.
374|0|Hawks delivers his usual heavy-handed direction, but the film's premise is too flimsy to spread over two hours. The script is marred by tired comic routines and slow pacing.
72951|1|Inspired by Godard's lyrical film-essays, Linklater revisits his unreleased debut (also set on a train), while paying tribute to Rohmer's cerebral moral fables. Though narrower in scope, this film is more mature and generous than previous efforts.

7034|1|Jaime and Lupe are vividly realized, sympathetic characters.
42943|1|One of the great masterpieces of world cinema: austere, warm, grim, surreal, shocking and heartbreaking.
60080|1|More of a young turk provocation than a measured and mature intercession on rage and despair, but it certainly achieves the unsettling effect Noe intended.
70338|0|This potentially stylish cyberpunk movie is turned into nothing more than an endless series of tiresome chase sequences.
8002|1|Perhaps the defining Chaplin film, and certainly his funniest.

3360|0|It's not that this is a bad film, after all it does have fine actors and it is based on a great story. It just doesn't live up to its predecessors.
51422|0|Despite a broad range of effective comedy and a decent laugh-per-minute ratio, Mallrats is likely to be a moderate disappointment for anyone who guffawed their way through the previous film.
6241|1|Traitor is undeniably an intelligent, watchable thriller that wisely steers clear of racial stereotyping, yet manages to fall short of delivering a wholly satisfying cerebral or visceral experience.

2456|1|The usual fever of adjectives -- terrific, titanic, transcendent -- sounds puny.

57112|1|A vastly underappreciated sequel with a fine lead performance by Roy Scheider. Director Peter Hyams took a huge gamble, and succeeds beautifully.
19853|1|Alfonso Cuaron stages some terrific set-pieces, and the production designers deserve credit for making London in 2027 look like the grunge capital of the world, ie, like now, only more so. One small problem: I didn't believe any of it.

64933|1|Puccini is the joyously refreshing romancer that it tries so hard to be. Its success has a lot to do with its casting directors who have peopled both the major and minor roles with aplomb. Even off-off-Broadway legend Helen Hanft has a cameo.

15867|1|It's the best thing Mr. Jarmusch has done to date.
64916|0|...an art-house experiment gone horribly wrong.
54842|0|The script lacks focus and consistency of approach, and the whole becomes a mixture of emotional manipulation and laughable caricature.
16388|1|...Better than its dreadful theatrical campaign suggested [but] as prosaically made as the others in Penny Marshall's post-Big canon.
36537|1|Robert Zimmerman achieved his dream of becoming a singer, but in doing so he surrendered the ability to define himself on his own terms.
66272|1|Ironically, there's now something almost comforting about the way the film sticks to formula, but the action is still authentically thrilling.
1921|1|Finally, a baseball melodrama with a full count of emotional impact. Hancock's narrative delivers the right pitch of intensity
19145|1|Best known for launching the underexposed Grant's career. And for being severely overrated.
54787|0|Face it: If you've seen one deviated septum gag, you've seen them all.
8722|0|Even worse than the original ... which was pretty dire to begin with.
30739|0|Well, if nothing else, they got the name right. This is an immensely stupid movie.
5948|1|A potent comic-book-style action-adventure.
45313|1|Gleefully over the top - Ken Russell's last good movie.
59054|0|While The Women provides an evening of laughter and some points to ponder, relationships work only when all involved are willing to sacrifice for one another.
30765|1|Delivers laughs, and lots of them.
28055|1|And the Oscar goes to.....
7236|1|Offering fine, if not the most eye-pleasing, production values and convincing acting, East-West and its important theme deserve attention.
22697|1|In this intimate chamber piece for two gay men, based on minimal dialogue but rich visual imagery, Newby depicts through glances and gestures how a distrusting relationship evolves into a passionate and erotic love.
7493|0|Ultimately what we have here is further evidence of just how difficult it is to make a film that works.
74860|1|A remarkably clean, bracing production that does a difficult thing exceptionally well, depicting believably modern young people in a believably old-fashioned plot.
17882|0|A raucous parody of bodies-through-the-plate-glass-window action flicks, the movie has been made in a slavish but pedestrian imitation of the Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker house style.
26907|0|Drew Barrymore stars in a melodrama that borders on high-class kiddie porn.
75127|0|The film seems uncomfortable in either the silent or sound camp.
64828|0|Amounts to overkill and leaves no room for interpretation or analysis.
54986|0|"The ""me"" generation discarded sexual norms when it suited them, and Cronenberg offers a variety of punishments for their hypocrisy."
3353|1|Not the high point of the Mailer career, but it's a small, entertaining part of it.
29940|1|A pleasant, straight-down-the-road, clich√©-ridden ride.
694|0|Lost in Space isn't so much a movie version of an old TV show as a mind-blowing, multi-media video game that threatens to blast audiences into submission with bleeps and blips, fiery explosions, clever gizmos and ear-splitting sound effects.
46713|0|A largely frustrating 90-minute experience.
4303|1|You feel like you're watching a real family traipse through an uncertain world instead of actors creating relationships on the spot.
6497|0|An iconic film character deserved a better story than this.
47943|0|Feels every bit as oppressive and joyless as the rather odd choice of homes in which many of the film's characters live.
16917|0|De Palma's lamentable decision to reign in his wild directorial flourishes certainly doesn't do the film any favors...
72588|0|...the story offers so many lapses in logic, so many plot holes and so much dialogue to howl for that there's plenty to talk about afterward.
6988|0|The result is a very believable strip club, inhabited by cardboard-thin protagonists who come across as caricatures more than actual people.
4044|1|A graphic and extremely disturbing exploration of lust and love that deserves its reputation as a classic of world cinema.
12068|1|Buster Keaton's artistic breakthrough remains to this day absolutely the funniest film ever made.
62843|1|Albert is one of the ugliest characters ever brought to the screen. Ignorant, over-bearing and violent, it's a gloriously rich performance by Gambon.
9043|0|No chemistry, no cool, no compelling characters, no air of urgency. Just a very average crime caper which fails to entertain the viewer on a gut, cerebral or superficial level. Not exactly your father's Miami Vice.
81133|0|...there's little doubt that Looker would've worked a whole lot better as a novel...
17720|1|Child performances are allways a deal breaker, but Noyce coaxes great range and rage from his child stars. As they trek across the vast land, the camera never gets in the way of focussing its energies on the protagnonists.
9307|1|One of the best series in the genre.
47002|0|The most shameless psychological quackery to come out of Hollywood since Mumford.
44613|1|A hilarious, off-beat slice of 80s cheese.
53309|1|Second-rate Arnold, but entertainingly over-the-top.
37224|0|I've seen They twice now, once theatrically and once via DVD, and...for the life of me...I can't tell you what it's about.
2441|0|The film itself is like the cinematic equivalent of a clothesline, with a steady stream of skits and gags hung out to dry.
11577|1|The fire sequences are stunning, and the build-up to them, complete with blaring sirens and bellowed conversations, has an aggressive immediacy.
64507|1|Rescue Dawn wouldn't be half the film it is if it were not for the stellar performances by Bale and Zahn.
66049|0|As they say in football, pass.
78713|1|Director James Foley and screenwriter Nicholas Kazan expertly recreate that part of America that feels like it should exist under a rock with the clammy mud and scurrying insects, and their efforts are supported by an intense performance from Walken.
36424|0|Ready-made for 3am HBO viewing, The Lodger is an unnecessary remake of a story that's already been covered more than enough times, thanks.
58329|0|We'll allow this sad little premature ejaculation of a movie to choke on its own insufficiencies.
22913|1|Quick-paced editing; good special effects.
61876|1|A poignant and compelling story about relationships, Food of Love takes us on a bumpy but satisfying journey of the heart.
56589|1|you don't mind the lack of structure, especially since it's delivered by a good-natured and good-humored young cast
80239|1|Being suppressed by those who wanted [I Am Cuba] made in the first place is a vindication of sorts. Mere propaganda only reinforces the status quo. True art is revolutionary.
81444|1|As an actor, Ben Affleck might be a supporting player trapped in a leading man's body, but as a filmmaker he's an auspicious talent.
53351|0|This slight and pleasantly predictable film coasts along on the considerable charms of its cast and exotic setting.
20405|1|The Birdcage grossed nearly $200 million worldwide in 1996, and that is significant. Box Office Mojo says it's the highest grossing queer film of all time, though they're not counting Frozen and 300, and they probably should.
56451|1|The combination of optimism, tragedy, and the fuzzy warmth of new love is absolutely flawless.
10328|1|Anything but your regular 'toon, it's a (literally) fantastic experience.
6494|1|Pillow Talk is a sleekly sophisticated production that deals chiefly with s-e-x.
13843|0|This is just embarrassing, a simply and utterly embarrassing attempt to market money from a charming film.
39611|0|A sub-par film that showed the potential for the Brothers Ice to be much better actors than they are musical performers. They make the film almost worth watching. Yes, I said almost.
33802|1|The bravura blend of English eccentricity thanks to Ricky Gervais' presence and the surreal fantasy of a new take on the 'I see dead people' concept makes for highly entertaining cinema, especially in the first half
76041|1|Better than it looks!
33439|1|Cookie's Fortune is a wittily diagrammed portrait of a small town shaken to its roots by this deceptive calamity. The movie, though, never really becomes more than a diagram.
40182|0|The movie shows that the only thing worse than a generically screwy thriller is one with a selective narrator -- and one that doesn't give viewers a fair chance to play along.
51199|0|Tosh, but disarmingly sincere.
65845|0|Basically Romero Lite, but a strong cast and capable direction by Ernest Dickerson provide it with some lift.
16688|1|"Wexler may have been going after something ""cool,"" but what he came up with is smoking hot cinema that puts Jean-Luc Goddard to shame."
41210|1|Minghella, once again, shows his eclectic talents.
4019|0|The worst is saved for last: just when you think the movie has shown the courage of its 'gritty' convictions, it hits you with schmaltz that would shame a Hallmark card.
18309|1|Good fun, with a timeless generational understanding theme tossed in for good measure.
8497|1|The characters here aren't just bad; most of them are truly vile -- human slime. And the film makers chew them up (especially two nefarious bonbons played by Danny DeVito and Bette Midler) with the toothsome glee of jolly cannibals.
78049|1|With its earthy Sven Nykvist cinematography and its emphasis on the character's rumpled clothes and weathered homes, this Postman is like something from the [Bob] Rafelson of 10 years earlier: pensive and realistic.
12044|0|I had hoped Generations would rescue Star Trek from its pervasive dullness, but somehow things have gotten even more boring
22214|1|Deserves a wide audience hungry for sympathetic, three-dimensional people caught up in something bigger than themselves.
73739|1|It's funny, it's sad and, frankly, it's a bit weird.
39176|1|This is a tale of difficult choices and wistful decisions, of trying to choose between two types of love when only one is possible. It is touching without being sappy, and beautifully photographed.
21277|1|The makers of Big Fat Liar understand kids. That alone earns it a place in the list of genuinely funny comedies for kids.
12272|1|The movie is fast and warmly generous towards just about everyone on the screen.
50744|0|A list of players doesn't quite indicate the pile-on of firepower that will converge for the final showdown, or the convolutions of plot that draw everyone to the same location.
60939|1|Hands-down, the most stirring and pertinent documentary of 2001.
23325|1|"Redford is to be commended for making a film that dares to navigate the ""theater of ideas,"" despite its flaws."
30389|0|Vitus freaks you out, but its makers seem to have no idea that it does.
68071|0|With all the sympathy, empathy and pity fogging up the screen...His Secret Life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles.
15734|1|...deserves better than its early exit from theaters. How can you possibly dismiss the irrepressible Robin Tunney?
62750|1|One exceedingly well-crafted piece of manipulation that keeps the audience strung along with every intricate turn of the plot.
4648|0|A slushy, sentimental, and silly love story.
3941|1|Great boy-and-dog tale, but be prepared for tears.
45295|1|Suggests that there is no family wound that cannot be healed by love and forgiveness.
76406|1|It may not be first-rank Hitchcock, but even second-tier Hitchcock is better than what most other directors produce.
14376|1|Perhaps the most accomplished and difficult of Luis Bu√±uel's Mexican films.
63355|0|One From the Heart is aptly named. No one will mistake it for One From the Brain.
17135|0|Aldrich was a man's man director; he could direct black comedy, but he had no idea how to handle the straightforward, earnest brand on display here.
79369|1|If you think the latest crop of skinny white girls (Diaz, Alba, Garner, Gellar, et al.) knows how to kick ass, then you need to educate yourself with a little jolt of Coffy.
70113|1|Unveils the different shades of love and the ways we can unsettle our lives through impulsive sex.
55587|1|This is a terrifically chilling entertainment, one that deserves a spot alongside the best paranoid thrillers of the 1970s.
51699|0|...basically entertaining - particularly if approached on the same level one approaches a sitcom.
65220|1|Just as teenagers enjoy escapist movies, so do the elderly. They simply prefer a gentler pace. What is touching about Mrs. Palfrey is that she is allowed to be elderly, and not turned into a hip-hop granny.
10471|1|Writer Paddy Chayevsky's prescient 1976 satire of lies, injustice and the American way...has lost none of its sting. [Blu-ray]
20003|1|"This psychological thriller is penned by Ira Levin, of ""Rosemary's Baby"" fame..."
19862|1|Ultimately a rewarding -- if weird -- experience. It's just too bad that it takes so long to get there.
63431|0|Low-energy and grindingly mediocre, it adds a whole new dimension to Harlin's wildly uneven oeuvre: tedium.
8764|1|What [the characters] need most from their maker is something he couldn't have given them at the time: the 1960s.
7181|1|It's a masterful and unsentimental child's-eye view of the cold, hard adult world.
68663|1|full review in Greek
17457|0|a frothy confection that, much like its characters, often seems at odds with its own ambitions.
47490|1|Anyone for goose pimples? If so, there is a plethora of such epidermal elevations in this entry in to the apparently endless cycle of horror plays with which the world's screens are currently being flooded.
3428|0|There's something tired and rotten about this Fugitive send-up right from the start.
19641|1|A tour-de-force thriller from Hyams and Douglas... its final moments are as gripping as Superglue!
18623|1|Simple, poignant and leavened with humor, it's a film that affirms the nourishing aspects of love and companionship.
37445|1|Despite a few phony moments, the dialogue is sharp and the directing is immediate.
45743|1|Usher's amiable spoof of superhero movies takes a brave stab at rewriting the mythology from the inside out, with lots of witty, mildly subversive stuff.
48865|0|Nothing new.
9528|1|Classic non-combat WWII drama has complex themes.
19685|0|...typical of John Wayne's war films: heroic, nationalistic, patriotic, sentimental, and hokey.
29115|1|Here is the starting-point of so much modern cinema.
6619|1|Ron Perlman--the Lon Chaney of our time--plays Hellboy with grit, humor, and a depth of feeling which, barely, grounds the movie.
7255|1|definitive documentary about the porn industry
32136|0|It wants to be Boyz in the Hood (Boyz in the Wood) but the obscenity laced dialogue and raw objectification of woman renders it a contrite pretender more along the lines of Booty Call and Trippin.
45480|0|Ishtar is a failure on practically every level from its misguided narrative to its lack of humor to the absence of anything remotely entertaining.
5820|1|O'Sullivan expertly stitches together these two testimonies, linked yet separated by their differing experiences of the Palestinian cause.
10572|1|...just hilarious enough to restore trust in the star's bankability.
74107|0|It truly wouldn't take much - a minor re-edit, a few arch looks to camera, a wiseacre sidekick named 'Shortballs' - to inch this utterly mystifying throwback into spoof territory.
33673|1|Like so many things made in Japan, Sofia Coppola's new film is smaller and less costly than its standard American counterpart while at the same time superior in most important respects.
56979|1|[A] handsome, deeply felt, even more deeply reverent animated musical.
49325|0|"structured like ""Citizen Kane"" but never gets into the heart and mind of its protagonist"
805|0|It's a charmless exercise: director Richard Donner turns the kids into shrieking ferrets, and his jumpy cutting seems to lag behind the action deliberately in a curious attempt to make the film seem more chaotic and cluttered.
9535|1|This late CinemaScope western by the great Anthony Mann achieves a tragic intensity and a monumental scenic splendor despite some serious handicaps.
28049|0|Picturesque European locations, a mystery whose successive folds will be uncovered by Faith's ex-boyfriend (Christopher Eccleston, in a ratty wig he will have to live down for years), and some heavily psychological sermonizing.
69523|1|Spoofy send up of Western films is OK for mature tweens.
78736|0|Nielsen's schtick is getting pretty threadbare by now -- his movies used to wring laughs from assaults on his silver-haired dignity, but after years of screen buffoonery, he has no dignity left to assault.
36718|1|Starts out with a bang, ends with a whimper.
42449|1|Compelling and quirkily intelligent; Genet, one feels, would have been impressed.
52022|1|The cast are perfect, the always watchable Mastroianni excelling in a tailor-made role.
1917|1|Gripping, powerful, heart-breaking.
2228|1|A made-for-kids movie with just enough weird stuff in it to appeal to teens.
43927|0|A mildly engaging but thoroughly forgettable piece of work.
6522|1|To watch Jackie Chan, Hong Kong's king of kung fu comedy, in the fresh and exhilarating Super Cop is like watching Douglas Fairbanks Sr. or one of the silent era clowns in one of their biggest hits.
59339|1|Romper Stomper is a convincing depiction of subculture, and one that dares to present these figures as real, troubled individuals rather than stereotypes.
6914|1|only those who are intensely religious will be offended; the rest of us can just smile at the film's simple and entertaining absurdity
56328|1|Belizaire has personality and quiet charm and a lot of affection, mixed in with the more predictable action elements.
18114|1|The pinnacle of recent B-monster movies. It's what Eight Legged Freaks wants to grow up to be.
55337|0|"This isn't a movie with any meaningful insights to share about the heartfelt concerns of the over-forty set, but is rather an ill-conceived, ""coming-of-age"" style misadventure which could just as easily have revolved around some recent high school grads."
18580|0|Gere and Ryder look great, but with sparkless chemistry, and Gere spending his screen time making sad excuses for his misguided heart, this one's colder than, well, a winter in New York.
53025|1|The film works, thanks to Noyce's skill in creating suspense and staging elaborate action scenes.
71890|1|The results are certainly flawed, but rarely less than fascinating.
30598|0|"""From the beginning, the making of this movie was a blueprint for disaster. It's a feeble, badly edited, slapstick sex comedy."""
5407|1|What we want from Spielberg and Lucas is plenty of action, and plenty of laughs. And that's just what they deliver.
25712|0|It turns out to be just another inane druggie thriller with a revenge plot.
9828|1|An intense and inspired musical adaptation of Charles Dickens' classic story about an orphan's amazing ordeal on the streets of the big city.
59463|1|The filmmaker keeps the thorny issues under control
9230|1|A surprisingly solid celebration of teen angst and rebellion. Soundtrack was quite choice, as well.
78247|1|Wong has a reputation for slow-moving mood pieces in which very little happens, but that's not the case here.
45477|0|It's too bad that Gracie's story seems bent on staying on the surface of such familiar turf, rather than digging deeper to reveal what propels her.
23312|1|It's fairly ridiculous (the apes are clearly people in suits), but it's light and brisk and fun, with a nice open-air feel.
8320|1|Isn't note perfect by any stretch, but it's great fun to listen to.
65626|1|I actually know quite a few of the people in this. Creepy.
32773|1|In National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, Chevy Chase's family Christmas tree is a little full with a lot of sap, much like this movie. But it's a big-hearted fullness and it's a smoothly stirred sap.
49269|1|As the movie goes on, you actually end up rooting for this schmuck to take charge of his life, and in a way, the movie is sort of inspiring.
50923|0|Hollywood kids the Democrats because the love the Democrats.
65742|1|Certainly original, often funny, and occasionally even inspired.
24452|1|I thought this was an incredible cast and I thought they were all fantastic at bringing their characters to life.
6629|1|At its best, the film layers Lucia's and Maximilian's flashbacks in such a way that that the lines between memory, fantasy, and nightmare get blurred.
38016|0|It has really impressive and diverse cast and the story itself -- fictional or not -- can attract the viewer's attention. But Levinson wastes all that opportunity with some unfortunate directing choices.
2686|1|Balancing its frequently absurd humour with poignant observations of that time in life when you're not sure exactly what it is you're rebelling against, Igby Goes Down is an offbeat winner.
29283|1|The animation may not be in the same class as The Lion King, but co-directors Jeff McGrath and Cathy Malkasian deserve praise for their attempts to render Africa's wildlife as authentically as possible.
15056|0|Suffers from a terrible script with grossly under-developed sub-plots and characters...
52671|1|What Spike Jonze is doing is trying something completely new, messing with the idea of what exactly a movie is, what a narrator is, what a filmmaker is, really, and doing it with a beloved franchise and a $80 million budget.
58769|1|Hilarious Clouseau better in sequel than original.
8165|1|When Bob Rafelson decides to get nasty, he really means it.
11285|0|A rambling road movie with noble intentions and an excess of speechifying.
9564|0|...a frustrating and maddeningly confounding piece of work...
20123|1|Easily one of the best teen sex comedies of all time and quite possibly the best frat comedy ever made.
52699|1|It's not hard to understand why the film was such a worldwide sensation...
45956|0|Director Stewart Raffill's film is otherwise an unashamed rip-off of Spielberg's classic.
6678|0|"Barely a notch above ""The Howling"" movie series"
26813|0|The movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating.
72005|1|Herzog tears down as much as he revives in this beguiling incantation of silent cinema
40998|1|With political paternalism rampant at both extremes of the spectrum, Lucas is onto something. In any case, we'll know for sure in about a generation.
841|1|Delicately handled and handsomely made.
74361|0|The movie's sentimental vision rests on the flimsy idea that 'real' religion never sanctions cruelty.
53372|1|The film is pleasantly sweet and occasionally sharp.
8197|0|Not very interesting, imaginative, or exciting.
47288|1|While this could be the stuff of tabloid fodder at the one extreme or family fare uplift at the other, it is actually an observational meditation on childhood lost with universal applications.
5487|1|Carax does not want to tell you a story. He wants to express, in the purest way he can, his infatuation with storytelling through images and genre conventions, performance and voyeurism, cinema and cinephilia.
75694|1|Visually fascinating Western has lots of plot, and an attack on racism in the Old West.
3269|0|Yet another goofy credit in Gere's already overloaded resume of embarrassment -- although some may consider this one of those movies that's so silly it's good.
69404|1|... it is good and caring work, with more human detail than we expect.
51138|1|This consummate prison-break epic features Steve McQueen's greatest transformation of character creation over the course of his estimable film career.
38246|1|With its great turns by Donat, Carroll (the original Hitchcock blonde) and all the cast, and immaculate direction of a cracking script, this is timelessly enjoyable. A true classic.
10820|0|Though written and directed by a Pulitzer Prize winner, Original Sin is better known as the picture in which a naked Angelina Jolie (by then a certified Oscar winner) and Antonio Banderas do the horizontal mambo. [Blu-ray]
24608|0|The problem with this much disgust is that it has a leveling effect; after a while, you don't feel shocked or moved, or even dirty, just bored.
10575|1|A film with two opposite interpretations to its title -- figuratively sad, literally joyful.
19472|1|No true Peckinpah-lover should pass it by.
31237|1|A noirish thriller with experimental trimmings that holds back most of the emotions, sensitive as well as otherwise, that threatened to make Kubrick's first feature mawkish.
75686|1|A terrific ensemble, breath of fresh air for Branagh
73236|0|A ham-fisted, fitfully amusing lark that quickly runs aground.
2470|0|Full of bluster and gimmickry. Does anyone involved even remember the original movie?
64164|1|The look and feel of this historic battle is perfect for the virtual backgrounds and obscene violence. Again, trust me on the violence.
14095|1|Happy Accidents looks drab and doesn't take very good advantage of its New York locations, but the neurotic intensity and emotional honesty of its two leads more than make up for it.
12535|1|What can you do with a movie like this? Surrender, I guess.
70804|0|This bizarre and often distasteful movie at the end of the 1950s was an omen of things to come.
6966|1|Grabs for the gut by stoking primal understandings about our loving but tragically distant relationship with the wild.
39189|0|The film can't seem to make up its mind whether it wants to be a comedy, a fantasy or an adventure film.
72040|0|the romance is not interesting; the catfights at least have some potential
63087|0|Camp classic grindhouse gore.
53971|1|The ambition is bracing, but critical hindsight obscures how exciting Malle's noir thriller is on its own terms.
10688|1|Magical, captivating entertainment.
16901|1|Well-realized feminist parable about a daring and creative young woman's survival in the Old West.
33204|1|"""Mississippi Burning"" surveys the geography of racism, sheds light on the dark night of the soul."
31220|1|Witty, winsome fairy tale for the whole family.
55641|1|Chow's film is a charming, funny illustration of family life that explores the notion of being given a second chance. A kids' comedy with a heart.
17762|1|Ace is not the typical movie goofball, smart aleck, or idiot savant; he's a genuine weirdo who happens to be stunningly competent at his job. The same can be said for the film's justly popular leading man.
50984|1|Agree or disagree, this is a work so bold and provocative and distinctive that it demands to be seen.
12721|1|It may look bleak, but there's still some beauty.
4291|1|Leigh's best work yet is indisputably screen art, but it's a flesh-and-blood 'people' movie, too.
20442|1|An inspiring drama which, despite its uneven nature, still manages to pack a punch.
44568|0|Star power is not enough to save this film from mediocrity.
4808|1|Based on a true story, its style is simple, direct, forceful -- even after more than six decades.
51954|1|"If there were still drive-in cinemas around, ""Slither"" would be a perfect B horror movie to sit in your car and watch to the sound of shrieks and one-liner jokes blasting around a hilly parking lot from so many tiny speakers."
6299|1|Whether you know everything or nothing about Metallica, it will rock you.
8847|1|Straightforward wish fulfillment -- imagine what crimes against humanity we could punish if we had real, indestructible Rambos.
46897|1|It's fun for a while, but the script doesn't have the structure to sustain 85 minutes.
56374|1|It may seem that Invincible takes too long to get to the football. But by the time it does get down to it, we've invested enough in Wahlberg and Kinnear to give a damn about the outcome of the all-important Big Game.

55157|1|This is a penetrating, deeply disturbing examination of desire and loneliness, of desperation and self-denial.
63221|1|Rebecca Romijn's sexy performance will no doubt mercifully distract some viewers from the silly story, overblown melodrama, and general cheesiness.
13819|1|It's highly enjoyable and well acted, with the Iago figure better motivated than in the original play, no single line of which has been retained except for the odd echo.

25515|1|A dark, astounding film from Peter Jackson, showing his mastery of blending fact and fantasy. A deserved winner of Venice Festival's Silver Lion and Toronto Fest's Critics Award. Along with Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, this is 1994's most audacious film.

59042|1|The film leaves me with a sad, empty feeling inside so I guess Robert Bresson did his job.

24360|1|The shower sequence, the shrieking score, Anthony Perkins, that twist ending... Psycho remains a stone-cold classic.
16043|1|Unlike 'World Trade Center,' this harrowing chronicle has scarcely a hint of Hollywood. ...'United 93'... thrusts itself into the heart of the action, whether you're ready to go there or not.

72709|1|Even when he's not at his most critically insightful, Godard can still be smarter than any 50 other filmmakers still at work.
61677|1|Ultimately, not only does this epic enlighten but one hopes it may help to rekindle some of the revolutionary spirit that seems to be sadly lacking in contemporary society.
68248|0|The problem is that we get no real sense of what these characters were like before everything went haywire, so little is believably at stake.

71200|0|Keaton does a dandy job by his four Dougs, but the problem is a script that assumes a physical comedian can do it all, including twisting characters to make them fit the plot line. It doesn't work.

78034|0|De Niro is probably the most intense and idiosyncratic actor of his generation; Midnight Run may be the most conventional movie I've ever seen.
48628|0|Like Moore, whose documentary-cum-polemical style they are clearly imitating, the makers of Expelled give their critics too much ammunition, so even if you're sympathetic to some of the ideas and the underlying argument, it is still difficult to defend.
54988|1|Hackman is wonderful as an inarticulate man tense with the struggle to curb a flaring, mysterious anger.
1931|1|Unnecessary sequel is nonetheless entertaining; Roddy Mcdowall back in simian shape.

24783|1|A worthy addition to the Vietnam War film genre.
46248|1|For once, the character flaws are genuine human foibles instead of a screenwriter's idea of easily solved psychoses. These twitchy characters are pleasingly three-dimensional.
35211|1|Although some of its plotting feels forced ... The Mystic Masseur coasts along nicely on Merchant's sharply honed craftsmanship, which grants the stunning Trinidad locations an extra degree of lushness.
49822|1|Like Donnie Darko and Rushmore, Noi marks the arrival of a young filmmaker whose career is full of promise.

4170|0|Boils down to another average adaptation of one of the increasingly weak Stephen King novels that hit Hollywood like a bad rash in 1983.
5924|0|a solid thriller - until it implodes. It gives you a savory first course, then rudely dumps seconds on your plate, even though you've already lost your appetite.
74334|1|If it were 20 minutes shorter, it would be that much closer to perfect.
51103|0|The film looks austere and serious, rather as if it had been shot inside a Frigidaire, and the oppressiveness of the images tends to strangle laughter, even at the most absurd excesses of Alvin Sargent's script.
11580|1|Anything worth doing is worth overdoing in DeMille's ponderous, yet still colossal, Biblical soap opera.
73792|1|If the film's too ready to go with the flow of Chris Doyle's handheld camerawork, and sometimes seems ad hoc, its spot-on attention to the faux pas of the moment certainly raises a smile.
41796|0|Roos and Ross (and I promise never to put those names together again) are so busy jerking the audience from wacky to teary, and back again, they seem blithely unaware of the howling melodrama of it all.
71772|0|Despite a promising setup, pic never really goes anywhere, instead immersing viewers in a kinetic onslaught of flesh (namely, that of Milla Jovovich) and flesh-eaters (most of the rest of the cast).
7142|1|Calle 54 could make you feel hot, nostalgic and possessive about this music.
19893|0|The film's direction, by Hendel Butoy and Mike Gabriel, is spectacularly inventive even when not fully appropriate to either the film's subject or the very young viewers it can be expected to attract.
49167|0|This movie is so bad, that it's almost worth seeing because it's so bad.
7104|0|She ends up being exactly what you expect a porn star to be like
18150|0|By the time Laurel Canyon closes, we're left with a number of dangling subplots, lots of questions and two hideously unbelievable reconciliations.
45240|0|The script stoops to cheap gags that undercut Affleck's efforts to sustain a believable character.
58805|1|An exhilarating and exciting motion picture.
46333|1|Arguably the most influential comedy of our time.
25420|0|Comes across like an earnest after-school special disfigured by off-putting fantasy elements and bloated with self-indulgent touches.
19721|0|Some diverting cameos, but Murphy struggles to keep this one grounded.
20853|1|With very little dancing, this is a highly entertaining, feel-good 'Blackboard Jungle'.
48650|0|Calling the picture an insult to the immune deficiency syndrome is inappropriate; however, calling the movie an act of pure idiocy is bordering generosity.
5318|1|De Niro is nervily hilarious and Grodin nervelessly exceptional in Midnight Run, a formula buddy movie exalted to insta-classic status by their performances.
38948|1|A tremendously sturdy, thoroughly unimaginative, and massively entrancing sample of the early-'30s Hollywood machine doing everything exactly right.
14261|0|The formulaic mix of mirth and mayhem is aimed way down the MTV food chain...

62270|1|Effective as a chilling horror story.
42772|0|The most disappointing thing about Apt Pupil is the lack of sustained tension generated by director Bryan Singer.
8067|1|A pleasingly jumbled mix CD
67355|1|Okay, but not the best in the series.
36372|0|The film invites us to chuckle along with Thompson as he indulges in a series of objectionalble episodes.
48544|1|It takes balls for documentary filmmaker Kirby Dick to take on the all-powerful Motional Picture Association of America (MPAA) ratings board.
10127|0|Nicholson wears his devilish grin from his first scene to last, and one has to assume that's his reaction to the enormous size of his paycheck and not the material.

2831|1|The arty blockbuster has arrived, and it's as flashy, accessorized and auto-erotic as can be. Which creates a strange sensation indeed, that it's not just the cars that are smoking, but those Wachowski brothers as well, and whatever's in their pipes too.
23018|1|The details, the personalities and the final twist grab you until you're left truly shaken and inspired.
35098|0|Written, disappointingly, by Wes Craven and his son Jonathan, this limp sequel to last year's remake of Wes' 1977 original feels like the work of a guy who's spent a few too many days lost in the desert.
30597|1|"It's merely the latest entry (and a regrettably PG-13 rated one at that) in the ""slobs vs. snobs"" comedy subgenre that dates back to the far superior Animal House."
34442|1|One of [Burton's] flat-out funniest films, with Michael Keaton giving a performance for the ages.
31059|0|The funniest part of the movie are the out-takes at the end, but those aren't worth the price of admission, wait for the DVD.
53545|1|The scenes in which Myrtle consults first one and then another spiritualist are typical of Cassavetes's genius in filming madness.
70647|0|The movie never quite shakes its stiff, studied feel, just as the town of Whistle Stop never stops seeming the quaint creation of an art director.
15353|1|In adapting Lionel Bart's lavish musical for the screen, director Carol Reed tempered the sticky sentimentality with suitably Dickensian scenes of squalor.
64571|0|'It's awful; it's just awful, gasps Marg Helgenberger in one scene of this absolutely abysmal follow-up ... viewers are likely to find their heads nodding in agreement.
75729|1|Oswald, who never graduated past B-movies and television, makes masterful use of the frame, pitting his dark thriller elements against a full-color, widescreen frame.
31119|0|Unlike its grittily romantic predecessors, Flashdance is pure glitz.
7918|1|Unfortunately, between its predictably and the absence of chemistry between Kidman and Jackman, Australia amounts to little more than an amusing if just as readily-forgettable diversion.
22216|0|A laughably disconnected hostage drama.
24287|0|All the Pretty Horses reminds me of a bad comedian telling a joke.
35036|0|Buries more characters and plot lines than it has screen time for, and fails to put to rest many of the questions it raises.
21914|1|It's hard to decide what's prettier in Russian Dolls: the people or the places. Either way, we win.
22436|0|It's as phony, stupid, lame, and pathetic as any reality show on television.
19863|0|This insipid, staggeringly dumb entry from New Line stoops to unprecedented new lows likely to stun even the most jaded cynic.
17587|1|... all the classic hallmarks of the Marx Brothers - Groucho's one-liners, musical numbers, rapid fire word play and Margaret Dumont - are present in the film
21936|1|First Contact is no grab bag of camp gewgaws; it stands proud and apart, accessible even to the Trek-deficient. This old Star, it seems, has a lot of life in it.
60900|1|If this is noir, it's the most brightly lit, least antisocial noir ever.
72203|1|Sheridan should also be applauded for keeping the film going at a nice pace, sprinkling it with many lighter moments, as well as one of the more suspenseful scenes from any movie last year.
54166|0|One of the worst films I've ever seen.
46278|0|The plot is so convoluted that missing even five minutes at a stretch won't make any difference in your comprehension of the story.
49173|1|The Minimoys are teeny-weeny kind folk with a keen fashion sense and a wicked-cool lair. They're just like what the Borrowers would have been like if they had lived in the field behind the Urban Outfitters production factory.
17842|0|Doesn't summon up quite enough quirky personality to maintain its momentum through the final act.
36085|0|A dopey, totally disposable grade B thriller.
44828|1|If you haven't seen this film yet, stop reading and seek it out.
14920|0|That is essentially what's missing from Blackboards -- the sense of something bigger, some ultimate point.
61122|1|Wildly funny in spots...
66460|1|One of the greatest films to emerge from the Italian neorealist movement.
18299|1|May or may not rank with Hitch's greatest masterpieces, but its premise offers perhaps the most compelling variation on his favorite theme, the innocent man wrongly accused.
27625|1|This is one of the most original and unsettling horror movies to come out of America during its B-movie saturated, drive-in friendly period.
7856|0|Maximum Risk equals minimum impact -- even by Van Damme standards.
22367|1|Not only is it an elegantly polished affair, with top notch performances all round, and magnificent camerawork and editing, it's also acutely aware of how class, money and sex shape desire and resentment.
6304|1|...one of Disney's most beautiful, most spectacular visual treats, even if the story line and characters are watered-down children's fare.
1009|1|...the film at once seems like a visually dynamic conflation of a Robert Flaherty film and a proto-neorealist fable comprised of photogenic locals and working class heroics.
68588|1|For the way it gave me room to ponder, for the gift of its colors, and for the delicate performance by Zhang Ziyi... it's one of my favorite films of 2001.
35294|1|Given the era of this movie, it was a controversial topic and a theme that Kramer handles courageously. He does a good job of showcasing Poitier and Curtis in their prime and the film's Oscar-winning cinematography is crisp and outstanding.
7848|1|Yes, You've Got Mail isn't strikingly profound or groundbreaking, but it's one of these movies that just make you feel real good.
4503|1|Watching this delectably humane road movie incites the same emotions as discovering the works of Truffaut
65389|0|This little film tries too hard to charm, and in the process loses its bite.
38252|0|I can forgive the Oscar- winning makeover, but not the script-doctored romance
62904|1|The beautiful shots of San Francisco's lush Telegraph Hill are captivating by themselves, but the film's greatest achievement is its humanity.
77539|0|The story is moving, and the animation includes some powerful images, although some of the early scenes depicting the suffering of the mice in Russia may be too frightening for younger viewers.
9964|1|Problematic, troubling, dangerous even, but breathtakingly original, and absolutely true to the times. The cutting edge doesn't get any sharper than this.
30592|1|Frankenheimer propels this tale of intrigue through its tightly plotted paces with such conviction that he even makes an action hero out of Robert De Niro.
7903|0|"Not just horrid by itself, this opened the floodgates for all those self-absorbed indie ""relationship"" comedies of the latter 1990s."
9602|0|Marci X is the kind of terrible movie I'm almost glad I've seen, because this decade probably won't bring a worse movie than this.
12484|1|What is most remarkable about this film is the fidelity it retains to Seuss' work and intentions.
17238|1|Resolutely not boring.
8753|0|Screenwriter Gina Wendkos, working from Meg Cabot's novel, resorts to monotonous movie clich√©s: almost uniformly cruel classmates and a callous, cacophonous mob of media jackals.
76447|1|Director and star Kenneth Branagh brings the same zest and bravura style to this actors' romp of a mystery-thriller as he did to Henry V.
16804|1|To say that El Cid is the most intelligent of the elephantine epics of the early '60s is to damn it with faint praise.
67343|0|It is like reading the Arabian Nights at one sitting, with only six minutes allowed to stretch the limbs and get the contrast of a workaday world.
52950|1|...a thoughtful thematic treatise on cultivation and learning and a charming character study of two lost souls from different worlds finding a common need in one another.
10014|1|Carrey is excellent in the lead role supplying both vulnerability and wit...
77721|0|I found it slow, predictable and not very amusing.
77808|1|savage whimsy
1880|1|The cast includes Frank Sinatra, Montgomery Clift and Ernest Borgnine, all of whom are fine, in what is essentially a melodrama.
27204|0|Everything old is old again in this rickety extension of 2002's already rickety Van Wilder.

63552|0|Director/co-writer Robert Zemeckis has undeniable energy and flair, but it's being misspent on pretexts and situations that seem inexcusably gratuitous and snide.
10369|0|[Whenever] Hurley disappears, and so does much of the film's energy.
14895|1|The Cosby touch (he's co-writer and co-executive producer) is in full effect, schmaltz notwithstanding, as Albert and the gang run through their series of pleasantly diverting escapades.
34624|1|The film is quite an ambitious and stylized biopic, spanning decades and capturing the world of concert performance where time stops and sensory perception become excruciatingly magnified.
20008|1|we won't be awarding points for originality, but sometimes the familiar can be just fine
19294|1|A smart, ironic documentary.
20984|1|From the clever Jaws take-off opening to the final, irreverent title card, laughs come thick and fast.
72406|0|Jack Frost is so treacly and fake it makes you feel like you're trapped in a winter-wonderland paperweight.
1999|1|The film engages with the divergent paths taken, linked by childhood friendship and a mewling kitten, but a third act event is presented so abruptly it confuses the viewer until it rebounds somewhat with a satisfying closure.
61840|0|It has stylish fighting, but the story doesn't live up to the talent of the fight choreographer.
58059|1|A fairly entertaining chase flick, with a few artistic touches included to keep the thinking viewers happy.
24334|1|Sure in essence it's formula and pretty much just a romantic comedy, but [the film] is a sex fueled hilarious teen comedy/road flick...
62086|1|Both leads look terrific.
14417|1|A riot, and Joe Dante's most touchingly personal movie at the same time.
6201|0|This fairytale of the civil rights era is all honey and no sting.
75082|1|A slight tale, charmingly told.
13841|1|Quiz Show' is a uniquely American tragedy, told with subtlety and complexity.
67495|0|What does Brian Levant have against the stars of Boyz N the Hood? First Cuba Gooding Jr. in Snow Dogs, now Cube and Nia Long in one fell swoop.
20128|0|Whatever ambitions this romantic comedy might have had, they were never realized.
3930|1|Fly's heartbreaking drama about a man who inherits a ton of power and buckets of sorrow will tell you all you need to know about the soul-destroying nature of corporate culture.
3231|1|Where the Money Is has a preposterous plot, but it's not about a plot, it's about acting.
19489|1|An imaginative, entertaining crime mystery with plenty of nerve and vigor.
34510|1|Decent, but hardly original, the film has enough moments and decent performances to keep things interesting.
56002|1|Lively romantic comedy with its incisive depiction of sibling rivalry and sexual politics.
56493|0|As predictable as the sun rising.
794|1|He makes you endure the grossest of the gross and you still laugh through the whole thing
6935|1|"As for Mr. Cusack, there's nothing potential about his stardom any more. He's the self-doubting, self-flagellating, self-ironic soul of ""High Fidelity,"" and he's great."
66066|1|Marsh has a knack for setting up twisted situations, and he nicely counterbalances the horror by filming everything in a straightforward, muted style.
16373|1|A great film. Considers genuine personalities and extreme feelings, and lingers in the mind, holding some kind of spell over us long after it has ended.
20246|0|Waters is trying to have his cake and eat it out too.
77968|1|. In sharp contrast to most of the farces around these days, this film allows us to relax and enjoy the story without worrying about being clobbered over the head by gross-out gags.
52543|0|An odd, odd (did I say odd) portrait of a serial killer set against a backdrop that is plum smack in the middle of white bread, Ozzie and Harriet, America.
13113|0|With this journey into the heart of rubbish, this full-throttle adventure into the hyper-space of drivel, Travolta not only incinerates what is left of his own reputation, but takes someone else down with him.
38331|1|A smart, adult thriller...
50303|1|A terrific seriocomic crime caper that nobody knew how to sell. Often feels like a 1970s movie that somehow ended up in 1989.
46225|0|A special-effects bonanza, and a woefully underwhelming one at that.
13715|1|Tarantino has a blast with this affectionate nod to '70s exploitation flicks, but the dialogue isn't as good as it should have been.
15665|1|This is Jack at his best, the kind of role that makes him a star. He gets to bear his teeth, take control of a room, and be devilishly cuddly at the same time.
50603|1|It's a garrulous, effervescent movie - not my favourite Hawks picture, but very likable all the same.
73851|0|Purporting to look at the roots of modern-day anti-Semitism, Levin only has eyes for a well-worn checklist of Jew-haters and oppressors, his shoddy search for answers turning up not a single one.
28438|1|It's a wonder that so stark and minimal a film can create such potent feelings, images and moments that linger so persistently, divine intimations that seem so inescapable.

49439|1|The interplay between the two leads is pure gold.
45747|1|Film noir at its best, with an intriguing blend of law and order, sin and sex, violence and sado-masochism.
67278|0|As shameless as trashy cookie-cutter studios movies will ever get.
78646|0|It neither glamorizes nor demonizes truck-stop whoredom; it merely depicts it, with little of the internal strife that ought to accompany it.
28462|1|A great Hollywood classic!
14288|1|These characters and their quest began to grow on me, and by the time the movie was over I cared very much about how their lives would turn out.

3796|1|[An] inordinately clever, sprightly romantic comedy.
3800|0|If lots and lots of shooting and wrassling and growling turns your crank, then you might have a good time with Skinwalkers; otherwise, it's a total snore.
64223|1|The movie exudes an inescapable realism. Unlike a pastiche of newsreel footage, however, Spielberg craftily imbues Steven Zaillian's masterful screenplay with an emotionally charged examination of calculated brutality.
74211|1|De Broca (who also co-wrote with Jean Cosmos) gives it a frisky energy.
56792|1|The film takes us so deeply into this shabby, transient world that we feel its texture -- both its scary thrills and its bleak, fatalistic uncertainty.

35632|0|Scenes begin with an amusing premise and a few laughs, but quickly fizzle as the jokes become increasingly one-note.
54814|0|The script by Bernard Gordon and Cliff Gould is a man-made disaster.
75180|1|The scope is especially impressive given that the movie is about a society obsessively focused on the tiniest of details.
33015|0|A Romantic Comedy without a bit of romantic chemistry or a solitary laugh . . . the most ill-concieved idea since they made Schwarznegger pregnant.
7864|1|Cameron Crowe creates a beautiful film filled with uncertainties and paints romance as horrifying, but an experience that's also very much worth it.
74057|1|What in different hands would have been a bombastic psychological thriller becomes a stark study of existential alienation.
45461|1|Despite its frequently maddening lapses in logic and time frame, Jacob`s Ladder transcends most script ills to become a haunting and truly chilling thriller-melodrama.

4383|0|David Lean's studied, plodding, overanalytic direction manages to kill most of the meaning in E.M. Forster's haunting novel of cultural collision in colonial India.
10938|0|Director Rob Schmidt photographs the action in that visually clich√©d, MTV-influenced manner now de rigeur in much of independent cinema.
50479|1|This is a movie rich in moral ambiguities and one which should thoroughly please voyeurs and detective story enthusiasts alike.
3122|1|The camaraderie between the two principal actors is almost as appealing as it was in Butch Cassidy.
10116|1|Given how thoroughly all the subtext spells out the message, then, it seems unnecessary to make the actual text so raw, grotesque and graphic.
48998|1|By removing the sorcery and operatic excess so synonymous with the story, the filmmakers conjure an affecting, pretty melodrama... with the emphasis more on mellow than drama.
25970|0|A badly acted, unoriginal, irritating movie...Easily one of the worst films of 2001.
13232|0|"In the end, everyone learns to do the ""right"" thing and, essentially, fulfills his or her standardized role in society."
24336|1|A crazily mesmerizing pop artifact that ranks alongside Herman Hesse's novel Siddhartha in terms of extreme earnestness and quasi-religious entertainment value.

55715|1|It was much more thought-provoking than I was expecting, but his blatant bias made me feel that he was no less a fundamentalist than the religious people he was criticising.
45314|0|Stuttering like a busted console, the film's lack of invention is only rivalled by a paucity of gore which will seem positively comical to gamers long since inured to cyberspace slaughter.
3606|1|Stallone more than holds his own against an all-star ensemble cast; indeed, he soundly anchors the picture.
36059|1|"[Blu-ray Review] An elegantly photographed, legitimately frightening tale that does not shirk away from its controversial concepts. The high-def release of ""Prince of Darkness"" receives my full, unequivocal recommendation."
3775|1|The Titanic has a haunting beauty that is served well by the movie's 3-dimensional process.
23867|1|Never was Mike Hammer's name more fitting than in Kiss Me Deadly, Robert Aldrich's blisteringly nihilistic noir.

142|0|These fighting-intensive movies, a glorification of hurtful action, are strictly for children. While the corpse count is low, the mimicking turtles stand for nothing more important than the employment of physical force.

66630|1|An unexpected delight.

64357|1|By the time you get to see the fourth incarnation of any movie franchise, you should be pretty sure what you're in for %u2013 and this one is true to its brand. It's corny, mischievous and more than a tad tacky in places.
55273|0|Leviathan is intermittently interesting, but it's a bad sign that the movie starts losing its punch when the monster shows up.
45742|1|Not a great movie, but in its own way it is an effective one, and more than most other movies it is accurate and honest about the sexuality of young people.
31248|0|Unfortunately, Vaughn repeatedly crosses the line between persuasively playing an obnoxious character and coming across as nerve-gratingly self-indulgent.

16601|1|In Anthony Drazan's enjoyably offbeat Zebrahead, racial definition is the least important thing about anybody.
19336|1|This charming film (aka Handle With Care) was a commercial failure, but it holds up well and resonates more strongly when examined vis-a-vis Demme's other communal films, Melvin and Howard and Something Wild.
62475|1|It's a ridiculous, absurd slasher film with a concept that is so bad that it's undoubtedly good and makes for some wicked entertainment.
4200|1|Drew Barrymore gives an excellent performance as a lady-in-waiting opposite Jimmy Fallon's equally-impressive portrayal of a jittery, baseball-obsessed beau.
32013|0|My reaction was that this was a bit silly, bordering on stupid, and much to my chagrin, it became a theme throughout the rest of the movie.
3290|0|Bad acting, dumb dialogue, and confusing cinematography abound, creating one of the most shoddy Camelot stories to date.
17252|1|This isn't really a documentary so much as a celebration -- of one word's power to twist people in knots.
49696|0|Broderick's sunny spin on the deeply flawed Taylor is interesting but eventually defies belief. In the third act, Finding Amanda loses steam altogether.

46694|1|Kazan's Biblical allegory has not held up well, but Dean's performance, for which he was Oscar-nominated posthumously, proves why he became a star after his very first film
22281|1|The humour seems to be aimed more at adults, which is good news for those being dragged along by their children, and even though it's disappointing, there's still plenty to smile at.
42178|1|Visually, Tess is a masterpiece, capturing in amazing detail the scenery and atmosphere of the England of yore. The film's chief drawback, however, is its lack of vitality.
16279|1|Only a director who truly knows repression could have made a movie so subtle and so understanding.
67280|1|Too good to miss.
1415|1|Surreal Disney classic with wild-card characters.
54299|0|Too delighted with its own cleverness.
9763|1|From James Toback's crackling script to Warren Beatty's electric performance as gangster Ben Siegel, Bugsy is so engrossing that you feel uncharitable mentioning that while splendid in individual scenes, Barry Levinson's movie lacks propulsion.

50462|0|I prefer to think of this movie as The Critic Who Cried.
10925|1|I felt transported back to the 1960s films of Jean-Luc Godard. I was watching a film that was not afraid of its audience.
46597|0|If I understand the ending properly, [this] is an infomercial for one or another school of New Age-y psychology/philosophy. ... a touchy-feely ultraviolent gangster flick. Come over here and give Scarface a hug, you big gruff pussycat.
13121|0|Hey Arnold is a film that kids and adults will enjoy.
66386|0|Based on a short story by the great nutball sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick, Screamers is more like a high-pitched rip-off of Alien.
4298|1|This is a quintessential blaxploitation film. And it's fun as hell to watch.
74383|0|Director Shankman ditches character development in favour of delivering an exploitative date movie and dubiously conservative moral lesson.

68287|1|Powerful look at the Holocaust through teen eyes.
2222|1|If a part of me has resisted and sometimes even resented his mastery, this undoubtedly can be traced to a problem with realism that his work as a whole throws into relief. To put it crudely, why reproduce the real world when we have the thing itself?

22885|1|A slight, sleekly polished debut feature propelled by a kinder, gentler Swingers vibe.

56688|0|The film doesn't gather the emotional momentum that would make it compelling as well as impressive.
61335|1|Perhaps a touch on the corny side and undeniably broad, Kid is a ridiculously rewarding drama that puts pure sincerity to marvelous use, inflating a mild underdog story into an inspiring tale of education and developing friendship.
19671|1|Exuding charm, charisma and managing to convey a darker side to Bond without ever resorting to Timothy Dalton's pouty approach, [Brosnan] became the first actor to give Connery a run for his money.

45298|1|Though hardly earth-shakingly original, Van Sant's low-budget movie takes a cool, contemplative and sometimes comic look at American drug-culture.
17501|1|Much is unemphatic, but all of it carries the moving weight of conviction. And it ends on a healing grace-note which passeth all understanding.
7060|1|like Eraserhead updated for the slasher generation, Basket Case is a deranged psychodrama, full of gleefully gory set-pieces, quirky humour, and some impossibly moving pathos.
15433|1|Woody doing a musical? OK, it's a bit uneven, but the all-star cast holds it together. Goldie Hawn is a delight.
6954|1|The animation is fairly unexciting though serviceable, and the overall mystification of class difference would probably have made Dickens shudder, but kids should find this tolerable enough.

51418|1|The gimmicky premise keeps this tension-filled scarefest afloat.
17923|0|As fun as talking babies were, the buck stops here with talking dogs. Gone is the witty humour and sexual innuendo of the first film, and in it's place is a script just ripe for any 8 year old, but stale to anyone in the double digits.

58950|1|One of the collest gunslinger movies of the new generation.
16885|1|Stuart Gordon's low-budget thriller is so compellingly perverse that it transcends its humble premise.

46625|0|These snippets about people falling in love or changing each other's lives in a few hours don't have enough soul or depth to add up to much more than zero.
81407|1|Rises above its own shortcomings through Heath Ledger's electric embodiment of Ned.
49327|0|Since director Iain Softley seems more interested in establishing tone and atmosphere than in creating vital personalities, he is unable to harness the full power of his story.
17024|1|Yes, there is wonder here, and plenty of it.
4545|0|The seventh Trek extravaganza emerges as a disappointment, slightly better than the inept Star Trek V but markedly inferior to Parts II and VI.
52451|0|Polish Wedding an embarrassment to all concerned!
59107|1|Powerful, but only for 17 and up.
77012|1|The action is flashy and intermittent, deliberately wallowing in a mire of revisionist grot, churned up vistas of European mud. Time has made it more intuitive and caustic a film, than its daft reputation might suggest.
54612|1|No matter how well Levin had made this film, there will still be those who will accept the Protocols and other bogus documents as fact. Still, it's reassuring to know that somebody has the courage to challenge the lies and to examine why they've been so s
46857|1|Perfect. Simple as.
17683|0|Balancing the elements of comedy and drama are never easy and Metro, Eddie Murphy's latest flick, proves how easy it is to mistep.
1710|1|...a good mystery, with some thought-provoking observations on the effects of war on the hearts and minds of its participants.
73833|1|It stands as a clear precursor for such revered love-on-the-run films as Bonnie and Clyde, Badlands and They Live By Night, but is perhaps better than any of them.
35250|1|Essential viewing today for anyone interested in the history of celluloid science fiction, but general audiences will most likely find it to be dull.
14015|1|It's worth noting that the footage was manipulated ... in post-production, but this unbroken take still functions as a documentary record of an exceptional logistical feat.
26986|0|Mr. Magoo is transcendently bad. It soars above ordinary badness as the eagle outreaches the fly. There is not a laugh in it. Not one.
59881|1|We are not talking postmodern or even modern here, but the best kind of old-fashioned.
5990|0|The film is vampire roadkill.
5186|0|The brothers swamp the fragile story and characters with such a deluge of CGI tricks and elaborate action sequences that it proves hard to care about the humans on screen.
66837|0|It never lives up to the potential of its premise about a centuries-old war between rival clans of vampires and werewolves.
14996|0|Enough of the Bears already! Even Matthau bailed out.
46639|1|What a pack of trashy people these accomplished actors perform!
12678|1|At once a charming entertainment, a resonant character study, an ironic morality tale, and a bittersweet celebration of Montmartre.
11112|1|Mamet loves the interplay of words, rife with sharp exchanges and ready witticisms
79560|0|It does have a glossy sci-fi wrapper, but the quality of the underlying production is a pure B movie exercise in terror.
59357|1|Chicken Run is a charmingly conceived entertainment. But it's a little bit twee.
8417|1|I think this is the best Potter film yet, for one simple reason: it's not like a Harry Potter film.
11642|1|It is challenging but simultaneously exhilarating as we travel through this never-waking nightmare.
30678|1|Gorgeous, sumptuous, and slow as an arthritic turtle.
41865|1|It is a finely detailed manners study of the superwealthy, a drama of conflicting principles and values and an engrossing legal detective story.
10471|1|It is Bresson's unadorned, almost ascetic style that lifts the tale beyond a genre piece.
68683|1|Spielberg blows stuff up better than anyone -- he proves himself the maestro of that by-now-degraded game.
14345|1|Sweet but a bit dull...Overall, the picture is good-hearted and colorful, with an ending that carries a nice touch of ambiguity about the tussle of nature and nurture. [Blu-ray]
67643|1|It looks and sounds as if it came out of the Disney Studios of the '40s or '50s. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing -- that's as much a compliment (in terms of the quality of animation) as it is a criticism.
10269|0|Perhaps writer-director Geoffrey Wright meant to show this motley crew as doomed from the start, but this obvious dead-end attitude also makes the group's repulsive antics all the more predictable.
44892|0|"Against the Ropes ... is ""inspired"" by Kallen's life but ultimately has as much to do with her story as Schindler's List did with the War of 1812."
46591|1|Although some say Wayne's Oscar was given out of sympathy instead of his performance, he still acts well as the sheriff who's past his peak.
35411|1|The members manage to pronounce KOK exactly as you think they might, thus giving the cast ample opportunity to use that term as often as possible. It's very Beavis and Butthead, yet always seems to elicit a chuckle.
39630|0|As a satirist, [Stone's] an elephant ballerina.
24929|1|A prophetic scald
28334|1|Skillfully performed and welcomely unpredictable, this low-budget crime film, made by actor turned director Carl Franklin, starts out as a herky-jerky exploitation piece, then turns into something better.
2885|1|Uplifting as only a document of the worst possibilities of mankind can be, and among the best films of the year.
45711|1|If it is emotional cinema you seek then this, my friends, is for you.
66115|0|Not only is the picture woefully short on laughs, it's also coarse, overbearing and, in places, downright insulting.
65785|1|You really should see this movie, even though it will make you sick.
77257|0|Tries too hard to be funny in a way that's too loud, too goofy and too short of an attention span.
76128|1|...lacks a strong, clearly defined villainous presence. Still, Eastwood's flinty-eyed stare and snarling lip are more than enough.
58177|0|Director Ron Howard brings a quality of gentleness and whimsy to the performances, but basically this is a highly calculated project brought in by those two old pros, producers Richard Zanuck and David Brown.
74458|1|An otherworldly tale of childhood and a definitive work of imagination.
19543|0|"Viewing the earthbound sequences in ""Grind"" is like watching the dialogue portions of pornos. Pity the viewers who catch this one without the benefit of a fast-forward or chapter select button."
2404|1|Ferrara was in the right place at the right time to make Bad Lieutenant.
30860|0|The characters have no wit or charm, the plot has no conflict or development, nothing happens for any reason other than script requirements.
48827|0|There are a lot of movies struggling to get out of Crazy in Alabama, and most of them are bad.
14500|1|The best thing about Gansel's film is it doesn't ask you to absolve anyone; it only tries to make everyone a little more human.
81375|0|Movies like this one just sort of float around for a few weeks like a thin cloud, then slowly dissipate. Most people probably won't even remember it was in theaters when it shows up on the video rack three months from now.
5006|0|Sincerity and brevity can be virtues, but they don't do enough for Yossi & Jagger.
74703|1|Kubrick keeps the elegant black-and-white film big and luxurious and barren and sustains the cold humor.
57082|0|Director Raymond De Felitta's clinical visual treatment renders the tone too cold.
5173|1|Charming, explicit love story for mature teens.
30293|1|Most of the characters are two-dimensional embodiments of commonplace attitudes, and few of the narrative developments gather much momentum.
48434|0|This plodding, one-paced, dramatically inert movie is almost entirely surface description.
33181|0|A curiously ponderous affair, with an excess of pop psychology character background and cod-Eastern mysticism and not enough fun or action.
6417|1|One of Fritz Lang's very best films.
134|0|Roger Moore is a pastry chef's idea of James Bond; but Christopher Lee as the archetype of the evil antagonist makes this 007 outing just about bearable.
15895|1|[Ritchie] directs scenes for comedy even in the face of his disturbing material and that makes the movie all the more effective; sometimes we laugh, and sometimes we can't, and the movie's working best when we're silent.
66881|1|A clever concept indie with old timey zip.
72336|1|Despite the sponginess of the content, Hutton's extraordinary film acting debut ought to assure his famous novice director a long, successful career behind the camera.
30307|0|This movie has a nostalgic retro feel to it, like the old Universal horror movies that we now find very funny. But alas, where are all the drive-in theaters to show it in?
35532|0|If Sheridan didn't feel the need to pile on the pedantic subtexts, this would be an absorbing personal drama, rather than a vituperative, question-begging broadside.
48585|1|Vanessa Redgrave has never been more likable on screen than in her buoyantly athletic turn here.
5184|1|Bernardo Bertolucci's 1972 masterpiece of post-modern existential angst is an irrefutable art film that attempts to reconcile a depth of social existence through its sexually liberated characters.
68237|1|Some of the best fight sequences one can expect to see in this genre.
10359|1|This film feels truly lived in, and guides us without ever feeling manipulative or calculating. The performances are naturalistic and utterly convincing.
16815|1|Wolfen is a thriller with a metaphysical side to it.
65071|0|"Blank screamers, fastidiously amplified ""boos,"" and the most confused intimations of lesbianism since High Tension"
11764|1|One of the best American horror films in years.
5809|0|I don't see this slightly better-than-average drug thriller, with slightly better-than-average direction by Steven Soderbergh, as anything more than a routine rubber-stamping of genre reflexes.
30830|0|All-in-all, what we have here is 'classic' Seagal. And that means, for anyone who isn't an admitted fan, an uninspired outing.
19435|1|Comedy horror that really does give Vincent Price a chance to do his stuff, with deliciously absurd results.
11170|0|There ought to be a directing license, so that Ed Burns can have his revoked.
65446|1|Be prepared to laugh from the opening credits through the closing credits.
55262|0|Classic soap opera in which good old British understatement has a field day, everybody is frightfully nice, and sentimentality is wrapped up in yards of tasteful gloss.
34946|0|A capitalist wet dream; one that we have long since woken up from screaming.
78146|1|Fails to live up to the high expectations involuntarily set by such reputable talent.
13306|1|Tom Hanks directorial effort is a decent film overall, but nothing that would ever inspire to re-visit again and again with fondness.
7754|1|Nothing that hasn't been done before in Hollywood, and in many cases better.
20284|0|Ritchie may not have a novel thought in his head, but he knows how to pose Madonna.
58282|1|Profoundly and sensitively balances the private demons of scarred veterans and the press of public policies that leave their mark on daily life.
12642|1|A dry yet whimsical touch, specifically British and also aware of cinematic tradition
5162|0|Rather than putting a modern stamp on a reliable product, The Honeymooners renders one of the most distinctive formulas in television history entirely anonymous.
50209|1|The 25-year-old flick still feels as if it was made tomorrow.
1521|0|Hopefully, I've now prevented three people from seeing this film, and now they will each prevent three other people from doing the same.
40678|0|Ultimately, it didn't move me in any way.
42215|1|...this one has heart.
51775|1|The original inspirational-teacher story, and a beloved valentine to classical education, tradition, and the English public boarding schools of a bygone era.
3070|1|In spite of its faults, Lurie's film cannot be easily dismissed.
14735|1|Stereotype-based satire; not for young kids.
64890|1|The friendship between town and country boys Lee and Gibson is real and personal, and the final shot transcends cliche.
13713|1|A blistering thriller and an intelligent character study and a comic take-off on the conventions of thrillers.
28087|1|This special effects extravaganza is s good star vehicle for Jim Carrey, exhibiting his skills and his shticks; in a small part, the sexy Cameron Diaz is bound to become a leading lady.
38384|1|It's hard to complain of having too much going on, and the film is certainly extremely well crafted, but it's too ambitious and never quite meets its goals.
16983|1|The minute The Searchers begins, it's impossible to look away.
61206|1|Writer/director Minghella's second feature brings ambivalence and a touch of realpolitik to the stuff of candyfloss romance.
33546|0|What's at work here is the comedy law of diminishing returns: if you tell the same jokes over and over and over again, they become less and less and less funny.
66395|1|It has an integrity to the kinkiness of its theme that doesn't shake loose but you'll get more out of it if you bring your analyst along with you.
14685|1|I wasn't able to get reasonably straight about it for quite a while. I still think it has a good deal of charm and quality, enough natural talent involved in it to make ten pictures ten times as good, and terrific vitality or, rather, vigor.
43752|1|The movie isn't great art, but it has been made with great taste and style; it's more intelligent and observant than movie biographies of singing stars used to be.
73005|1|Naked ladies may be the enticement, but the main attraction of Mrs. Henderson Presents is Dench and Hoskins squabbling like the old married couple that they aren't.
883|0|It's disreputable, occasionally ludicrous and merely kinda fun.
49987|0|Despite some creepy scenes and superb special effects, Mirrors is let down by a ludicrous script and some dodgy acting, though it remains watchable on a so-bad-it's-good level.
16509|1|The Sandlot is just a fun, funny film that holds plenty of family appeal because it has a wholesome Norman Rockwell vibe and, as with any good sports film, you don't have to love the game to love the film.
5046|0|Only the reliably funny Jon Lovitz delivers his lines with any aplomb, providing just a few laughs in this otherwise horrid movie.
77624|1|A bit far-fetched perhaps, but much comedy is.
46358|0|Often a one-note joke that goes on way too long...
3802|1|Comfortably cheesy -- a real beer-and-pizza movie.
37381|1|... ends in one heck of an action sequence....
14407|0|The movie is nothing if not predictable.
33914|1|Gangsters, tap dancers, and jazz musicians collide!
18339|1|Screwy but fascinating.
81207|0|Thematically, this WWII drama is a typical John Wayne fare--the Duke imparts lessons of manhood and honor--but technically, it's an atypical Preminger movie, slow-paced and shapeless.
31041|0|Hill has obviously tried to make a hip, ultra-violent actioneer, but what he ends up with is more a choppy, ultimately boring pastiche involving endless shots of automatic weapons fire and peoples' legs pumping furiously as they scramble...
13364|1|Cary Grant's performance is truly virtuoso -- stunning technique applied to the most challenging material.
1098|0|I've never seen a film -- whether it was based on a book, a play, or in this case a timeless legend -- treat its source material with such cavalier disregard.
14381|1|Robert Redford's beguiling drama reminds us even the most hopeless causes can be turned around through the power of positive thinking and perserverance, if we're willing to embrace the possibility of success instead of the probability of failure.
49866|1|Linear storytelling was never Herzog's strong suit even under the best of conditions. His strength lies in capturing lucid lunacy on film, and Manoel da Silva's descent into the jaws of madness is a straight shot into the heart of darkness.
11112|1|There are harrowing moments: who could not be moved by a parent talking about a son's suicide? But you do not leave the cinema with a better understanding of suicide.
599|1|The execution is reasonably funny in the hit-and-miss manner of latter-day episodes, but translating The Simpsons to the big screen is a pointless exercise.
25113|1|The best of all 80s teen movies.
32678|1|The genius of Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice is that it understands the peculiar nature of the moral crisis for Americans in this age group, and understands that the way to consider it is in a comedy.
75675|1|...the movie becomes a giddy, kiddie inversion of time and space.
8907|0|Comic desperation can be seen at alarmingly frequent intervals.
20946|1|Action!
12785|0|Offensive, vile, and, even worse, not funny.
80651|1|Stylish, funny, and fun to watch (and quite morbid at times), and even offers relevant insight into the conditions created by the Thai economy.
15974|0|The movie is more concerned with mounting big screen infotainment and sidebar issues like the lure of 'that adrenalin rush and nonstop erection of fear and war,' than making sense of the confounding stage of world history.
12914|1|...back upon its original 1981 release, it was a true 'wow,' a filmic equivalent of the post-punk new wave music scene that was current.
50350|1|One of the last examples of the imaginative -- but often monstrous -- grandeur of the Golden Period of the German film, Metropolis is a spectacular example of Expressionist design.
18172|1|One has to say this for The Man Who Fell to Earth: such a bold, imaginative work would never get made in today's fettered, cautious film industry, either here or in America. Roeg's work may have its faults - but its ambition is beyond reproach.
73602|1|As the detective-story flashback structure gets under way, what initially seemed adherence to dramatic and moral clich√© becomes more complex and interesting.
14935|1|...this dark meditation on justice and the lack of it may be his best film.
75373|1|Diaz, in particular, gives a career-best performance, although the film-makers hedge their bets by having her appear either semi-naked or skimpily-dressed in almost every scene.
28405|1|A revenge drama, with Lange's Bette pulling the strings.
13661|1|A rousingly effective 'man versus beast' yarn in the great tradition of Jaws and Moby Dick.
19667|0|The film is beautifully photographed like a Hallmark tourist postcard...
51577|1|You want a story? Read the front page. I'm here for the picture show.
77717|0|Gorlin's vignettes work only in fits and starts, and his plodding pace makes 96 minutes seem like so many hours.
10068|1|The pace never slows, the jokes never miss and the stunts never disappoint in this macho-dream of an actioner.
16018|0|...Mainly a collection of dumb sight gags, gross-out jokes, and comic sex, with a dull-as-dishwater premise and a spotty cast list.
31232|1|An amazing and unshakeable experience.
78985|0|Dull spy story
44700|1|In something beyond drama and melodrama, diluted American mythos makes for Euro cine refined.
65381|1|Flaky effervescence
22182|0|Visually impressive, but I thought it was never going to end.
19910|0|A conventional Cold War thriller whose flatness keeps it from being as suspenseful as it should be.
6570|1|juggles the tones and genre shifts with an impressive deftness that makes it feel all of a piece even though, in many ways, it is all over the place
19012|1|The old energy and bite may be lacking, but at least this lazy, amiable shaggy-dog story was made in the same freewheeling, idiosyncratic way as Altman's best work.
21460|1|More about the alchemical nature of movies than the band or their music, the picture is among the very best of the year.
15314|1|Beautiful and funny.
2067|0|Your kids may enjoy it, but you would do better to wait for the video.
43642|1|Welles applied his bravura directorial style to Kafka's landmark 1925 novel about Joseph K (Perkins), an office clerk who gets arrested without being told why.
4454|0|A movie so shamelessly derivative of so many other movies that it ought to have a work-cited page at the start of the closing credits.
49320|1|Still manages to trigger disgust and a handful of laughs, representing not only a key Troma financial victory, but it's quite possibly their finest original work.
12777|1|The mother lode of the horror genre, this German Expressionist movie is directed by Robert Wiene and presents a full smorgasbord of pop-eyed terror, lunatics, murderers and possessed somnambulists in its eerie shadows.
75985|0|If you've seen the first one there's a lingering sense of d√©ja vu about it all.
14397|1|This glorified soap opera, filled with a higher caste of desperate souls, makes Brideshead worth the revisit.
18477|0|"Hammy performances by Charlton Heston as John the Baptist, Telly Savalas as Pilate, and, in the most notorious bit of casting, John Wayne(!) as a Roman soldier overseeing the crucifixion (""Truly, this man was the son of God,"" drawls the Duke)."
54457|0|This film brings nothing new to the table, but rather just regurgitates every formulaic driven cop-against-the evil drug empire clich√© that has come before.
7703|1|I miss Peter Jackson in his ultra low-budget horror mode. He always looked like he was having fun. Not half as good as Dead Alive, but still a hoot.
17722|0|Ferrara is so obsessed with giving King of New York an artsy, edgy, improvisational feel that he doesn't seem to realize what he has here is really just another angry gangster picture.
9226|0|This negligible comedy might as well come with a bouncing ball so members of the audience can recite the dialogue along with the actors.
54184|1|An entertaining, clever black comedy!
27739|1|What a lot of fun is The Witches. A few days before Labor Day, it is safe to say that it`s the most enjoyable movie of the summer.
18520|0|... for all its social and political potential, State Property doesn't end up being very inspiring or insightful.
30224|0|Dull adventure about Greek gods, despite Ray Harryhausen effects
26363|0|Joins I Stand Alone and Funny Games on the list of maddeningly recondite European films that exploit the violence-in-media subtext to hide their sick, voyeuristic fantasies.
28654|1|Ira & Abby has plenty of sharp details, mostly verbal, and it gives old pros and newer faces a chance to show off their poker-faced comic wiles.
12397|0|One can only hope that Daniel Stern got paid per humiliaiton.
61722|1|Powerful portrait of one young girl's valient effort to survive the cruel and tense world of adolescence.
57496|1|Trumping the first sequel, and approaching the quality of the original, High School Musical 3: Senior Year is a truly winning reprise.
30232|1|Invigorating, bombastic, out-there and very funny.
62840|1|...How a formulaic laff riot with a risqu√© slant is done.
64664|1|An enjoyable kid spy spoof with likeable characters.
43167|1|"With his thrilling new documentary portrait of his hometown -- or rather, his new ""docu-fantasia"" -- Guy Maddin proves that you can go home again."
31211|0|The whole film, with its steady, important-picture pacing, its foursquare visual style, and its pseudo-profundity, is a piece of glorified banality.
33596|0|...a cheap, amateurish attempt to cash in on the National Lampoon name.
13884|0|Barely distinguishable from other recent mob flicks like Analyze This.
34327|0|The whole production feels cut and pasted, and it doesn't translate well to the big screen...
43962|1|Gives Angela Bassett the full star treatment, and she gives it right back.
39289|1|Violent, liberal George Clooney Gulf War caper.
35973|1|Will Smith charms again; best for teens and up.
38076|0|Lousy movie with a catchy titles
78935|1|Penn's task is well-served not only by a superb cast but the efforts of first-rate collaborators.
51702|1|Cox doesn't just plot an obvious decline: things do get grim, but he makes you care as you also despair for punk's cracked casualties.
23333|0|It's good for a silly laugh, this stuff. And maybe this movie will draw renewed attention to Carpenter's eminently better movie.
13180|1|Strong performances abound in the film.
79088|0|Viewers are asked so often to suspend belief that were it not for Holm's performance, the film would be a total washout.
6479|1|Basically rubbish with star power and a very funny Bobcat Goldthwait.
31013|1|Has the Depression ever been this much fun?
73675|1|Seeing is believing, and the clever Maddin understands a dimension of his medium that many of his contemporaries won't dare approach: with the right compelling images, anything is possible.
18264|1|Unlike recent Bonds, whose kills had no more weight than the one-liners that generally accompanied them, Craig's tend to be intimate, bloody, and devoid of glamour.
28540|1|"Schrader has made his reputation revealing the scarred psyches of American men.... In ""Affliction"" he creates his most poignant and powerful work."
28261|1|Branagh's noir homage is a truly great thriller. One of 1991's best.
51270|0|Ward, I'm worried about the Beaver's new movie.
15687|0|Tries too hard to make the audience cry; practically each 'emotional' moment is highlighted by the soft musical sounds of a harp and wind section.
30451|1|The Natural is an impeccably made, but quite strange, fable about success and failure in America.
60534|1|Sidney Poitier stars in an excellent performance.
7867|1|The kids will love the candy-box sets and costumes like confectionery-shop windows, the whimsy and farcical grotesqueness of it all.
19701|1|One of the best horse movies; Rooney, Taylor are fine
66387|0|An ideological intervention from the Disney machine: the Cold War re-heated for the kiddies.
6355|0|Duh-m Sandler, typical fare for him
74440|1|It's a powerful, visceral revenge flick, and Kevin Bacon does a fine acting job bringing the vigilante to life.
79219|1|Devilishly funny.
80654|1|A movie that manages to be atmospherically rich while also satisfying the slash-crash imperatives of the police-action genre.
66291|0|Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem is literally shrouded in darkness, and the only explicable reason for this pitch-black visual schema is that the filmmakers understood it was better if no one could see the **** they were shooting.
77108|1|A real button-pusher with a dynamite ending. Gene Davis is memorable as the sicko villain.
13937|0|Has no real taste of its own, but, in its mildness and predictability, offers the reassurance of a fast-food or motel chain.
1673|1|Bulworth is Warren Beatty's most passionate work since Reds -- provocative, vulgar, heartfelt and pretty darn funny.
37951|0|Like some deformed offspring that's been walled up in an attic for 20 years, this resurrects the spirit of Police Academy.

5298|1|Caine's performance, so fervent, so agonisingly dedicated, actually gains in force and touching sincerity with the years.

16273|1|The fact that [it] isn't very funny and, like its 80-year-old heroic, long outlives its necessary life, is less important than the fact that the characters frequently react gently or like credible human beings to the script's impossible notions.
61361|1|Really a fairly amazing achievement: an engrossing, witty cultural document that doesn't feel staid in the least. All this, plus spear fights.

28987|1|Contrary to popular opinion, the best moment in the film isn't when Jimmy Cagney shoves a grapefruit in his girlfriend's face.
69974|1|Many of the images in Fateless are familiar, but they're presented so unsparingly, so uncloaked by emotion, they become freshly potent.
68581|1|The characters are comical and dynamic -- especially Jimmy, Carl and Sheen -- and the outer space scenes are no less than stellar.
4053|1|Not since Rocky Horror has the film world produced such a vibrant farce of teen angst, violence, and sexual deviance.
28902|1|Although this comedy has been getting more praise than it deserves, it is nevertheless a solid, funny comedy.

73435|1|The enchanting performance by Parminder Nagra gives the movie a ton of heart and soul.

22753|1|Anderson's and Mo'Nique's talents make Two Can Play That Game just amusing and light enough to be worth the trouble despite its often trite familiarity.
3329|0|This is one of those unnecessary remakes that Hollywood regurgitates about once a month whether anybody is interested in them or not.

68195|1|Margaret doesn't throw punches, just rolls with them. Some of her actions can't be objectively condoned. But through a maternal prism, Tilda Swinton makes sure they're understood, with skill sly enough to register strongly in the most ordinary of roles.

48831|1|It's a one-gag movie, but while some of the iterations of that gag are about as hilarious as a squirt in the face from a plastic flower, a few are genuinely rib-tickling.
61430|1|A pleasant, small comedy that will have you smiling.
60503|0|A good fit for its audience.

22036|1|While not nearly on par with the original, the remake's a fast-paced and happily gore-soaked little treat.
1370|1|Subtle and wittty in discussing sexual politics in the academic world, Denis Arcand's film deservedly won the Oscar for Foreign Film in 1986.
4592|1|Though it's paced as a thriller, the film ultimately emerges as a haunting exploration of how grief can weigh on us, and the depths to which it can drive us.
4879|1|Fabulously entertaining.
28070|1|The one-sided, formulaic storyline and laughable courtroom histrionics are eclipsed by peripheral material involving Theron's brooding teenage son and penitent father.

53098|0|The boys themselves are exuberant and uninhibited in their own genial way. They just become awfully redundant and -- dare I say it? -- dull.
40527|1|The story behind this deeply explicit drama often falls short -- in fact, it's arguable if there even is a story -- but the quality of its words keeps it fresh and compelling.

33125|1|One of the smash hits of its year, this action-packed war movie is violent and amoral, and fans would say all the better for it.
25707|0|Oh, the mediocrity.
51287|0|Everyone associated with this piece of trash should be ashamed.

58194|1|Ambitiously probing every anxiety-ridden corner of the suburban mum-and-dad experience, some of its interconnecting story strands work better than others.
28726|1|A harrowing and sobering tale of self-discovery in a civilization on the verge of collapse.
44865|1|It was a pleasant surprise.
80132|1|An example of how star power can compensate plot, this is the least electric of the Bogart-Bacall pairings; luckily, there's Agnes Moorehead, the screen's best hornet, to intervene whenever the going gets too lackadasical.
49745|0|Logan's movie is a flop on many levels, a musical in which America's most macho actors, Clint Eastwood and Lee Marvin, are miscast and required to sing.
30696|0|It takes guts to remake what many believe to be Hitchcock's first masterpiece, but what Ondaatje's done with The Lodger could not be mistaken for ambition.

11803|1|It's bleak, creepy, and occasionally terrifying.
80227|1|[A] hip-swivelin' classic.
56436|1|A shocking expose about the American military's use of torture to get confessions--not always truthful ones--from prisoners suspected of terrorism. This is the kind of film that can make a difference!
50135|0|A poor imitation of The Big Chill--lesbian style--poorly executed and schematically written.
9201|0|Westfeldt and Juergensen's wordy script tries for both mainstream and offbeat, but gets lost in between.
12335|0|Even crude techniques, when properly employed, can be effective, in a lowest-common-denominator kind of way.
5020|0|A pseudo-spiritual rock video for the symbolically challenged.
7393|0|Never had I thought like cutting up a video tape
8347|1|A masterwork of burning social conscience and hard-eyed psychological realism.
77622|1|Even Penn's more indulgent flourishes seem to enhance the film's keen feeling.
12103|0|Behind Enemy Lines crosses into the ugly side of patriotism.
67227|0|Ends up as listless and bloated as one of its dead alien visitors.

13836|0|"Watching ""Loaded Weapon 1"" is like playing Trivial Pursuit with experts. It's exhausting."
68149|1|The anxiousness to be provocative weighs too heavily. That said, Crash has the big ambitions we should get every week.
2926|1|I love a good story, too, but I prefer one that actually goes somewhere (although, as joy rides to nowhere are concerned, this one is a beaut).
20461|1|A sunny view of artistic self-awareness slicing past gaiety
76291|1|As an entryway into new ways of thinking about the self, the universe, and the vast infinite whatnot of whatever (you know what we mean, oh wise one), this little movie is big.
72925|1|A spare [but witty] rumination on the interconnectedness of independent life and dependent family -- how we all need a place to drop anchor and exhale.
50502|0|If this is an example of the type of project that Robert Redford's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to, then perhaps it's time to rethink independent films.
54778|1|Forman somehow manages to craft comedy that neither veers from the challenges of realism nor reeks of shameless manipulation.

9055|0|Moore doesn't realize that she's supposed to be making a dark comedy; instead, she seems to be auditioning for the role of Mrs. Cleaver.
22631|1|Despite a few adjustments, Ripoll's film largely remains faithful to the central plotting of Lee's original film, which presented a slightly familiar yet utterly charming tale of food and families.
14610|1|"""If a man don't go his own way, he's nothin,"" says Montgomery Clift in the superbly realized melodrama, set at the oubtbreak of WWII, a motto that also sums up director Fred Zinnemann's belief system."

39982|1|Part mystery, part moral dilemma, but all seductively intriguing.
63821|1|This charming film (editing tricks aside), is rich in humor and period detail, and amazingly suspenseful considering we already know the outcome.
37012|1|Steve Martin's winning performance and his brilliant screenplay make up most of Roxanne's success, but Fred Schepisi's direction completes it.
41794|1|What really makes this movie so special, apart from the revelation that Adam Sandler can act, is the direction.
3209|1|Despite compromises imposed upon German director Wim Wenders (in his American debut), it's still worth seeing this stylish film due to Forrest's performance in the lead.
26618|1|Definitely worth a look.

42013|1|Flawed but dazzling masterpiece with a stunning performance by Roy Scheider.
26343|1|Brand may not be as satisfying as The Heart of the World or Dracula: Pages From a Virgin's Diary, but it's the first to suggest a dead-serious Maddin film may not be a bad thing.

31880|0|[Hackford] seems stuck in a private limbo, unable to decide whether he's making a special-effects flick or a pop-philosophical tract.
38223|0|The new movie, which is about how the scruffy pair save the world (or something), sends them to heaven and hell and everywhere in between. The sets are impressive, but the joke has worn perilously thin.
35212|0|A self-indulgent addition to American cinema's post-9/11 cinema, Reign Over Me sees Sandler over-reaching himself in a straight-faced role.
62261|1|A disarmingly moving film about love, relationships and secret lives.
2689|1|It's nice to see a Disney film that follows the rules of the family-film genre as Walt laid them down.

69169|1|Sexy, scary and super cool.
63972|0|This movie has such a naked desire to evoke the human condition, you want to throw a blanket over it.
9259|0|If you find [Arquette] a bit much in his AT&T commercials, be prepared for 90 minutes of his over-the-top mugging.
27628|1|DePalma, a director who chooses his projects carefully, has scored again.

42033|1|Though it's not the best installment of the series, with many, many present flaws, it sure is a very entertaining film...
30388|0|Just a strident celebration of booger jokes.
30309|1|The best movie ever written by a teenager -- Landis was 19 when he penned the first draft - and a constant comic delight.

14280|1|Formulaic fun, helped by two winning leads.

1759|1|You won't know whether to roll your eyes or smile like a fool, but you will know you've been entertained.
1111|1|The tones shift rampantly, which for some viewers can be disorienting and off-putting. But, if you're in tune with Demme's aesthetic, which usually runs counter to our cinematic intuition, it is a wild ride indeed.
11915|1|Pierre Salvadori's deceptively sunny romantic comedy insinuates its point of view steadily, amidst great glamour and breeziness, only to reveal itself as a meditation on, dare we say it, capitalism.
38118|1|A hope-filled film portraying how the individual can make a difference and that humanity is capable of following its best instincts.
68039|1|... a delightful piece of filmmaking full of imaginative flights of creative delirium and accomplished with wit, verve, style, grace, and a tongue-in-cheek joy.
16527|0|For the most part, pic is about as engaging as what's found on Saturday morning TV.
14227|0|Just as Mac and Me eventually devolved into a feature-length commercial for McDonald's, Harry and the Hendersons eventually emerges as a vegetarian screed.
64895|1|Much in the film is derivative, but Erice excels in precise evocations of childhood feelings -- there is one dumbfounding moment of lyrical, joyful horror.
10943|1|After an ebullient and inventive first half, the film loses its wind and only gets it back for a sprint or two.
12137|0|To recreate the gossipy Manhattan arena that Capote navigated with such ease and documented with such malice, you need dialogue that rings like scatter-shot and the film's script, written by its director Douglas McGrath, doesn't have it.
1304|1|A brisk, handsomely designed film in which its hardware, sturdy as it is, never overwhelms its humanity.
69407|0|It doesn't get any more painful than this dull flick.
159|1|...Cagney's picture through and through. He imbues every scene with the kind of electricity only a handful of screen stars have ever managed.
5726|1|Meticulously made with graceful style, Terence Davies' adaptation of Wharton is superior to Scorsese's Age of Innocence, the author's other famous novel.
53089|1|Some of 007's earlier adventures fail to hold up, but in a post-'Taken' world, 'Licence to Kill' certainly aged well and is a under-appreciated gem in the Bond catalog.
5471|0|Just about as bad as it sounds.
74268|0|An amiable, if flyweight, diversion.
48115|1|Quirky, enjoyable comedy with an unknown Parker Posey on roller skates and Adam Sandler being charming in a real minor part.
64693|1|Elf may be no more than a pleasant, amusing trifle, a grin that fades well before Thanksgiving, but it also will endure in the way that all decent Hollywood-made Christmas fairy tales last, if they're rendered with good cheer and goodwill.
32622|0|The most dour, sexless piece of escapism in memory.
19066|1|Chris Carter had the daunting task of pleasing fans of the show, while at the same time not alienating those new to it. It's a balancing act that he mostly achieved, but in the end it's probably best enjoyed by those who are already fans.
14437|1|A wily, performance-driven heist-gone-wrong picture with shrewd underworld savvy reminiscent of Snatch without the smug self-awareness.
29709|1|This is a zanily inventive piece of work, with delightful special effects, which set the style for a long series of live-action Disney films.
32002|1|A definite parochial fascination is liberally assured all the way and the seams in a none-too-good whodunnit are rather cleverly concealed.
30549|1|"It's not a bad story as far as it goes, and says a lot about the strange culture war journalism ... [but] no story, no matter how interesting, can't do without a little bit of the Hollywood treatment, and ""The Hunting Party"" suffers that in spades."
26883|1|Like a family reunion with its share of embarrassing moments, it may be worth attending all the same.
26301|1|A marginally diverting, fun way to spend a couple of hours, and you even get to hear De Niro and Crystal duet on tunes from 'West Side Story.'

10900|0|"After just 30 minutes of ""Whipped,"" you either want to hose down the screen with Lysol or dip yourself in bleach. It's that offensive, that rotten, and it easily stands as the worst film in years."
47472|1|There are some gaps in the movie's reality, and some O. Henry-like contrivances, but the masterful trick Boy A plays on viewers is to get them to care before giving them reasons not to.

75640|0|The story never amounts to much more than a rather tepid Chinese rendition of The Women.

29400|0|Like cinematic Olestra, it'll slide right through your brain leaving no impression.
60113|1|Full of wonderful comedic business, throw-away lines and some effortless ensemble set pieces, The Front Page bristles with its collection of talents on both sides of the camera.... It's that Billy Wilder touch of hurtful grains of truth inside every com
71667|1|Film is visually and physically stunning but its three tales of the supernatural are more intellectual than visceral.
28926|1|Good Night is not your average historical recreation. It doesn't dumb-down its story or its characters with needless explanation for the benefit of an under-educated audience.
20520|0|The more dimensions [Wright] adds to her character, the more silly and shallow the others seem to become.
5038|0|Painful to sit through.
14152|0|Know what this sounds like? It sounds like a screenplay.
20030|1|It's a convoluted, rich plot that goes back decades, but The Departed is so sure-footed it all makes sense.
75022|1|Excellent performances, combined with deft direction make this one to watch.
50898|0|There are many instances when the film is too obvious in its attempts at humor.
8153|1|Caroline Link's Oscar winning film has sweeping theme music, stunning cinematography and a well-told story that offers a unique slice of history.
8253|1|The Mist paints [its] divides starkly -- perhaps a bit too much so -- but combined with its spooks and gore, it makes for effective, smart entertainment.
60496|1|Produced by Zanuck, this WWII epic is the joint effort of 3 directors, no less than 5 writers, and numerous stars, including John Wayne.
8178|1|A credible piece of pop entertainment of the hottie-in-distress genre.
7265|0|This is an incredible story badly told.
47182|0|One long, tedious rumination on the blurring distinction between man and machines.
12912|1|The talky debate over scientific morality is simplistic to say the least, but there is a sneaky undercurrent of social satire and a retro glory to the animation...
37927|1|Maybe the most wonderfully British movie ever made.
18275|1|There's nothing very suspenseful going on ... but the cast and the story will appeal to both kids and adults.
54187|1|Director Peter Weir has created a strikingly subversive piece of information-age paranoia as visionary as anything Hollywood might manufacture this summer, or this decade.
80896|0|Saying that the newest Saw movie is better than the last one is a bit like saying that your latest root canal was better than your last one.
8747|0|Whoopi's a cool lady, but she's done a lot of stunningly awful movies. This is (easily) one of the worst.
17263|1|There's camp to spare -- check out the doc's house band -- but there's also plenty of innovation on display, to say nothing of ample amounts of effective humor.
72455|1|Spike Lee's furiously melancholy drama about life and dread in post-9/11 New York City.
18740|0|Wilson is inert and lethargic... Instead of adding some comic energy and vitality to the proceedings, he seems to be sleepwalking through them.
2741|0|Hatefully stupid and unfunny.
58479|1|The movie is a riot of tropical turquoise, magenta and pink, spiced with marigold, red and green. You'd swear it was drenched in a tangy tamarind sauce
7852|1|There isn't really a big laugh in the bunch, but the comedy does manage to keep its balance, barely, thanks to an efficient pace and light disposition.
19198|1|A skillful blend of history and fiction in which the Nordic star, looking as alluring as ever, gives a performance which merits nothing but the highest praise. She appears every inch a queen.
1522|0|The cars get to have all the fun, and they don't have nearly enough of it.
75442|1|Fincher is such a technically brilliant director that he can elevate a genre film--a suspenser about a damsel-in-distress--above its melodramatic trappings. The confined space (whole movie is set within a house) is no big challenge for him.
6162|0|It probably seemed like a good idea at the time.
54228|0|Doubtless The Evil Dead was meant to be a sort of spoof. But in every genre by now there are too many dud movies claiming spoof status.
1463|0|Seems calculated to deliberately offend not only every character onscreen but everyone in the audience as well.
69468|1|What a joy. Just a fun good-hearted film. I giggled nearly the whole time.
85|1|Amy Adams and Emily Blunt, two fine actresses, get the opportunity to glow in strong lead roles as complex, emotionally fractured females who work hard to earn your respect -- and reclaim their own.
58683|1|...trods off the established path of Frankenstein tropes and eschews routine horrifics by putting a lens on its people rather than on an expected cereal-box monster.
18680|0|Lame, hokey, filled with plot holes, and cursed with a lazy script.
77079|1|a realistic (for Hollywood) thriller that proceeds at a breakneck pace...Kim Basinger and Chris Evans do terrific jobs.
25260|1|We are talking humor here in a shade of black that a raven would envy.
4107|0|...even at a running time of only 91-minutes, the film often feels substantially longer.
14086|1|Catching a look at what took a gorgeous kid, full of life, into a rare freak show is certainly worth a look.
11861|1|Director Ryan Little has mounted a remarkably effective production on what must have been a shoestring by Hollywood standards.
13324|0|Date Movie still labours under the mistaken impression that exaggerated mimicry alone is enough to entertain.
6475|1|Newman gives a brilliant performance in this powerful David and Goliath tale of a sad man's quest for redemption in the face of despair. Newman, director Lumet and the film itself all should have won an Academy Award, but sadly didn't.
82051|1|The temporal experience of watching Six Degrees of Separation is one of absorption and intrigue.
47629|1|Twohy lets his story's central guessing game play out with patient tautness.
52606|0|Flashes of color and streaks of movement can make for a striking picture, but only if you can see what's taking place, not to mention if you care about who is in jeopardy.
4351|0|The movie also introduces the concept of time-traveling fetuses, yet we're never treated to this in any visual way.
47780|0|Competently acted, theatrically staged.
57321|1|Clearly a companion piece to (and just as good as, if not better than) 2005's fantastic A History of Violence, Eastern Promises is all about blood, in the familial as well as the literal sense.
25395|0|Muddled liberal Zionist politics. Even worse as a film.
5765|1|A high-spirited Renaissance romance starring the thoroughly modern Drew Barrymore.
60607|1|You can pretty much tell which parts were written by Seth Rogen. That was probably why 50% of the movie was actually funny.
45789|1|It's hard to sum up Sweetie, which happens to be one of the movie's strengths.
11973|1|We are supposed to like all the characters, and yet in some way, we can't like any of them.
67780|0|As Kline begins to take his presidential duties seriously, the comedy seeps out, a listless civic-mindedness drifts in like fog off the Potomac.
36398|0|The central section devoted to training in Egypt sags badly through its crass buddy antics and its crude caricatures of wogs and pommies.
18038|0|Neither the film's smug white bigots nor its uniformly noble blacks are well served by such oversimplification.
36847|1|It doesn't enhance the experience, because the film's timeless appeal is down to great characters and wonderful storytelling; a classic that doesn't need goggles or gimmicks.
20244|1|...an inspiring and ennobling character study in which love and respect trump pure success.
29970|0|Banal and lifeless.
26323|0|Midler's character is empty, boring, selfish.
14634|0|A film about the type of women's liberation that I despise.
3621|1|Fun... but unbelievable. Good for a sunday in pijama.

76780|1|Alfred Hitchcock brings John Buchan's novel to the screen with characteristic wit and verve.
75431|1|The movie could have toppled easily without a strong lead actor, and fortunately, Vincent's inner turmoil is entirely convincing, thanks to Recoing's subtle turn.
48229|0|William Maher's melodrama is much too grim and bleak for even the most cynical viewer to enjoy...
69028|0|Ed Harris as the fall guy is good and the visuals of this film noir are impressive nut the narrative is severely flawed.
11694|0|Sappy and manipulative; it's further weighed down by an overloaded, over-politically-correct script.

62651|0|Presumably patterned after Robert Rodriguez's Sin City, but substantially more graphic, there is surely an audience for this empty brutality, but you would not want to know anyone to whom this picture appeals.
28290|1|A masterpiece about a reluctant warrior
67597|1|Where the usual noir takes place in a nightmare world, this one seems to inhabit a dream: there's no longer fear in the images, but rather a distanced, idealized beauty.
65674|0|A horribly failed satire that should be avoided by all.
17935|1|A comedy classic that only misses out on the Python canon's top spot because the talented swines also made Life Of Brian.
6526|1|The most interesting thing about the film -- apart from two smashing performances from Vilhj√°lmsdottir and Egilsd√≥ttir -- is the glimpse it provides into 1950s Iceland.
58599|1|One of Fuller's few studio-financed pictures, this bruising, brutal movie still manages to emanate waves of B-movie street cred at every juncture.
38438|0|So muddled and frustrating in its storytelling that I felt like giving up on the film halfway through.
23905|1|Handsomely, seductively drawn, Lady and the Tramp owns its place in the canon...
70046|0|A movie that blandly goes where too many Star Trek pictures have gone before.
2992|1|Allows Ray Harryhausen to showcase some superb stop-motion animation effects and the great Bernard Herrmann (Citizen Kane, Psycho, The 7th Voyage of Sinbad) to add another smashing score to his resume.

49061|0|This rendition is hardly a freshman course.
45692|0|So what's all the fuss about? If people want to staple paper to their inner thighs, let them. The question is whether you're prepared to pay to watch them do it.
3941|1|Middling Disney a la Dean Jones and Peter Ustinov; OK family fare.
63928|0|A 30-minute idea wrapped in a 100-minute movie. It's a jewel box filled with cubic zirconia.

6424|1|Prison flick from ex-con screenwriter is raw and realistic, with powerful acting.
67865|0|...a trilogy of sporadically chilling yet ultimately ineffective horror tales...
17801|0|This is good stuff. Unfortunately, director Herb Gardner is a little too fond of writer Herb Gardner's script, which just keeps going and going and going -- until even two old pros such as Walter and Ossie have worn out their welcome.
24131|0|If the 20 minutes of deleted scenes on the DVD had been inserted back into the actual film, Supernova would have been much better.
56564|1|Somewhat preachy, but perfect blend of Williams' comedy and drama.
37979|0|How the Grinch Stole Christmas is thick with irony but doesn't have the guts to explore any of it.

16343|0|...the virtual nadir of the Disney oeuvre.
11242|1|...not quite up to the originality of the first film, but its sheer exuberance is good enough to keep youngsters enthralled and most adults at least mildly entertained.

37662|0|The movie's flat-footed nature means it's unlikely to put a spring in the step of anyone over the age of 10.
54623|1|Dr. Strangelove does what so few comedies do today: it challenges us, provokes us, unsettles us while also making us laugh.
5616|0|Flabby, dull and overlong, it's a B-grade movie with A-list talent and an inflated idea of its own importance. Think Tsotsi crossed with Clockers with the imagination of neither.
8316|0|Stereotyped Latino sitcom about a cheating man.

63514|1|Desperately funny.
3252|1|Together is a drama of exceptional, elegant beauty... it's the kind of movie that makes you smile, that breaks your heart, that keeps you watching for more.
69491|1|For writer/director Paul Brickman, this was a case of being in the right place at the right time and, perhaps most importantly, getting the right leading man in place.
6098|1|Its combination of romance and adventure (and a bit of comedy) was spot-on, and few films that have arrived since have captured Stone's enthusiasm and good-naturedness
15718|1|Maybe the art house isn't a place for perverts anymore. Indeed, the privacy of one's own laptop seems a somewhat safer setting for Zizek's kinky act of criticism.
9243|0|I actually walked out of this one...bad!
46251|0|A preposterously transparent attempt to market hip-hop in as anodyne a way as possible, but -- for its target audience of pre-teenage girls -- it works.
53958|0|It's difficult to sustain a responsible subtext when you're delivering the jolts required to keep butts in the seats.
12537|0|Orky isn't shown until near the end, and then only briefly. At first, I thought this was an attempt to build suspense, but after a while, I began to suspect that the high cost of sea-monster footage was the real explanation.
3100|1|'This night is about the American dream,' Kumar promises, and you know what? It sort of is. [Blu-Ray]
4396|1|Expertly acted throughout, this remains a definitive snapshot of British life in the 1980s.

25351|0|God forbid Arnold should have to shell out for one of those Spanish-speaking turbomen being hocked in the bad part of town.
18558|1|The striking beauties of the Canadian Rockies co-star with the blonde charms of Marilyn Monroe and the masculine muscles of Robert Mitchum in River of No Return.
71467|0|Fails to come up with worthy gags and one-liners for the able cast.
12265|1|Fast, Cheap & Out of Control convinced me that a documentary can be a poem.
67843|0|"A basic rip-off of ""Ferris Bueller""..."
36719|1|The sex scenes are so bizarre as to be parodic and it all looks terribly ugly. But wonderful vignettes of rural life, and a terrific performance from Pablito the piglet. Ham indeed.
40825|0|This thing was a dud in the 80s. That's saying something.
72473|0|While it's fascinating to get Castro's perspective on things like the Bay of Pigs invasion, the missile crisis, US intervention in Latin America and the Cold War, we can't help but feel that Stone is bending this documentary for his own personal interest.
69849|0|Film lovers beware! The evil spirits of boredom will befall should you enter a darkened cinema and endure Darkness Falls.
45127|0|Best characterized as an honourable folly.

10064|0|"""the initial sparkle has all but faded"""
17525|0|This is by no means a terrible movie, but I think we can all be thankful that Howard got this out of his system early on.
61297|0|tries to do too much and fails
13135|1|Though somewhat repetitive and clunky, Chris Bell's Bigger Stronger Faster deserves credit for presenting a fairly evenhanded examination of steroids & their threat to the integrity of the country's sports industry.
80298|1|An intense, sometimes sickening, documentary about the abortion issue in the United States which reeks of brimstone.
19376|1|Before Tony Hawk, skateboarding had the Z-Boys.
44271|0|Predecessors The Mummy and The Mummy Returns stand as intellectual masterpieces next to The Scorpion King.
70820|0|A one-dimensional bad news comedy.
60886|1|A film of infinite possibility that somehow got reduced to tangible mediocrity.
11932|1|An engrossing, full-of-surprises thriller about a woman who gives new meaning to the term 'supermom.'
64562|1|[Burton's] vision of the ominous woods, the shadowy town, and its pale inhabitants give the film texture and bring it to life.
13245|0|This long-overdue follow-up goes the way of most sequels, delivering a visually impressive but far more simplistic -- and thus unsatisfying -- story.
38879|1|Spun is mostly played for laughs, as evidenced by the broad style employed by the various actors.
26818|1|A more honest and better made movie than any of the other group of films made about black neighborhoods in the early 90's.
6089|0|Nadia is nowhere to be seen and Stifler never surrenders the spotlight in what is the weakest link of the American Pie series.
6139|0|It is probably asking too much of this phantasmagoria that it make sense.
42873|1|Ripe with homoerotic undercurrents -- which O'Toole mines with relish in his great hysterical performance, full of cunning, eloquence and mad outbursts.
73275|1|The actors are simply too good, and the story too intriguing, for technical flaws to get in the way.
46920|1|Sadly cashes in on the original.
62041|0|This is not one of those occasions when you feel like giving Zucker an even break.
4921|0|The elements never quite come together, and the main characters never quite spring to life.
490|1|Mildly engaging melodrama that's more sharply written than directed.
15278|1|Engaging and beguiling - perhaps in spite of itself - and a vital part of film history.
73035|1|A fleecy romantic caper with a dusting of feminism, the picture is basically a one-joke movie successfully nursed by director Ivan Reitman.
15217|1|Absolutely superb.
77821|0|Then there's Mac himself, a puppet which couldn't possibly look more like a puppet (a bad, shoddy puppet at that).
3319|0|In Twin Peaks the movie, all the twists get straightened out. The thrill is gone.
27613|1|An intricate, rather beautiful dance of momentum and force.
28804|0|Its final scenes are so slapdash and rambling that one wonders whether the young actors have assumed writing and directing duties as well.
42494|1|The Wackness, while no masterpiece, is the kind of film that doesn't come to much but is watchable as it saunters along with a provoking sense of meaningful pessimism. The performances are really the thing - Levine hasn't managed anything better.
16966|0|It's the perfect cinematic vehicle -- or at least it would have been, if Radford's adaptation weren't so unremittingly cloddish.
47259|1|At last a horror film with real bite.
28557|1|The kitsch on-air shopping sequences are often very funny.
5601|0|It's hard to escape the conclusion that all the originality and excitement have been drained from the series.
4053|1|It's solid Miyazaki, although he has reached greater heights both before and since.
15143|1|Enjoyable, intelligently constructed and technically remarkable.
8745|0|The intolerable apotheosis of 80s youth-driven filmmaking.
41155|1|It makes a rare departure from the ordinary run of horror films and emerges as an oddly touching study of the working of a sensitive child's mind.
44915|1|Sigourney Weaver is magnificent in Imaginary Heroes ...
45071|1|Gets a lot of mileage out of the well-worn trapped-in-a-blank-full-of-hostages action genre.
39981|0|More aptly titled The Big Miss, this grade-Z action parody looks like a second-rate John Woo cast-off ... and feels like something out of Lloyd Kaufman's Big Bag o' Troma Rejects.
40159|1|Not for the weak of heart, one of the best Lynchian outings with some fantastically memorable dialogue.
19200|1|Adheres to the historical facts of Dillinger's well-documented tapestry of brazen daylight heists, gritty shootouts and improbable jailbreaks.
13732|1|An adequate if slightly overlong history of the sport, Descent adheres to the same storytelling trajectory as documentary predecessors on surfing and skateboarding.
7234|1|More shocking than hilarious, this spoof of the teensploit genre offers just enough funny moments to earn this critic's seal of approval.
34971|1|A lot of meanings float around in this outwardly simple fable.
59970|0|The stagnant midsection does the hopelessly tedious atmosphere no favors...
12649|0|The film's points are made obvious the first minute and then monotonously drilled ad nauseum the remaining 87.
56187|1|"A portrait of the homeless community of ""mole people"" who lived in sections of disused underground tunnels in New York, this is a singularly powerful account of the lives of the dispossessed and desperate."
14302|1|This film, minus the deft and artistic handling of the director, Alfred Hitchcock, despite its cast and photography, would not stand up for Grade A candidacy.
44815|0|In the end, I can't think of a movie that matters less than Just My Luck. It's just negligible.
4755|0|Here on Earth does what it can to flatten the ascending careers of its attractive leads, yet Chris Klein and Leelee Sobieski probably will live to see another big-screen day.
24587|1|Innovative movie with a mature premise.
12240|1|If the narration gets a little hokey at times -- clich√©d phrases are tossed out without much thought -- the interview subjects are refreshingly real, and you can't help but smile at their waterlogged wisdom.
17629|0|...couldn't get a laugh from a hyena.
68132|0|The range of its satire and comedy, as displayed in 22 segments running from a minute or two up to 30 minutes, is fairly narrow.
37089|1|Very much a film of this era, its director returning after a ten-year absence from the cinema with a peculiar little masterpiece about things unrecoverable in time.
16677|1|Some modern lightweight films could learn a cinematic lesson from directors Irving Pichel and Ernest Schoedshack's sixty-three-minute running time

7286|1|Perfectly enjoyable but perfectly forgettable.
78265|1|This wholly enjoyable entertainment sees Soderbergh setting himself a new challenge - the hi-tech robbery procedural - and relishing the clich√©s even as he freshens them with a dab of polish, wit, pace and a light touch of irony.
18803|1|Effective.
50678|0|The ad campaign for Saw V assures the viewer, 'You won't believe how it ends.' This is true, because you won't believe it could possibly be this lame.
556|1|This series should be sealed in a time capsule. It is on my list of the 10 greatest films of all time, and is a noble use of the medium.
55122|0|Brody has offbeat charisma, but it's no match for the corny dialogue he's given here, not to mention the Wild at Heart snakeskin jacket he wears.
58090|0|It's hard to get laughs out of stuff that devolved into parody 10 or 20 years ago.
49224|0|The material is consistently clever and funny, though ultimately the attitudes are too narrow to nourish a feature-length film.
39190|0|A work-retreat sequence is hilarious, thanks to a scene-stealing supporting bit from Jason Bateman. And Reilly's convincing portrayal of the somewhat self-destructive Richard does make the whole thing watchable.
11881|1|As horror flicks go this is both smart and suspenseful.
36057|1|The simplicity of The Way Home has few equals this side of Aesop
21971|1|Back, baby, back. An excellent police procedural and a personal triumph for Ben Affleck, steering his younger brother to a performance that deserved louder applause from gong juries.
62564|0|To appreciate or even tolerate the film, you must separate yourself from the characters and the material. What's unfortunate is that the movie is too well made to let you do just that.
62647|1|absolutely wonderful!
19803|1|Aside from all this surface nonsense, there's something interesting about the film (perhaps all the emphasis on eating and mouths).
21506|1|Along with The Man Who Would Be King and The Dead, this is arguably John Huston's best literary adaptation, and conceivably his very best film.
4989|0|...[the script] tries way too hard to come off as clever and hip.
4525|1|It's a by-the-numbers Hollywood movie, but a surprisingly competent one.
25224|0|The underlining homoerotic subtext gets muddy, then washed away, in the creek.
74036|0|This is the male equivalent of the chick flick. It could have been titled Divine Secrets of the Da-Da Brotherhood.
76210|1|Lavish, interesting, evocative but strained and self-conscious, Cotton Club is all watchable curiosity.
79674|1|A fine family film filled with rich lessons about animal and human interaction.
19281|1|Bring a date too, after this you might look at each other in a whole new light.
78680|0|Considering Bond gets disguised as an ape, a crocodile and a clown, the film has a lot more to be embarrassed about than its title.
4992|1|So there's this new documentary about crossword puzzles . . . WAIT, get back here!
15289|0|There are some cute visuals now and then, but overall Good Burger may raise your blood pressure and, if you suffer through the entire 94 minutes, perhaps even lower your IQ.
52502|0|Center Stage is the same old stuff, not an arabesque more.
2782|1|The Bridge on the River Kwai is David Lean's last film not to succumb to bloat.
52776|1|Even by their high standards, the performances of Weaver and Kingsley here are impressive, and Polanski ratchetts up the tension nicely. A chilling and thought-provoking piece.
33803|0|... meanders and never delivers the pay-off it promises.
50897|1|It doesn't break anything, but it doesn't have to. I smiled a lot, sometimes had misty eyes and never lost interest.
19415|0|The whole extravaganza could have made for a plucky 70 minutes, but it packs on an additional three-quarters of an hour of saw-toothed melodrama.
1657|1|Some caper movies build suspense, while others tweak the genre with tongue lancing cheek. But this lesbian caper pic often pulls off both feats in the same scene, even simultaneously.
19471|0|What the audience ends up with is a watered down whitewash of Kallen's life story.
6440|0|No Brains Involved
5234|1|Lumet channels Pacino's relentless energy into a sustained and blackly comic study of hopeless desperation.
48991|0|The story is as compelling as watching the ink dry on a superfluous UN treaty.
34401|0|Doesn't really cut it in the Western genre.
785|0|Mostly a hodgepodge of stale show-biz stereotypes mixed with the brand of schmaltzy emotionalism that can be bought off the rack of any store on Rodeo Drive.
73569|0|Even fans of the series may be disappointed.
81846|1|Anne of the Thousand Days is a stunning-acted, sumptuous, grand-scale widescreen drama of the royal bed chamber and political intrigues that created the Church of England.

13871|1|A better than average space vampire flick.
17903|0|The longer you stay with it, the more routine and uninspired it seems -- not to mention cowardly.
45379|1|Nausica√§, princess of the Valley of the Wind, is a screen heroine--or, rather, hero--for the ages.
32574|0|...would have been better served by characters with a little less formula than the paint-by-numbers projects so loved by these women of Wellesley College.
18184|1|Howards End provides more than enough in the way of production values-impeccable set decoration, elaborate costumes, beautiful locations and exquisite cinematography-to keep its primary audience entertained.
48196|0|Jason before hockey mask, but with a nifty flour sack on his head
2703|1|Judd shines like the movie star she was destined to become.
73657|1|as a thinly disguised allegory for the fading career of Sylvester Stallone, it is a perversely enjoyable ride filled with retro pleasures and immense camp potential.
10613|1|Though made in the late 50s, Hiroshima's imagery and music give it a feel at once modern and timeless, this is a beautiful piece of work.

61676|1|Good thing the people serving this utilitarian story have the wit to dress it up a little and make it dance.
20238|0|You can have a better time title-scanning Johnny pics in an alphabetical video guide than you can enduring the latest Blade Runner knockoff: Johnny Mnemonic.
23077|0|Although terrible, this film does raise ... interesting questions: Why does Hollywood keep ripping off THE OMEN? Why would anyone continue hiring Stephen Hopkins to direct a movie? Why would two-time Oscar-winner Hilary Swank agre to be in this mess?
38567|1|Haunted house tale not as mild as the cartoons.
79309|1|The further look at how the series just became goofier and goofier and hinted at Jason's inevitable foray in to space.
70603|1|Unusual and delightful.
2337|0|A misogynistic, dull-witted bore.

81389|0|Cinematic Sominex that feels like it was tailor-made for immediate simultaneous broadcast on the Lifetime Channel and the Oxygen Network.
8926|0|The Cleavers have come to represent the stereotype of the white-bread family.This reverent '90s remake doesn't do much to challenge it.

77882|0|Watch it with the sound off to see two pretty people and miss the dumb plot.

12492|1|Some horrible Monday, why not cut work to see it?
62219|1|Walsh keeps the film close to the ground and makes the transition between the two very different stories with complete confidence.
9682|1|Rize is full of sugar-rush adrenaline, but it also has the presence of mind to cool our enthusiasm enough to pierce through to its issues' core.
5319|1|Wonderful romantic mystery, sure to haunt your memory

39536|0|Sometimes funny but often plodding.
58998|1|Tumbleweeds is far from a slick Hollywood-style production. It's not encumbered, for one thing, by star power. There's no list of past hits, Oscar bids, parts gone wrong.

695|1|The light comedy is sweetly timed, the direction smart and assured, and the visuals bright, colourful, unobtrusive and faultless.

6583|1|Stallone, now 60, has something in common with Rocky - he's an awkwardly bulked-up dinosaur, fighting to prove that the game hasn't passed him by. On that level, he succeeds.
2138|0|One of the sleaziest movies of the year and certainly the most unpleasant.
61709|1|An interesting evocation of a decadent era marked by opulence, excess and abject poverty. But works equally well as a study of personal redemption amidst the turmoil.
7968|1|It's amazing what you'll find if you're willing to look below the surface.
23593|1|Master filmmaker Clint Eastwood continues in the classic Howard Hawks/John Ford tradition with unobtrustive direction, relaxed pacing, and strong characters and storytelling.
4076|1|Irma Vep's director, Olivier Assayas, evinces a love of the process that's nearly as palpable as Truffaut's.
11241|0|...plays out like Jerry Bruckheimer's table scraps-- going through the motions in a clueless fog of market-research statistics and demographic pandering.
6033|0|A load of pretentious crap.
27944|1|Delon's inscrutable presence adds to an unnerving atmosphere of anticipation. You feel that something bad could come crashing into the frame at any second. And you would be right.
12614|0|Timeline takes the most ridiculous movie plot ever and multiplies it by ten.
2642|1|The best of the original series, but the most intense, too.
27717|1|One of the best films I have ever seen, constantly pulling the rug from underneath us, seeing things from new sides, plunging deeper, getting more intense.
76712|1|Despite some occasionally sloppy filmmaking, I think the picture is worth a look. It raises important ideas and issues, asks important questions. No one could argue against that, right? Bueller...Bueller...Bueller...
46612|1|There are moments when the story sags, as it postures and revels in its own eloquence, but with strong performances and a moving final act, this is still a fine, thought-provoking film.
12939|1|The movie is state-of-the-art, over-the-top, non-stop Hollywood hokum. And that's meant as a compliment, too.
49266|1|We're constantly kept on our toes regarding issues of representation while Pekar's sour but indefatigible working-class skepticism carries us along.
36917|1|You can easily tell that the budget was threadbare. In fact, the catering for the crew probably consisted of tap water and peanut-and-jelly sandwiches.
32319|1|Along with some good laughs, there's also a bit of effective tension.
41744|0|It strives mightily to convince us that the Chaos Theory rules us, yet everything in it feels preordained.
74488|1|A sweet and heartwarming story even as it celebrates and justifies the entire ridiculous phenomenon that Deruddere has been spoofing all along.
4237|1|It has its slack spells, but Rafelson's sure feel for the inexpressible subtleties of emotional relationships is evident throughout.
65707|0|Not enough here that's new.
15615|0|It's only slightly more enjoyable than having army ants gnaw at your privates.
166|0|Unique atmosphere, solid performances and profound discussions about the nature of our violent, technology-obsessed society don't add up to enough by the end of the movie.
2408|1|Here's a title that lives up to its expectations; Jay Lee's schlockingly funny horror flick is filled with inventive ideas and delivers in spades for fans of the genre
53159|1|virtually every frame of the film is a love letter to a bygone era as realized in the vibrant tones of the music-video-addled '80s
36739|1|Disreputably fun... just about the best low-budget movie about killer robots destroying a shopping mall that can ever be produced.
60030|1|Deliciously disgusting.
23481|1|One of the all-time great potboilers featuring a powerhouse performance by the always underrated George Peppard.
8635|1|Ordet's faithfulness is both old fashioned and invigorating
6403|0|Perhaps a greater passage of time was needed to provide a more effective historical perspective, but Tiger has a bigger problem with a dramatic structure that sags conspicuously in the middle, never to completely correct itself.
69301|0|Lands with a resounding splat somewhere between the realm of the truly repellent and the unintentionally funny.
78105|1|A disturbing, spooky but eventually uplifting drama/satire/horror film starring Jim Carrey.
78605|1|A charming comedy reflecting the mores of the 1960s swinging London, Georgy Girl has not dated particularly well, but the acting is good, particularly Lynn Redgrave in the lead and James Mason in the supporting role.
75707|0|A beautifully designed but ponderously executed attempt to summon up the spirit of the Austrian fin-de-si√®cle painter.
71946|0|A poor fit for anyone. And that includes even the undiscriminating gorehounds looking for yet another bloody slice of payback.
42089|1|My least favorite Muppet movie. But it's still the Muppets, so it's worth a viewing.
60551|1|While sincerity obviously can't guarantee quality, it's still a refreshing step up from the blatant commercialism of most West Coast media projects.
75277|1|Pandro Berman, the producer, and Clarence Brown, the director, have made it into a conservatively exciting and engaging film whose chief virtue is its acting, especially a letter-perfect, beautifully felt performance by Mickey Rooney as the jockey.
52583|1|...Hitch asserts that men are simple-minded, oafish, accident-prone, not nearly as smart as women, and freaking adorable!
34066|1|Adding 22 minutes only enhances Leone's brilliant saga of guilt and betrayal
4674|1|This Bergman discourse on the nature of art and the artist's relation to society is shrouded in the trappings of gothic horror.
63403|0|A number of the images in Rumble Fish are more memorable than the film is as a whole, sometimes for the wrong reasons.
54039|1|Underrated film focuses on fascinating story of real car maker, played well by Jeff Bridges.
6554|1|A treat for Jean-Claude Van Damme fans, a superior action thriller loaded with jaw-dropping stunts and special effects, and strong in production values.
80960|0|Instead of presenting the story and allowing us to draw our own conclusions, Cassavetes blatantly tells us what we should think.
34128|1|One of the best and most poignant films of 2002...
36925|1|"Coming to terms with ""the other"" (whether stranger, enemy, or alien) is as critical to the development of soul now as it was in the 1950s."
79943|1|Sensation trumps cogitation-unsurprising in a Hollywood production-which doesn't negate the enduring allure of this beautiful bauble.
75881|1|A cute little trifle that delivers on the good time it promises.
35964|1|Nothing goes bang in the night. Rather there is a continuous unsettling drone screech of everything going wrong all the way through.
49752|1|Most of the film is entertaining. The cast is uniformly excellent and the resounding praise aimed at the late Heath Ledger is deserved.
6293|1|Passable service comedy featuring Rick Nelson.
56035|1|Apatow genuinely loves his hero, and the film's innate sweetness carries it through the rough patches of a funny comedy with a central relationship that isn't particularly funny.
58106|0|Fleder can only fling the camera about and indulge in some familiar screen sadism ... as he tries to squeeze a few thrills from material as desiccated as his leading man.
36623|1|Easy to forget if not for the presence of the wonderful Parker Posey.
3781|1|Jean-Jacques Annaud made an impressive directing debut with his WWI-set political tale, which won the 1976 Best Foreign Language Oscar.
19045|0|This movie ain't all that funny.
68298|1|Thanks to Walter Murch's keen, intuitive sound montage and Hackman's clammy, subtle performance, the movie captures [an] elusive and universal fear-that of losing the power to respond, emotionally and morally, to the evidence of one's own senses.
2751|1|This was Falconetti's only major film and over a period of a year under Dreyer's direction (a combination of cruelty and patience), her extraordinarily expressive face made for one of the greatest, most harrowing screen performances.
46642|1|It's all pretty swanky.
12878|1|Its aim is to raise awareness of an impending financial disaster if America continues acting fiscally and morally irresponsible.
62245|1|Edward Albee's vitriolic stage portrayal of domestic blisslessness translated grainily and effectively to the screen.
504|1|Scriptwriter Daniel Taradash rescued, if not quite a gem, then at least a high-grade industrial diamond from this rough original.
55422|1|definitely worth a better reception than it's received over the years.
17743|1|Carrey and his aggressive overbite are back, but this time he's better used as an ingredient instead of as the plot.
9342|1|So-so adventure fantasy that spawned several sequels.
19929|1|Sergio Leone's Western is his undisputed masterpiece, a lush, sensuous, elegiac operatic film made on epic yet intimate scale.
18601|1|One of the last truly great Roman epics.
13781|1|A touching little pleasure. The story is about as uncomplicated as it can get, and the visuals and the performance of Zhang Ziyi are there for the audience to simply soak-in.
77663|1|Sadness is tempered with humor, even to a 'good luck' wallet found under a policeman's nose, just as, tempered by the unknown and unforeseeable, life itself is sweet as well as bitter.
52085|1|For the actors -- and lovers of fine acting -- it makes the movie a feast.
44941|1|Worth watching for Redgrave's powerfully detailed performance as the schoolmaster.
12113|0|I don't know how it happened, or what Simon West was thinking, but the first half of Con Air is brilliant and the second half is a non-stop climax, and a dimwitted one at that.
13553|0|Attenborough's very traditional biopic is a disappointment.
37304|0|Parts of this are visually stunning, but for the most part, it's the standard new age pap.
16003|1|Weaves a simple premise into comedy gold.
7270|1|Beginning with the Rorschach-like images of the opening credits, Cronenberg invites us to intuit our own meanings from his weblike design...
5988|1|I haven't been this thrilled by a new star since I saw my first Jackie Chan movie.
12046|0|The end notes of Loser are lame, and it is not encouraging when a college movie means 'aid,' but spells it 'aide.'
31970|0|Sluggish and stiff run-of-the-mill romance comedy that clogs the heart more than it pumps anything remotely stimulating
14735|0|The Long, Hot Summer starts superbly and ends in a senseless, flabby heap.
26637|1|Could hardly be called even-handed, and it's certainly repetitive, but despite its failings it's still worth seeing--as so often, especially by those who probably won't.
53771|0|Can we really be expected to invest in a budding relationship between a woman and the best buddy of her dead lover?

12791|1|It's as good as you remember.
7947|0|The 15-year-old MTV cartoon on which it is based must be better than this.
17415|0|Characterisation is regulation thin, plotting largely nonsensical, 'camerawork' and effects increasingly pyrotechnical until an amazing final light show inside the Ark.
61176|0|Inevitably, ideas give way to special-effects
46812|1|Terrifying and tense in a Hitchcock way.
13155|1|"Takashi Miike has a style that definitely sets this one apart from the all of the American ""stalker chick"" films."
68189|1|Whether he's dead or alive, this film reveals Tupac to be a scared, skinny kid with a gun, and a vulnerable human being who could easily be pierced by bullets, just like the rest of us.
56337|1|The fourth Bond, marking the point at which spectacular hardware began to dominate the series. Sleek and quite fun all the same.

547|1|Offers a winning portrait of sassy black sister solidarity.
10570|1|"With Sixties vigor and carefree looseness, the legendary musician and poet has given us a late-career ""Purple Rain"" that turns out to be a great bad movie."
39590|0|Mira Nair's film fails as a melodrama as well as erotic fantasy; the sexul material had to be toned down due to censorship.
31779|0|With a plot lacking no urgency, Shrek 3 is a well-animated film containing a few standout, but ultimately throwaway sequences that don't do enough to sustain our interest.
17921|0|Like the TV series, the pic features makeup and special-effects gimmickry that are far less persuasive than what might be found at second-rate theme-park attractions.
12357|0|Though based on an original and respected novel, Hyams' horror thriller comes across as a pastiche of the genre's conventions as evident in major pictures of the past two decades, such as Jaws and the first two Alien films.
59504|1|Twentynine Palms is another in a string of recent French movies in which the body is no longer sacred, a churning, jerking, oozing machine. But Dumont seems to be working toward human discovery.
81181|1|In a scabrous follow-up to Happiness, Todd Solondz once again crafts a movie easier to admire than it is to like.
19812|0|The problem is that we've been given nothing to make us care for any of these people, so when the mysteries unravel there's nothing in the answers that hit us at a gut level.
7385|0|What had been a realistic work, lyric but realistic, slides into ostentatious symbolism.
48347|0|Only toward the end of the film do the hostilities reach a level of recklessness with any potential to be funny. If things had started at that pitch and been ramped up from there, Phillips might have had a movie worth making.

2465|1|Navy Seals stands out among this summer's violence-oriented pictures as the only one that doesn't leave your brain feeling like mashed potatoes.
61818|1|The first 10 minutes attain a deranged brilliance (especially considering Charlie Kaufman wouldn't introduce his own brand of narrative invention for another two years).

60524|1|By refusing to explain Ripley, this gets closer to Highsmith's character than any other film version.
16333|1|It is surprising that this film got out of the repressive clutches of China. Lu Liping gave a tremendous portrayal of motherhood.
24043|1|Much better than it seems it has a right to be.
19929|0|It'll leave you with a monster-rally headache and a craving for something salty.
16981|1|You can't help but like a film with as much verve, wit and (of course) gore as this one. A bloody good show.

72084|1|Good entertainment with superior acting performances and a stellar cast.
17621|1|A stunning starring vehicle for Cagney that shaped his career. Dated and a bit slow, but Cagney magnetism shines through even then.
74264|1|Arguably the funniest movie of the year.
72344|1|It's a goofy story, and it's far from a brilliant movie, but The Shaggy D.A. is a fun romp for a family to watch.
80797|1|Robson's film is still highly watchable, with Paul and Joanne pretending their marriage is on the rocks, and all sorts of machinations in the boardroom and the bedroom.
15349|0|What's interesting about typical Hollywood Christmas movies is that regardless of how crass, vulgar, or mean-spirited they may be, by the last scene they will inevitably try to wrap viewers in a blanket of warm seasonal cheer.
336|1|As it is a remake, it doesn't have the shock Lord Of The Rings possessed upon its release, but this is a beautiful beast of a B-movie, thrilling and touching.

43184|1|"""Tenacious D"" is a movie for fans of the hilarious spoof-rocking duo. You know who you are."
79250|1|Offbeat drama about a mystic with strange powers and a compassionate service of others.
4839|0|The plot announces that it's going to gyp us around, not because it has other things to offer, but out of the hope that we will let it off the hook.
12247|0|Owing more to the spirit of Oprah than to the Bard, pic serves up an earnest but unconvincing stew of received notions about family dysfunction, awkwardly put across by a script wheezing with melodramatic contrivances.
5922|0|Silent Fall, a dramatically repressed psychodrama, could be sued for creative malpractice.
49116|0|The seemingly can't-miss premise of teen-heartthrob gangsters gets lost in self-important direction, a shoddy script and muddled storytelling.

39267|1|Awnode's best balanced film...fun spy games.
76498|0|"High Spirits is a good time but the film is far from Jordan's best, and isn't quite what one would call ""memorable"", even with the fun effects and witty quips from O'Toole."
59770|0|"This ""comedy"" might be the Worst Movie Ever Seen, even with the aftershock of the Wayans Bros' Dance Flick still lingering."

377|1|Cushing's cool demeanour and grace were ideally suited to his role as the quietly manic Baron and he gives a chillingly subtle performance.

24454|1|For all that it is an incredible, and incredibly disturbing, film to look at, Hellraiser doesn't entirely click as a narrative.
13316|1|A soft, dusty, widescreen [old-school western]... an intelligent, sensitive drama with an epic scope, muted narrative and impressionistic heart.
41054|1|It does have the odd cheeky nod for the grown-ups -- and it is presented in inglorious 3D -- but it's also got a screenplay overflowing with charm, intelligence, wit and a real spark.
49595|0|Already overloaded with too many extraneous characters, this wobbly romance is thrown completely off balance by the Sonny/Billy subplot, which is more disturbing than warranted.

10647|0|Even though Mr. Norris collaborated on the screenplay and helped to choose the director (Joseph Zito), the movie treats him as if it wanted to prove that he has absolutely no future on the screen.

67610|1|Sometimes, under a torrent of social pressures, water runs faster, if not thicker, than blood, and even the strongest bonds drown in the flood.
25654|1|Jonathan Demme's astute adaptation of Thomas Harris' last good book entwines the horror and detective genres to enduringly shocking effect.
56911|1|To be sure, it's in an influential and powerful story -- but it comes off as considerably more shallow than the reality it claims to portray.

39548|0|The film's problems begin with its story, which is constructed with relentless manipulation in mind. It never plays fair with the audience.
70103|1|Hopkins makes a thoroughly convincing argument that the need for speed doesn't necessarily fade away in the so-called twilight years.
8041|1|Treats the ensuing issues of conscience and compromise with subtlety and warmth.
76491|1|Fey and Pohler are an appealing pair, with Fey's wry, deadpan delivery a perfect complement to Poehler's fearlessly juvenile brand of humor.
18656|1|A scary film about the very polluted hearts of two nasty white-collar workers.

29897|1|In the end, Suspect Zero is more interesting as filmmaking than it is as a thriller.
45941|1|If some of the political theorising is somewhat naive and the direction is occasionally manipulative, the acting, particularly from Juliette Binoche, is superb.
38935|1|an enjoyable ride for the modern western that it is
14142|0|Some of the dialogue is well-crafted and the performances are generally strong (although Black hams shamelessly at times) but the characters are so loathsome that you long for a hurricane to sweep away this wedding party.
4737|0|To cash in on footage from a film Lee did not finish before his death, producer Chow puts in a double and uses out-takes for this kung-fu mess.
77977|0|No audience, Canadian or otherwise, will learn anything here outside of the macabre facts. Worse, they won't feel anything either, not even -- and this is inexcusable -- for the victims themselves.
22641|0|It remains curiously hollow.
5753|1|While I truly do doubt that modern viewer will have much use for Jodorowsky's dated spiritual philosophy, the style with wich he expresses that philosophy is often quite exciting.

12114|0|It's basically a time killer with a lot of forgettable jokes that go on way too long many times...
20033|0|Someone ought to have thrown in the towel.
10783|1|While this version plays somewhat fast and loose with the original story, and even more so with the heroine's character, it is still much more Jane Austen than not.
44761|0|Dark thriller that does its best but ultimately doesn't completely convince.
44816|1|There are no big surprises, but Mac and director Charles Stone III hit all the right dramatic notes, and Angela Bassett is reliably smart and sexy as Mac's love interest.
23590|0|...aggressively, rampantly, jaw-droppingly dull.
11938|0|The triptych scheme underscores the basic blandness of Matthew Leitch as the hero, a cipher on the make.
17486|1|One finds in them the same unabashed enjoyment of color and movement, of spectacular athletics and outrageous stunts, that animates the Hong Kong action cinema as a whole and makes it so superbly entertaining.
47551|0|Starts out with tremendous promise, introducing an intriguing and alluring premise, only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter.
30360|0|The movie's only aspiration is to be a jacked-up re-jiggering of a name-brand horror 'classic.' It sets out to be not just schlock, but pre-chewed schlock.
78445|1|After you see it, you want to race out of the theater and recommend it to your sickest friends right away.
51143|0|A serviceable but ultimately forgettable crime comedy.
60644|1|Kinda dumb and tacky, but at least it's a real movie.
20425|0|What can one say about a film whose idea of comedy is having the two women sit around discussing whether or not they've had an 'organism' or not?
14301|0|Unspeakably ghastly.
78744|1|Cusack always manages to underscore panic with irony.
20536|1|Those with an interest in the art of stand-up will revel in this, and there's enough laughs to sustain it for those not looking to overintellectualize things.
50645|0|As satire, it's toothless and indulgent; as drama of conscience, it's not a patch on real life...
32853|0|Fantastic Four is terribly miscast. It's poorly written, visually uninteresting, and worst of all, boring. The film drags considerably. There are huge gaps without any action and it brings the pacing to an unbearable crawl.
77684|1|A lush, coming of age tale that makes you want to take a vacation.
1510|1|Minimalist, moody and morose, Lonesome Jim is a minor gem.
77651|1|A strong contender for one of the best films of the year.
41552|0|Light as air, My Name Is Bruce is good for a mild chuckle, not a belly laugh. As any Campbell fan knows, managing expectations is key to getting the most from his work.
2523|1|A strangely affecting romance with real heart - and another sign that Gosling is one of the best young actors around.
58093|0|The best twists that the movie can muster are a few miscalculations that the navigator makes -- he uses knots instead of miles in his fuel consumption math. Uh oh!

12788|0|Even on the mechanical level in which it was made, the number of jokes that don't work far outnumber the ones that do.
76514|1|In the end, you may not know Ray Johnson any better than his friends - you know stories, but not what motivated him to do what he did... Still, an interesting portrait.
44971|0|If it sounds stupid, that's because it is.
58961|1|Things to Come is an unusual picture, a fantasy, if you will, with overtones of the Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon comic strips. But it is, as well, a picture with ideas which have been expressed dramatically and with visual fascination.
8552|1|Lam brings a welcome kinetic energy to the chase scenes, and his action has that fast and furious quality unique to Hong Kong films.
9256|1|Even in an 'off' picture like Mr. Nice Guy, it is impossible not to like [Chan]; he's so open and good-natured and takes pride in what he does.
3300|1|Furie's film about the combat experience of five soldiers is one of the first movies about thr Vietnam War
64293|1|Certainly engaging to watch and often compelling to ruminate on.
17392|1|With Spall's marvelously sheepish performance setting the example, every second of every interaction in All or Nothing feels correct, honest and true.
33894|1|It's formulaic stuff but done with enough gusto to entertain.
43070|1|Spectacularly silly, stunningly colourful, and grounded by concise, unexaggerated direction.
18159|1|A great film to catch with your girlfriends or loved one. Mc Dreamy does not disappoint on the big screen.
10529|1|Oscar winner Gregory Peck is ideal casting as Atticus, for his Lincoln-like integrity and intelligence perfectly serve the role
57342|1|Had something a lot of other lame animated flicks haven't had over the past year and that was spunk, sarcastic humor and a quirky-enough story to keep my aging ass interested most of the way.
50566|1|Talky film; but brilliant. Sean Penn is at his best.
57395|1|Unfortunately, the material that De Palma chooses to hang his flair on feels like a paltry version of No Way Out as if penned by Crichton or Grisham.
59867|1|Annoying for readers of the comic who saw Tank Girl's 'history' being rewritten for the screen
41689|0|Like dramas by Pinter and others, what seems trenchant and perfectly pitched in the theater can come off as arch even when skillfully transferred to film.
382|0|Lower your expectations or drink a lot before you watch it.
6491|1|Controversial documentary best for older teens.
8850|1|Any film that features both Harry Dean Stanton and Ned Beatty as scam artists and its tale about religious hypocrisy borders on madness, is one not to be missed.
4961|1|Reese Witherspoon is a marvel.
42|1|In Connery it has a hero who is inescapably appealing.
16241|1|Posey is so likably weird.
38468|0|To paraphrase one of Chuck's girlfriends, this is a film that finds no shame in licking the sand off the balls of comedy.
18079|1|A big part of the movie's success is Huffman's irresistible and remarkable performance as Bree, a character we identify with rather than feel alienated by.
40092|1|A lot of thought and effort has been put into City of Ember but the whole is never more than the sum of its parts. It wants to be an adventure story and a fable and a mystery all at the same time and never quite decides what it is.
74633|1|Wilson ... makes this film, via grit of detail, a bit more than a Hallmark Special Retro Disney Walton sermon in values.
18319|1|Gleefully sordid, violent, good-humored exploitation from Russ Meyer, the thinking person's skin-flick director.
19393|1|A marvel of closely observed, intimately captivating moments.
40192|1|Cliched, much-maligned, but thoroughly enjoyable post-Vietnam war movie. Enjoyable ensemble led by Hackman.
47905|1|Tom Schulman's heartfelt script takes the main character's relationships with Keating above and beyond the usual student-teacher connection.
14004|1|It is enthralling and evocative, despite some flaws.
36332|0|Subsequent Pok√©mon battles give Nintendo the chance to showcase a few new characters, but equal effort is not made in the psychological arena.
49751|1|As frustrating and overbearing as parts of the film are, the inability to pin it down completely does makes it all the more watchable.
13329|1|A robust and rousing screen version of one of the greatest adventure stories ever written
16561|1|The story is also less violent and combative.
20340|1|A minor but enjoyable John Ford and John Wayne collaboration.
48161|1|A good example of making the differences work for you. Deep down, this is a film about childhood dreams and the determination to make those dreams come true. With such a positive message, you can't help yodeling on your exit from the theater.
6443|1|Nifty little thriller-on-rails.
56302|0|Those looking for violence and bad Italian stereotypes won't be bothered by the fact that they've seen almost all of this before.
16694|1|In the case of The Dirty Dozen, there isn't any camaraderie -- virtually every character in the film is a misfit and proud of it -- and, yet, it's probably one of the best entries in the genre.
62459|1|No wonder lesser minds hate this movie: it's radically different from Silence -- a bloody, suspense-driven, darkly comedic love story between good and evil, a florid, grandiose thriller manifesto on why polar extremes need each other to survive.
3885|0|Does anyone remember when Madonna was considered shocking?
79833|1|Call this one Fargo Lite, and you won't be far off the mark.
81365|0|It's gripping viewing but you feel like a voyeur of somebody else's pain. After a while you may feel that you're watching a particularly scenic snuff film.
51086|0|If you sit down to watch The Life of Emile Zola, skip the first third of the movie, because frankly, the beginning blows goats.
64101|0|Norton and Paul Giamatti perform wonders, but writer/director Neil Burger ruins the magic, exposing all of his story's tricks by the end.
8560|0|Ballad wears out one tale before its end.
73630|0|The story doesn't help Miss Beals either, because she's at her least convincing when having to register any emotion other than rapture.
47934|1|It's Joe Pesci who dominates the picture with his fierce performance as Tommy DeVito, an ill-tempered mobster who frequently displays the tendencies of a rabid wolverine.
35866|1|Scrooge works very nicely on its intended level and the kids sitting near me seemed to be having a good time.
16080|0|This TV-special-sized feature comprises songs from the trio's recent Burning Up tour, along with gobbets of behind the scenes action.
48110|1|Lee paints intimate characters who are about more than the game. Themes of integrity, honesty, loyalty and familial love are woven through the film resulting in a complex, thought-provoking human drama.
45580|1|A jovial, half-smart domestic comedy in which domesticity itself is a joke.
62860|1|Rough around the edges and careless with plot, but Bebe's Kids maintains personality throughout, doing justice to the memory of Harris and his most unusual stand-up creation.
72256|1|There's not a lot to it really--no deep underlying message other than an exploration of women's roles in society at the time.
69763|1|Takes the Disney princess and puts her in the real world, creating a chick flick with a little bit of edge, a whole lot of heart and and even more chemistry between the film's two leads.
73185|1|Not every gift of value comes in fancy packaging.
18127|1|You cannot look away from him. The performance is so . . . strange.
48410|1|It features some of the worst performances ever to besmeer the silver screen. These, coupled with a ridiculous plot, ludicrous special effects and several bizarre deaths make the film pass beyond the realms of 'so bad it's good' into downright hilarity.
12112|1|A Very Brady Sequel isn't great, but it's enjoyable.
16270|1|It's a cracking good yarn, well-told and impeccably acted, especially by Kr√≥l.
60798|1|Dick bares the graphic inconsistencies in the Hollywood ratings game, especially when it comes to the great divide between violence (bring it on) and sex (don't take it off).
31559|1|The most interesting aspect of the film is its depiction of the irreconcilable difference between someone's public and private personae.
33472|1|What's being said makes for invaluable mandatory listening.
80794|1|They simply do not build movies like this any more, which is a pity.
23704|1|It is a fun romp through the annals of cinema by pop Slovenian philosopher and prolific writer Slavoj Zizek, who finds deep psychological meaning in a slew of movies.
71310|1|While Ms. Morton embodies the role with furious intensity and with a raw yet waifish presence that brings both Emily Watson and Claire Danes to mind, Ms. Adler directs the film in ways that live up to its title.
16763|1|Escape from Alcatraz was the last of five films that Don Siegel directed with Clint Eastwood, and it's the end of an impeccable track record.
74720|0|It displays many of Flaherty's great strengths as a filmmaker, but it also showcases some of his weaknesses, which makes it an uneven film that is not in league with his earlier works.
75667|0|Preposterous lighthearted one-joke comedy.
40509|0|Nice try, but there's not a laugh in sight.
35230|1|That almost impossible feat, a great war picture that photographs the inner meaning, instead of the outward realism of World War II.
37564|1|David Cronenberg proves he doesn't have to use violence to tell a good story.
57925|1|Sergei Paradjanov's extraordinary merging of myth, history, poetry, ethnography, dance, and ritual... remains one of the supreme works of the Soviet sound cinema, and even subsequent Paradjanov features have failed to dim its intoxicating splendors.
11709|0|Bobby Jones deserves a better movie than this one.

67564|1|Mizoguchi is the poet laureate of Japanese cinema, gracefully exploring the battered but resilient souls in the cruel worlds of Japan's feudal past and present.
8619|1|A time capsule now of all that was considered controversial and gutsy in 1966.
40911|1|Surprisingly watchable
20476|1|perhaps the most post-9/11 film to have been made pre-9/11, capturing perfectly both the stirring discontent of the Nineties and the madness (both geopolitical and especially economic) that would erupt globally in the decade to come.

49804|0|Certainly not the tribute these kids and adults deserve.
74229|0|Apparently, director Eric Bross didn't care about lifelessness, cliches or Bass's Hallmark card-thin talents, because this movie is on autopilot.
31387|1|...if you don't find yourself giggling you're not of this Earth.
81727|1|Easier to like and admire than the album that spawned it.
59624|0|Where the film's ambitions crumble is in its avowed refusal to make its audience too uncomfortable.
36587|0|A satire that has the unfortunate tendency to take itself too seriously.
5850|1|Though not as wonderful as it might have been, this film is a must for Disney fans. Typical of the studio's films, it tugs at your heart while making you laugh.
59314|1|Pretty clever satire that holds up nicely
35874|1|Surprisingly powerful.
57932|1|Curtiz and Flynn at their apex
76228|0|What have we done to deserve this treacly, badly-acted nonsense? Whose children have we run over in a previous life?
978|0|Distinctive Bava look, distinctive incoherent plot. How did Joseph Cotten come to this?
31581|1|Alice Adams would be forgotten if it weren't for Hepburn's typically charismatic performance as the woman who turns social climbing into an art form.
32443|1|All of the performers are up for it, at turns witty and bright, clever and funny, tart and tragic.
52071|0|Not so much a nail-biting whodunit as it is a picture puzzle of a self-destructive type in overdrive, weaving from one misstep to another to, eventually and accidentally, the right answer.
14713|1|Not only is it hilarious, but it's a damn good detective story that has fun toying around with all the tired old conventions of the detective story
19710|0|There's the draw from the audience of potential scares and the good cast, but there's nothing ever delivered to us.
72676|0|A stilted and ponderous epic about Napoleon's failed Russian invasion of 1812.
38942|0|This is one of the more maddening franchises going right now, because so much potential is being wasted by director Len Wiseman, who can't seem to get the formula right.
28343|1|A disappointing follow-up to Timur Bekmambetov's ground-cracking debut that still holds just enough explosiveness to blow a few fuses in your brain. Watch for the set-pieces (killer balls, car chases, power lines used as whips) and ignore the rest.
17866|1|Prince of the City features a whole variety of different acting talents, each of them shining in small, but effective roles.
5501|1|Cuts to the bone and stays there long after its end credits have finished rolling.
17688|1|Mon Oncle D'merique is a philosophical puzzle that lingers in the mind long after the closing credit.

25230|1|Not as bad as you'd expect
4705|1|Time might not have been kind to the look of WarGames, but with nuclear war still a very real threat, the picture's ability to manufacture suspense remains undimmed.
50630|1|What are you waiting on? Go see this one!
72878|1|There is almost nothing slipshod about the film and I suspect that it will only seem more impressive the further we get from the flurry of hype ...
16085|0|A hunk of sentimental fluff that boasts an often-overstated performance by Cage and an annoying turn by Leoni.
2946|0|If you care at all about surface plausibility, adults who act like adults, or emotions that exist anywhere other than in manipulative movies, spare yourself and spare your family.
13687|0|What a waste of potential.

31173|1|[This] film, with a heroine who is sometimes a hero and who is apt to show up in a red corset with matching red-and-blond skunk hairdo, can hardly be for everyone. But the right audiences are bound to appreciate the originality displayed here.

38424|1|It's clear that video-game-designer-turned-director Shinsuke Sato knows what he's got: when the action settles down, he wisely hangs the camera on his alluring stars.
80868|1|The sorrow is real, the pity is palpable - but Richard Pryor should have let someone else film his life story.
37897|0|Lumet made the regrettable choice of sacrificing credible character development and a worthy script for the sake of maintaining Hasidic authenticity and attenuated scenes of religious observances.

50692|0|Rosenbush's cinematic experiment generates so little excitement I doubt whether you'll hear even the sound of one hand clapping.
33186|1|De Bont has assembled it with masterly precision. And Speed looks terrific. There are breathtaking aerial shots, mind-boggling stunts, and camera positioning that you just don't expect. It's a rocketing eyeful.
59947|1|If you're looking for a gripping narrative then look elsewhere; enjoy the B-movie effects and crash zooms, melodramatic acting, eclectic soundtrack, Hockney-esque visuals and Bowie's effortless charisma instead.
11561|1|Displaying what is both good and bad about Allen, Anything Else has enough laugh out loud moments to make it worthwhile.
40715|0|It's an impressive moving wax museum, certainly, but even metatextual follies eventually need a pulse.

19301|1|Gary Cooper brings the Yankee legend to life with great honesty and emotion.
48174|1|There are enough bright moments to make this a passable hot-weather entertainment, if not one worth slogging through a blizzard for.
4864|1|Despite its flaws, this is a film that looks great, includes a memorable Hopkins performance, and is well enough written to keep us thinking rather than latching onto stereotypes.
19345|0|Imagine if somebody came up to you, grabbed your head, and jiggled it around for 80 minutes. Now imagine they did that while you were trying to watch a movie about a monster attacking New York City.
34672|1|The roughness around the edges of The Jungle Book are part of what makes it such a classic.
38166|0|It's still enjoyable, but never as strong as it should be.
63988|1|Truth be told, this movie's worth exists solely in its imaginative technique. Filmed conventionally, Time Code would be a waste of time. Filmed the way it is, Time Code is a fascinating exercise in new technology.

22624|1|If ever there was a town that displayed the spirit of America, this is it.
18403|1|Is it the best comedy ever made? I don't know, but it surely is the funniest.I stand by that. And don't call me Shirley.
39927|1|Kurosawa achieves the piercing emotion and poetry of the Italian neorealists, but by opposite means: he doesn't make the camera disappear; instead... he deploys his camera so sharply and unerringly that it seems to take X-rays of the spirit.

1896|1|A handcrafted masterpiece.
5108|0|Look at the star. Look at the director. See something else.

20015|0|A predictable and contrived, yet somewhat enjoyable film that was spoiled by the preview.
37257|1|Though the whodunnit takes a fairly predictable course, the Spanish Civil War background adds powerful narrative and symbolic weight, while the striking imagery is simply poetic.

8478|1|Gripping suspense in this southern set drama. Sandra Bullock is oddly matched to McConaughey who lights the fire. Unfortunately, Samuel L. Jackson waits in the wings.
61665|0|The drama is hung on a vendetta between a flawed-but-honourable man and a doggedly bad cop. Yes, it's Valjean and Javert, together again.

16093|0|Audiences unfamiliar with the first film will be hard put to follow the action [from a story by Brian Clemens] as it incoherently hops about in time and space.
2391|0|Mark my words: There is no way an innocent like Tien and a Meat Loaf-style heartthrob like Bai could ever make a love thing happen.

26823|1|The whole thing is ultimately just a '50s B-movie, but it's hard to imagine what they could have done to make it a better one.
4848|1|Scream 3 is a fine ending to the trilogy. The teen horror franchise that ate itself.
53284|1|Stevens' classic Western, with its inflated reputation, now looks as if it were self-consciously intended as a landmark film right from the start.

48977|1|There's poignant drama in this brash, sometimes overstated film, and Muriel's transformation is truly touching.
13835|1|Ryder and Hawke bring crucial authenticity to their roles with effortless appeal. You'll find yourself wanting more of these characters than the movie gives you.
17646|0|Has moments of style and audacity, but the script is a shameless muddle and the shifts in tone -- from gooey romance to hard-driving, hyper-pop action -- give the impression that the movie was directed by six or seven people in alternating shift.
65433|1|Funny to think that the font movie would have the potential to restore one's faith in art and its myriad meanings, but it does.
11372|1|Thanks to Philipps's explosive need and Christensen's struggling vulnerability, we see the human costs inherent in tragedy once the TV trucks have left and only the haunting remains.
2619|0|The plot is ludicrous, which in itself would be perfectly acceptable given sharper handling, but both script and direction devote so much time to romantic undercurrents that the central intrigue is further divested of credibility.
11002|0|Boat Trip goes bottoms up early.
72301|0|... this is a movie that will lose nothing when you rent it from Netflix a few months from now.
3374|1|Not all of the stories work and the ones that do are thin and scattered, but the film works well enough to make it worth watching.
46688|0|The pic's chills are top-notch, but its underlying mockish tone won't please die-hard fans.
2847|0|If Town & Country were a play, it would already have closed.
62175|0|This confusing, silly story from writer-director Michael Crichton concerns hypnotic TV commercials, models, and stun guns.
30179|1|"No one dreams of the twilight transpiring in ""Away From Her,"" but, in its words, it's not bad luck. It's just life. You can't beat life. A tenderly told tragedy about Alzheimer's Disease's erosive effects, Sarah Polley's film avoids movie-of-the-week sap."
59733|0|These are the same performers who appear on the TV show, and you get the feeling this has become more than a meal ticket for them. Hokey dialogue is invested with an intensity that takes you out of the movie and into the psyches of the actors.
38600|0|Plays like a 90-minute version of the old television show. That's not necessarily bad.
17622|1|A rather superficial and limited probe of American male sexual hypocrisies.
6162|1|It's Lynchian--Bu√±uelian, too.
64910|1|Scott gets strong performances from his supporting cast (Quick is sensual and effective) and is able to salvage the movie through the alchemy of the striking visuals.
26946|0|Has neither the imagination nor the reach of Forrest Gump.
60015|1|An imaginatively constructed soap-opera with a high-powered cast, this film follows several narrative threads, all involving unfulfilled Los Angeles women who find inner peace after learning there are worse things than loneliness.
7016|1|As the idea is no longer fresh and the plot has basically the same structure, it doesn't quite match the original. But the sequel delivers enough new developments to keep it interesting.
4566|0|Shamefully sadistic, achingly dull and totally predictable, it rehashes the far superior 1984 original.
5855|1|Bartel's cult classic paved the way for many rude satires about sex, murder, and cannibalism.
15042|0|Any romantic comedy that gives you time to think probably isn't doing its job.
60920|1|A solid, involving Danish drama that proves discord, struggle and variance need not necessarily be lost in translation.
12183|1|After the compromised result of the noirish At Close Range, Foley shows imporovement in giving Jim Thompson's 1955 tale the right tone and visuals, though he should have cast the femme fatale with a better actress than Rachel Ward.
14878|0|"Given the amazing artwork, if a better character [than a cyborg John Silver] had been inserted, we'd be talking about ""Treasure Planet"" as another Disney classic."
41844|0|Somewhere along the line, the movie version of Sex and the City got too much Botox injected into the script, and all the life was ironed out of it.

63410|1|Too-long Grisham thriller is full of adult themes.

59345|1|After this film's considerable success at the box office, Abbott and Costello made seven more pictures in which they 'met' Hollywood monsters, but none were as lively and entertaining as this one.

2867|0|Under the direction of Adrian Lyne, most of the picture's situations seem like randomly chosen place holders, flat events that just fill time until the final bizarre confrontation.
68435|1|Deviating from the standard Hollywood biopic, Sheridan's chronicle told with candor, realism, and humor the story of paraplegic writer-artist Christy Brown, embodied in a tour-de-force Oscar-winning performance by Daniel Day-Lewis.
16371|0|Unmistakably feels like a rough cut of a possibly good movie.
40105|1|It is almost scary to realize that this film has given me a fair chance of predicting what lies ahead for these strangers. I almost understand the motives of those who chose to drop out of the experiment.
33552|1|Legendary horror director George A. Romero takes this material seriously and lends a real intimacy -- and real dread -- to it.
67858|1|Few films are as magical, and none are more haunting than this monumental work.
61077|1|A takeoff on Douglas Sirk's overwrought, color-saturated 1950s melodramas that rises above its camp roots and converts artifice into art.
39414|1|The next Serious movie could well be something special.
41777|0|Simply crashes upon takeoff, going nowhere in a hurry, sniffing around for pop culture overkill and domestic depression insight it never makes a genuine play to explore.
5098|0|It didn't work for me, I got no warm and fuzzy feeling for this working-class family.
6738|1|Engaging, bittersweet and frequently laugh out loud funny, this is an enjoyable Spanish drama with strong performances and a subtle but effective message.
1013|0|A hopelessly, shallow 'reality' movie.
53173|1|Great, but young kids may be bored and restless.
77830|1|Well meaning but too similistic and earnest melodrama that juxtaposes two types philosophies of how to raise a brilliant kid
1919|0|"Danger: when your suspense film ends and you don't care who really did ""it"", whatever ""it"" is, you might want to rethink the plot."
19969|0|"Much of the film is crude, full of ""Visit San Francisco"" photography and Matthau isn't on the same great form as he was as the transit cop in The Taking of Pelham One Two Three."
7898|1|A finely made drama about a seriously disturbed family.
57240|1|A better grubby guy/hot chick fable than Knocked Up, certainly much more honest about its male-fantasy status
867|0|Garlin's clearly inspired by his own experiences living as someone who's fat and funny, but being honest isn't the same thing as being perceptive.
16983|0|Probably the worst of the series. Still provides a few laughs.
14795|0|Seagal -- who turns 50 in a few weeks -- has been inactive for the past few years, and it shows.
63330|1|The laws of physics no longer apply, if they ever did; characters leap, run at neck-breaking speed, bash each other through several walls with one blow.
12087|1|Savage little morality tale.
10922|0|Clunky, disjointed and with a couple of subplots that linger and then vanish.
62430|0|It's a far cry from his classic American thrillers or his brilliant British noir, Night and the City.
69863|0|They'
56089|0|In the end, that's all this film is: flames, flying bullets, and special effects. It could be worse, I suppose, but as long as people go into this film with their eyes open, there shouldn't be any surprises.
67794|1|a fascinating introduction to innovative film technique
16553|1|Stlick, stylish and ineffably cool, this was perhaps McQueen's defining role. Also mention goes to the uncreditied star of the film; San Francisco.
7139|0|The film is directed by Wally Wolodarsky from a script by Joe Jarvis and Greg Coolidge. These are names to remember, in order to avoid them in the future.
17914|0|It's not funny. It is occasionally witty, but not very often. It seems the filmmakers realized that as well as they fill the frequent dry spells with physical comedy that doesn't really fit the tone of the movie.
81306|1|Beautifully portrayed by Christopher Lee, the Monster is almost heartbreaking, flailing confusedly with a pained expression on its patchwork face.
36289|1|Tim Burton's first (and best) movie...

20301|1|Wong's always-striking visual style uses floating, neon colors and extreme angles to emphasize disconnected souls.
19970|0|It's a nice story, and it does feel good, but it's too formulaic and syrupy
39467|0|You'll be sorry if you bring your kids.

2230|1|Okay star vehicle for Whoopi
9814|1|It needs to be seen and appreciated, like a serpent in a glass cage.
19763|0|The fairly simple storyline...is certainly stretched quite thin over the two hour running time.
8673|1|There is enough intrigue to keep it interesting, and if it ever feels too slow, try counting the number of people who get betrayed. I lost count around betrayal number one billion.
44386|1|Good performances and a firm directing hand make this worthwhile despite the distasteful subject matter.
44782|0|If there's an amnesia movie worse than Overboard, it slips my mind.
7560|1|Fresnadillo's film is an undeniable triumph and one that horror fans will love for decades to come.
57415|0|Readers wondered how those cinemen would succeed in putting the whole story into a single picture. As revealed last week, the answer is extremely simple. Warner Brothers do not succeed in anything of the sort because they do not try.
8962|1|If you haven't seen it for a while, you may have forgotten just how fantastic the snappy dialogue, visual gags and genuinely heartfelt story is.
40377|1|Mr. Hanks's suave smart-alecky manner owes a lot to Bill Murray, but he's funny and engaging even if he isn't doing anything new.
20337|1|Stone, who's known for his excess, offers a few voiceover lines that border on the cheesy, but other than that it's a pretty straightforward realistic tour of duty. And that's what makes it so powerful.
5648|0|Amiable and affable, but only occasionally successful in making pertinent observations about the ongoing battle of the sexes.
76324|0|You end up with a movie that's never more than harmlessly entertaining and adequate -- I doubt the filmmaker was aiming so low.
15254|0|The plot itself is simple. The twists are simply thrown in to make it seem complex.
15912|1|Arranged in short episodes, each composed entirely of awkward and embarassed conversation between midlevel celebs, Coffee and Cigarettes entertains fitfully.
17986|1|Lesser Billy Wilder with great actresses and a weak leading man.
48640|0|Above all, it's an exercise in cryptic Dylan self-mythology.
16497|1|Sid and Nancy has some claim on being the finest British film of the 1980s.
81536|1|It's an enjoyable picture, well-cast and carefully 'opened up' from its stage roots.
15530|1|There's something cheerfully perverse about filming a thriller and then tossing out the parts that would help it make sense, but Wim Wenders has a certain success with the method.
10348|1|There's more to this crime-thriller than meets the eye.
15067|1|An extremely disturbing tale of escalating peer pressure.
9982|1|A haunting, riveting film that's as self-serving as it is revelatory. It's movie-making as therapy, and I hope it worked.
33229|0|Successful until the rusty workings of its story gears start to show.
21535|1|Too sprawling and disappointingly sentimental, this family saga is nonetheless Gregory Nava's breakthrough feature, made on a larger canvas with bigger budget and name cast (Jimmy Smits, Edward James Olmos, Esai Morales).
50146|0|There is not any plot worth discussing: people go into a desert, some die. The end.
14358|1|This irrepressible and sensitive romance brings new flavor to the term odd couple.
8798|1|More an assembly of funny sketches, Buck Privates still plays very funny without much of a story behind it.
38534|1|There is hardly a thing I can say in its favor, except that I was cheered by nearly every minute of it.
23757|1|Typically creepy Stephen King fodder.
7136|1|Murphy's likeable, the script's laden with a gaggle of one-liners, and there's even a vague message nestling beneath the zoological chaos.
13126|1|It's easy to drift away from the story and become absorbed in Minnelli's impossibly delicate textures, but there is a little something here for everybody.
14826|1|Whatever its shortcomings, The Saint of Fort Washington takes its subject very seriously, in ways that no audience can fail to find wrenchingly sad.
2314|0|I'd rather watch 90 minutes of a flickering yule log video than sit through this overcooked Christmas goose again.
42743|0|...isn't so much a bad movie as an unfinished movie
10711|1|Fun, flashy musical with Banderas in early role.
9172|0|Stale slapstick and predictable, raunchy sight gags (usually involving a banana).
36860|1|The rise of Valentine and the fall of Winthorpe are a source of great fun.
19589|1|Beineix choreographs the actors and the camera into a stunning and stylish cinematic dance... This is not a musical in the strict sense of the word but it certainly feels like one in the way it moves.
26468|1|Move beyond the lame title, and you'll find an unexpectedly good movie, with the inspired casting of Drew Berry and Hugh Grant possessing the necessary chemistry to lift this rote, manufactured story into something appealing.
4187|0|Tedious and mundane.
10562|0|Neither as fun nor as faithful to the spirit of the original comics. It's a bigger, slicker movie, but not a better one.
48729|1|A compelling addition to the long tradition of artful French film adaptations of works of mystery and suspense literature.
70810|1|Ideal Sunday afternoon fare.
69853|0|Not one gratuitous 'Git-Er-Done!' was uttered during the composition of this review.
66882|1|Cinema verite at its very best!
45578|1|"[VIDEO] Set in postwar New York, ""Imitation of Life"" is a wonderfully deceptive film."
43573|1|Despite the film's low rent look, Ferrara has an eye for detail and style.
677|1|A hip indie version of Truffaut's Day for Night, Living in Oblivion celebrates the very act of filmmaking as grand folly, a triumph of absurdist heroism.
78145|0|As far as mindless cookie-cutter action movies go, you could certainly do much worse than Rapid Fire, though that's hardly a ringing endorsement.
2511|1|Blues Brothers 2000 isn't anywhere close to the landmark its predecessor was, but it's still enjoyable.
20570|0|... a great big ol' commercial for the Wal-Mart
11726|1|A low-rent Psycho-like flick that's more creepy than scary.
8422|0|The film paints with swaggeringly broad strokes, the basic thesis being Lennon = good, government = bad.
54753|1|Bodrov's movie turns this barren no man's land into an extraordinary stage.
58057|0|Director Irwin Winkler is as graceless as ever, although the gritty look and refreshingly low-tech action sequences are welcome.
12536|0|A slog through determined wackiness, it's apt to leave audiences cold.
55071|0|Its script is pure corn, drenched in syrupy sentiment and topped with prize ham in the shape of Billy Bob Thornton's tub-thumping coach.
20943|1|Apart from some minor audio problems, Persuasion is a truly enjoyable film that captures the time period in an amusing, revealing manner and is educational for all ages.
8836|1|'Rich with meaning or a sublime prank, Dogville gets to you.'
11905|1|If it could happen to these kids, smart and beautiful, then it sure as shit is going to happen to me.
41430|1|There are occasional flashes that the film may be patronizing the lower end of the blue-collar mentality, as much if not more than the characters who keep putting Rocky down on the screen. However, Avildsen is noted for creating such ambiguities.
56215|1|intelligent script and economical direction make this a rare non-political Israeli work that everyone can relate to
28706|1|An impeccable choreography of vows broken, shuffled and reaffirmed
8003|0|"It's not good when you check your watch every 20 minutes during a 107-minute movie. It's bad when you think, ""Yeaahh, rrright"" almost as often."
13504|1|Metafiction is a dangerous game to play ...but it's apparent writer-director Dowse has faith. Let's hope that faith is rewarded; we need more of this kind of quirky satire.
74246|1|Fab small-town spoof; subtle humor may bore kids.
7590|0|Judged purely as a piece of escapist popcorn fun, Collateral Damage only barely passes muster.
61925|1|Fortunately, the film rarely slows down long enough to proselytize, especially in the hellish refugee-camp climax, a horrid polyglot of ceaseless conflict that could be any war zone on the planet.
17910|0|It looks and feels junky.
72290|1|So-so Bob Hope version of Ruggles of Red Gap. Bright songs help.
69918|1|I have no way of knowing exactly how much is exaggeration, but I've got a creepy feeling that the film is closer to the mark than I want to believe.
51286|1|Still a fantastic fable with some excellent animation and a great story
7165|0|A grisly gangster movie with moral pretensions, 10th and Wolf never transcends mobster cliches recycled from The Godfather, Donnie Brasco and GoodFellas.
55496|0|The year may be young but it's going to take something extraordinary to top this as the worst film of 2002.
42413|0|The awkward exposition, the fitful comic relief, the contrived plot devices - all these things reminded me of Left Behind and other films produced by and for the Christian subculture.
22060|1|The nature photography is excellent, and real-life husband and wife McKenna and Travers are very good, their genuine affection transferring to the screen.
48164|1|Okay entertainment held together by the chemistry of the cast

55860|1|The greatest movie about religion.
55736|1|It's about two-thirds a great movie and worth it for those two-thirds.
3725|1|It's sweet, it's touching, it's occasionally pretty corny -- but I've got a soft spot for this one all the same.
12694|1|Brutally ugly and irresistably entertaining.
15937|1|In a season of smug, telegraphed quirkiness (hello, Little Miss Sunshine), the rambling Nacho Libre, like director Jared Hess' previous Napoleon Dynamite, feels like an original.
69633|1|A skillful, if by-the-numbers, horror pic.
31386|1|The subplots involving D'Angelo and Newton and Ethan Embry -- the Griswolds' son, who can't stop winning -- have their charms.
46102|1|Despite sliding into melodrama a bit too often, From Here to Eternity remains a decent film due to the strong performances of its Oscar-nominated cast.

15229|1|The English Patient's considerable pleasures are chiefly aesthetic, not emotional.

53149|1|Not at all the stiff costume drama bore I thought this movie was going to be.
15047|0|"As Spacek, Lange and Keaton clamor for attention, ""Crimes of the Heart"" becomes less a movie than a three-ring circus, and ringmaster Beresford does little to direct your gaze."
52361|1|It's funny and inventive, though not greatly helped by 3D.
46835|1|Presents a slow and leisurely look at sexual politics in and out of marriage.
8334|1|While it is one part a coming-of-age story and one part a story of girls and mothers, Girlhood is just as much about the attainment of wisdom.
25058|1|The Big Sleep, though, is witty and sinister, and in an odd way is a realistic portrayal of big-city life with Arabian Nights overtones.
23586|1|One of the cerebral master's classics.
45757|1|Arguably, the best American western ever made
8274|1|Enormously entertaining mystery-comedy, that is also filled with feminist and political commentary.
26898|0|It's fast-paced and full of gaudy action, yet it's thoroughly unsatisfying, largely because it's so lazy.
2217|1|microcosm of the Japanese post-war experience

13585|1|Very exciting and entertaining.
43381|0|As usual, Billy Bob is very watchable in the lead. But the rest of the film is only so-so.
52762|1|An amphibian movie which introduces us to the world of the deaf and then moves gracefully into universality as it explores the difficulties we all face in love relationships.
5882|0|The whole movie is so generic feeling and such a blatant waste of precious smart-comedy resources, I can't advise anyone to see it. I gave it Network with Snacks because Jason Bateman needs a vehicle for his brilliance wherever he can get one.
51299|1|Terrific acting by Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges.
63610|0|A truly dreadful film. Preminger can't be faulted for ambition, but for once, his execution is sorely lacking.
10207|1|Oddly being marketed as a comedy by its distributor, The Savages is best approached as a drama with an intermittently light touch that's generally more of a curse than a boon.
24189|1|Although based around a familiar, Rashomon-style concept, Vantage Point ratchets up its intensity so effectively that the lack of originality hardly matters.
13500|1|Excessive but occasionally inspired, Excalibur gives us grimy lumbering knights, gloomy castles, slithering dragons, mesmerizing magic, and (of course) the struggle between good and evil.
72899|1|It works because it's smart, knows it's smart, announces to us that it's smart - then backs off and lets the suspense and dark comedy mix.

43380|0|Drama that's not dramatic enough and comedy that's not funny enough.

70169|0|Disney's 35th animated feature may be based on a timeless tale, but it's no classic.
29137|1|Robert Aldrich dissects the underlying ideas with just enough craft and thoughtfulness to make the implications of this gritty 1966 war drama unsettling in not entirely constructive ways.
42554|1|Neil Jordan's unsettling spin on the old Red Riding Hood themes.
6493|1|I love Carpenter, and I like Christine well enough, but I'm not as enthusiastic about it as I am about other King films.

78189|1|Above average coming of age story.
71831|1|Fernando Meirelles, codirector of City of God, stresses old-fashioned storytelling and takes full advantage of his cast, including Danny Huston.

63919|1|a fair first effort
77872|1|One of greatest filmmaking achievements of the 1990s.

1536|1|What if women took over the world? That's the premise of this hypnotically alluring Federico Fellini film.
8402|0|It's late January, winter is entrenched, and in the lull between the bounty of Christmas and the renewal of spring, the big screen can sometimes seem barren -- a movable famine.
26172|1|Mr. Black's screenplay is mean-spirited, but it earns its keep with sharp, sarcastic dialogue and ingenious ways of setting up this story.

42127|0|The movie takes on a somber, fitful atmosphere of straining epic proportions. But it strays into an episodic bog that leaves it gasping for dramatic life.
25537|1|A simply told story that says more about racism than many NAACP-approved films.
48132|1|From our first glimpse of a surfer hovering through a cascading wave to the final sky-diving stunt, Kathryn Bigelow's fourth feature keeps offering us new thrills with unapologetic verve.
33583|1|Herzlinger comes across as kind of a nebbishy Everyman, except funnier, luckier, and in possession of the most tolerant, supportive friends on the planet.
11643|1|Despite a known outcome, James Marsh's documentary offers sublime thrills - grafting the tense suspense of a heist film onto an existential dissection of artistic accomplishment and true friendship.
47596|1|It might be dumb and corny, but I actually liked this flick.

47724|1|Kids will love it, parents may not.
37935|1|Like its two predecessors, 1983's Koyaanisqatsi and 1988's Powaqqatsi, the cinematic collage Naqoyqatsi could be the most navel-gazing film ever.

44331|1|Enjoyable romantic comedy suffers from excess length.
50062|1|A solid attempt to wrestle with some big questions. The cast is exemplary and the premise and script are well reasoned and artful. But it doesn't quite come together.
23396|0|Never rises to the realm of exciting.
21735|0|Too few of the jokes worked.
47039|0|Since there's no shortage of enjoyably bad movies out there, why settle for processed cheese when there's real cheddar to be devoured?
13667|1|The film's good heart keeps it from ever making fun of Muriel, although there are moments that must have been tempting.
36235|1|An exceptionally literary film that at the same time employs extremely theatrical set design. Leave it to the mad genius of Denmark to kick cinema's ass once again.

33051|0|A creepy performance by Anne Carlisle makes this watchable
73961|1|Catchphrases and sexual innuendo abound in goofy sequel.
25543|0|...basically a military-recruitment commercial.
62013|1|The film is often confusing, especially during the first half, but Gabin and Ventura are well cast as hoods and Moreau is as appealing as ever as an underworld temptress.
92|1|The biggest crime surrounding I Confess is the generally indifferent reception that the film has received over the years
41064|0|Unloads a volley of plot twists that'll have you slapping your head in disbelief, provided you haven't figured them out by the end of Act I.
992|1|Malkovich steals the show and director Liliana Cavani ... does a perfectly serviceable job.
67066|1|...a periodically spellbinding yet grossly overlong endeavor that could've used a few more passes through the editing bay.
16136|1|In a fall season that's already given us its share of turkeys, there should be room for any film as handsome and touching as this one.
1492|1|Hilarious but raunchy parody is filled with sex, profanity.
76727|1|You're still gonna need those tissues.
32650|1|Overwrought to contemporary eyes, perhaps, but still troubling and, in its own way, powerful.
6545|0|When the story begins to turn toward Josie's growing relationship with her attractive English teacher, Sam Coulson (Michael Vartan), the movie begins to unravel because it's dealing with a subject that is above its grasp.
22558|0|Goes soft and mushy in personal terms even as it ratchets up the violence and decibel level.
9246|1|Arguably Woody Allen's funniest movie.
50073|1|A fine light comedy, with unexpected passages of seriousness, marked by the Donen touch in its adventurous visuals and vivacious performances.
10530|1|Pixar classic is one of the best kids' movies of all time.
28974|0|Stiles's character is finally too opaque, and the mind games she plays on Channing aren't clever or cruel enough to produce a satisfying denouement.
30585|0|This would have worked better as a short documentary.
61434|0|Slick, clever and entertainingly overheated while you're watching it, Basic Instinct starts to evaporate the second you leave the theater.
38305|0|A disappointing film, Remo Williams was meant as a star vehicle for Fred ward and as the first chapter of a franchise, but, alas, neither thing happened.
53327|0|Who's Your Caddy isn't just a wretched exercise in formulaic hack writing, lazy acting and appalling stereotyping -- it's also just sort of icky.
29296|1|A wonderful present that's perfect for anytime of the year.
2469|0|Tthe enthusiastic hamming can't hide the clunking direction by Sidney J Furie and the sub-standard special effects.
14922|0|Reasonably entertaining for the first half-hour, after which your eyelids will be heavy.
2684|1|Though it's set in urban New York, the jungle in this morality tale is similar to the one in Stone's former film, Platoon: In both, Charlie Sheen plays a youth torn between two father figures representing Good (Martin Sheen) and Evil (Michael Douglas)
4356|0|I understand the satirical import of the race gags. But 97% of the movie will make you need a shower. Possibly two.
17826|1|Its built-in fanbase (thanks to the best-selling novel) is ready to swoon. I'm not one of those swooners but even I had a great time indulging in the earnest urgency.
27514|1|Feuerzeig's kaleidoscopic film is the perfect frame for Daniel Johnston's odd world.
6292|1|"it's truly laudable that the band let them keep filming, even after what was originally intended to be a ""making of"" puff piece turns into an intense psychodrama."
47122|1|There are just enough interesting characters, along with dozens of fresh ideas relating to ping-pong, to keep the audience along for the ride.
35944|1|This is a very funny idea, made all the more entertaining by the actors going over the top - Ze show is unjinxable.
78485|1|Rozema is a fabulist with a strong visual sense, and she creates a distinctive, enclosed world to illustrate Camille's odyssey.
6366|1|...the film features horny teens being chased around a shopping mall by clunky robots that shoot lasers. What more do you need to know?
70203|0|"It's resounding bunk, candied over with the lush music of Johnny Clegg and hyped to death by director John (""Rocky"") Avildsen."
70907|0|Naipaul fans may be disappointed. Those who are not acquainted with the author's work, on the other hand, may fall fast asleep.
40450|1|Unexpectedly warm and huggable, and far funnier than you'd ever guess... one of the wittiest, most endearing holiday films in recent memory.
39930|0|Minimalist acting is only interesting--and it can, of course, be intensely interesting--when it isn't providing a desperate cover for thematic inscrutability.
73777|1|Producer Dore Schary, in association with Adrian Scott, has pulled no punches.
53295|0|Anyone coming to this work for the first time should be forewarned that the will generate more giggles (and perhaps a yawn or two), but there is absolutely nothing here to fear.
27272|1|It's huge, overbudget, dazzling, and entertaining, but you'd be hard-pressed to remember more than one or two of the characters or specific events.
5647|1|One of the finest incarnations of the series.....a warm and fuzzy experience
22016|0|The film is fascinating, but sort of like watching a road accident.

77299|0|Skinny on plot, story, directing and some of the acting.
58647|0|...tries desperately to capture the spirit of a high-energy farce.
80630|1|The surreal opening scene, featuring an armor-clad flamethrower-brandishing villain, is a clear indicator that few things in this film should be taken seriously.
1948|1|Young Guns is best watched in the playful, none-too-serious spirit in which it was made.
46095|0|A surprisingly dull comedy with a smart cast and a predictably uninteresting script.
43023|1|It's an amazingly sharp, nasty little thriller that takes a silly situation and squeezes it to the core, vicious as a heart attack.
12027|0|88 Minutes is the sort of overblown thriller in which every action, no matter how insignificant, is pregnant with portent, yet it's a film of nothing but red herrings.
44975|0|Only a fan would be inclined to tolerate this dunderheaded mystery.
7430|0|Most of the focus is on Sheffer, whose character is too enigmatic, while Epps , Berry and Swanson gamely try to pull for extra dramatic yardage but can't do much with their underwritten roles.
55366|1|A Love Song for Bobby Long's trio of lead performances are surprisingly believable.
19422|0|A living testament to how low a studio will stoop to generate a few bucks.
31206|1|It is hard to mix moods -- the film is manic, subtle, comic and vaguely sad -- but [Jonze] does it masterfully.
4385|0|Though based on a true story, this grueling drama is peopled by characters that have been fictionalized into big house cliches.
38395|1|"Like a favorite novel, ""Wonder Boys"" gets more comfortably broken-in with each return, and Michael Douglas wears Grady Tripp's scruffiness as sharply as he does Gordon Gekko's natty clothes - addressing jealousy, panic and terror in creative complacency."
47772|0|More like Night of the Living Dead.
20144|0|A brainless plot would be almost forgiveable were it not for the perverse depiction of innocents butchered in Invasion U.S.A.
80585|1|Perhaps its greatest truth comes from two of its characters watching a movie in production: one notes that the film is more a love story than a horror story. Replies the movie's director, 'Sometimes the two are indistinguishable.'
59580|1|At least half-kidding most of the time, it's a playful nervous breakdown, alight with ideas and joy.
12197|0|Possibly aware that they have something less than a classic on their hands, the makers of MAC and Me have cut their losses by making the film into a kind of cinematic billboard: all space is for sale.
46778|0|A weak little piece of junk romantic comedy, mercilessly and lazily and literally using nostalgia as a method of manipulation.
37590|1|"Good-natured, melodic and sweet as can be, ""Music and Lyrics"" is like listening to your favorite '80s compilation: It just plain makes you feel good."
45205|1|[It] toys with convention, leading us down that happy ending path and then hopping off of it again. It's refreshing, if not humorously frustrating.
72653|0|A Blair Witch- style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera, with passable performances from everyone in the cast.
38492|0|As a movie, it's mediocre. As a clue to Coppola's thinking, it shows he still has things to learn about the relation between technology and expression.
29632|1|Capturing the Friedmans is an unforgettable film that will have you talking long afterwards.
16529|0|Sex Drive starts off well, but quickly deteriorates into a compilation of rehashed jokes that go for the lowest common denominator every time.
34648|1|I didn't hate Torque, and I guess that goes to say some things for the film. At the very least, it kept me entertained.
58795|1|A very funny film
23858|1|Inspiring, intense tale about hardship, bigotry, redemption.
2256|1|Mehta explores the politics of religion to highlight how religious hypocrisy is used to ensure women are undermined and made subservient for economic purposes.
69952|1|Zany cave-age antics leaven too-serious plot.
81971|0|Weird, fatuous and tedious fantasy futuristic sci-fi cult film.
14226|0|The only moderately interesting scene here is a traditional Chinese wedding toward the end, which, of course, is cut short.
18712|1|Galaxy Quest works not just as a parody or a send-up of a type of film. It works as a basic space adventure as well.
13537|0|It's a pretty simple tale, but -- true to his Western influences -- Yamada slows down the action and stretches it out to a prize-winning length.
12308|1|The pleasant surprise about Demolition Man is that both the script, and Stallone, are funny; the film blends big-budget action and tongue-in-cheek humor in the way that Last Action Hero tried, and failed, to do.
12614|1|There's nothing particularly universal or relevant about this place- and sport-specific ode to American football. Although it's a gripping and watchable true story.
23390|1|Eric Eason's assured debut succeeds in the way Larry Clark's Kids succeeded -- through a feel for the rhythms of street life, and some extraordinary casting.
2259|1|It deals in genuinely funny situations, not just funny personalities.
32137|1|"An undeniably vivid, exceedingly well directed (by veteran Henry Hathaway) frontier tale that ""tells it like it was."""
378|1|Spielberg was wise to not rely entirely on computer images, rather blending the new technology with old-fashioned practical designs and the result is a film that looks far better than any modern tentpole blockbuster.
36242|1|...an affectionate look back on those golden years of live TV...a delightful little romp.
18044|0|Wahlberg isn't as confident or credible as a tough guy with a mantle of regret.
11004|1|In its neatest trick of all, the script circumvents any criticism of its lack of timeliness by very literally casting the proceedings under a shadow of death.
73576|0|Has its funny moments and is unquestionably a fine vehicle for John Hurt, but its lightweight predictability makes it hard to recommend.
43454|1|Dr Strangelove is one of Stanley Kubrick's many masterpieces, one of the greatest films about the Cold War and one of the greatest comedies ever made.
35153|0|Leon Ichaso's film soft-pedals everything save the language in what often resembles a made-for-cable biopic.
8871|0|Luedtke and Pollack bought these high-priced literary sources only to chuck them for a conventional, largely fictionalized movie romance.
9945|1|The Friedmans are a case study in family dysfunction.
46260|0|There are distinct signs of strain in the plot convolutions, not least in the spectator's loss of faith over indiscriminate and cheating use of hallucination; what certainly survives is Cronenberg's wholesale disgust with the world in general.
73086|0|Gallo's poor, poor pitiful me routine wears very thin, very fast, but Ricci is incandescent, a softly-glowing dumpling of a dream-girl in powder-blue fishnet tights and sparkly tap shoes.
7866|1|A deliriously trashy, exuberantly vulgar, lavishly appointed exploitation picture, this weird combo of road-kill movie and martial-arts vampire gorefest is made to order for the stimulation of teenage boys.
40756|1|...an effective and surprisingly funny teen comedy.
63969|1|A gritty, automobile-intensive, buddy flick rather reminiscent of director David Ayer's similarly amoral Training Day.
74864|0|The trailer looks like absolute garbage, but the movie itself was a lot less painful than I thought. It's still not good, just mediocre.
24523|1|To my surprise, I find myself recommending The Haunting on the basis of its locations, its sets, its art direction, its sound design, and the overall splendor of its visuals.
2786|0|[A] crass, trashy and none-too-funny comedy.
7448|0|Unfortunately, the outrageousness lessens in the second half of the film, becoming your straight forward underdog movie.
3054|1|Montgomery Clift's performance as upward-striving pauper George Eastman is a career peak, and Elizabeth Taylor is a gleaming paragon as his high-society paramour.
41780|1|Stirring story, indifferently realized.
17783|1|Maddin is a real film-maker with a confident, fluent movie language that is evolving in fascinating directions.
56790|1|It shows us Indy's origin and even ends with him riding off into the sunset after completing the ultimate quest of finding the Holy Grail. I mean how do you top that?

67374|0|"""well-intentioned but mostly bland"""
11418|1|Pootie Tang works, in part, because it doesn't. Which is to say the movie's special success is inextricable from the moments where it blatantly fails. The movie exerts a beguiling charm that can only be explained as the je ne sais quoi of sa da tay.

10669|1|The large cast is uniformly excellent and the film has been designed to stir the pot ... Unfortunately, audiences don't seem to be responding. Global warming is the hot button issue but our food supply and its contamination is just as important.
61131|1|Writer Cube and director Marcus Raboy vigorously mix Christmas cheer and and real life, and the result is as tasty as eggnog spiked with whiskey.
65245|1|The elegance, attention to detail, the invention and expertise all ensure that the movie's never less than visually breathtaking.
9031|1|Alfred Hitchcock's most abstract film (1963), and perhaps his subtlest, still yielding new meanings and inflections after a dozen or more viewings.
19602|1|It undoubtedly remains a genial crowd pleaser. If the dress fits, wear it.
11967|1|The bright, crisp design, Wilde's arch eloquence and a classy company help to camouflage the shortcomings.
8185|1|Notable not just for its earnestness and two outstanding performances (both won Oscars) -- it's also got one of the longest catfights in cinema history.
73808|1|Richard Brooks' screen version of Tennessee Williams' play is compromised (no mention of homosexuality), but it's well directed and deftly acted by Paul Newman and Liz Taylor, both at their sexiest.
68374|0|This is Bond by numbers: the fast cars, fast boats and fast women are all here, but there's little imagination at work.
69852|1|Overlit, staged like a high school play, but saved by the cast and Cole Porter songs
44649|1|Vibrant, visually exciting and emotionally resonant.
12476|1|It looks more magnificent and mad than ever, one of the great folies de grandeur of 1970s cinema, an expeditionary Conradian nightmare like Coppola's Apocalypse Now.
58310|1|Although Neil Marshall's attempt to justify the U.S. ending is admirable, the original ending is the only way out - providing a chilling bookend to a motif and suggesting what seems like cerulean-tinged peace is actually the solitary solace of madness.
30160|0|Some sort of mixed-up commentary on gentrification.
17254|1|Should be funnier, but not bad.
3467|1|Thoroughly enjoyable and involving, Kevin Costner's Open Range is a beautifully made western about flawed heroes who believe in redemption, loyalty and respect.
76692|1|The movie plays like an entry point into the infectious minds of ambitious overachievers, who do exactly what they want and offer no apologies.
13562|1|Gary Cooper gives a splendid, Oscar-nominated performance as lou Gehrig in Sam Wood's nostalgic but touching biopic of the Iron man, first baseman of the NY Yankess.
18454|1|..an undeniably messy movie that you nonetheless want to treasure just for its oddball existence.
53335|1|Delightful, athletic stuff with some unusual -- but wonderful -- location shooting. New York never looked better.
57771|0|This creepy satire is full of laughs and flaky twists, but by the end you may still be scratching your head.
53699|1|In this exhilarating, palm-moistening documentary by British filmmaker James Marsh (Wisconsin Death Trip), the twin towers are back to celebrate one of their finest moments.
59059|1|Its story's third-act inversions still provide a pointed rebuke to superhero narratives' set-in-stone dynamics.
3184|1|...thrums with a truly independent spirit and a dreamy ebullience.
12724|1|Cashback is light, smart, and enjoyable, and it makes me eager to see what Ellis has planned for his next outing.
13521|0|Aside from this lovely fa√ßade of racial harmony, your picture is really just another trite chick flick about sisterhood.
40137|0|The film may turn out to have been more of a stylistic adventure for the director than for an audience.
61227|1|A simple yet rich drama played with humour and compassion and blessed with excellent performances.
20140|0|Although I wouldn't quite go so far as to recommend it, the movie does have a terrific look and some intriguing, albeit overly dramatic, acting.
4308|1|A gorgeous and grotesque Korean film by director Kim Ki-Duk, who seems torn by his artistic and exploitive impulses.
19304|1|Notable, alas, for providing the last film score from veteran British film composer John Barry (1933-2011).
37660|1|Marvellous performances from Lemmon and Mills.
73656|1|[Washington] gives the kind of smooth, funny, laid-back performance that could help make him the first black matinee idol since Sidney Poitier.
56039|1|A more supernatural turn for the series.
70391|1|The film has everything a cult classic needs: eccentric plotting, weird characters (watch out for Gerrit Graham as Beef), bizarre costumes and a rocking soundtrack.
16448|1|"The primary conceit of ""Peeping Tom"" is to engage the audience as a voyeuristic accomplice to its anti-hero protagonist."
7443|1|Jane gives a terrific star-making performance.
3040|0|In the end, Tuck Everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived: too much to do, too little time to do it in.
31729|1|The film hurtles towards the final 'revelation moment' like runaway train. If only it had stopped to take on board some of Barker's heavy mythical dread.
73982|1|A deeply spiritual movie that honors the unfathomable mysteries of life.
80720|1|Debut writer-director Nimr√≥d Antal uses the anti-hero Bulcs√∫ (S√°ndor Cs√°nyi) as an effective symbol of repressed rebellion.
54559|0|Wears out its welcome long before it fizzles out.
21472|0|It has its moments, but it also has long, slow stretches where you feel like standing up and wandering around and maybe going out to hunt up a beer. That's fine for baseball, but it's not the way movies are supposed to work.
11166|1|Still Eastwood's best directorial effort for my money.
55677|0|Employing 3-D and PSE sound, then projected on a screen that suggests a small skyscraper, the new show at West Side Manhattan's Sony IMAX theater is, visually speaking, nothing but a clear day... but it definitely put me in scat-mode.
39689|1|Intelligent and highly thought-provoking.
81011|0|Perhaps the main problem with Friday After Next is that everything is too manic to be memorable.
45802|1|Mario Van Peebles's drugland feature, a relentless, hold-on-to-your-hat experience, rarely lets up.
40017|1|Ingmar Bergman's own little Tempest in a teapot... Hardly light material, but it's pretty frisky stuff for Bergman.
67011|0|Although Lounguine has a lot to say about Russia's struggle in its transition to global capitalism, his film is strangely uninvolving, lacking dramatic sweep.
32671|1|As good as some of the gags are, however, they might have fallen flat if performed by lesser talents.
14548|0|Bucatinsky has presented gay characters every bit as theatrically neurotic and precious as their straight counterparts.
11927|0|He's an old assassin, she's a young local dancing hottie, and they mix dance, lust and guns.
47992|1|As the movers and shakers of this peculiar saga, Bonnaire and Huppert are unnerving and fascinating to watch together.
56550|1|Gordon's saving grace is that the stop-motion animation and model work on Robot Jox looks really cool, even now.
65621|1|First Day in October puts up front the precise comic timing of Walter Matthau as an outspoken liberal justice of the Supreme Court.
72381|0|There's so little to watch besides Carrey, in fact, it makes you actually miss (gasp!) Sean Young from Ace 1.
47698|0|Skimps on character development for such a politically-charged movie
7673|1|Boiler Room grips you early, with its fascinating insights and Younger's appropriation of hip hop music and his snappy, jump-cut-y visual style, and it hardly ever let go.
80700|0|... has more respect for the intelligence of the title dog than its audience.
8284|1|Mr. Lang can direct a film. He has put his mind to it, in this instance, and he has brought forth a hot one with a sting.
70170|1|David O. Russell's gleefully subversive family saga offers a twisted coming of age tale that begins realistically before pushing its characters over rhe edge into lunacy.
21997|1|The film lives up to its hype.
3143|0|I haven't seen such self-amused trash since Freddy Got Fingered.
55397|0|Period costume dramas are always expected to offer opulent pageantry, but in the case of Vatel, that's all there is.
989|1|Until it goes off the rails in its final 10 or 15 minutes, Wendigo, Larry Fessenden's spooky new thriller, is a refreshingly smart and newfangled variation on several themes derived from far less sophisticated and knowing horror films.
44887|1|A throwback to the days when such movies as 'A Man for All Seasons' tackled big religious ideas in the context of significant historical events...
78009|1|Too-cute with a few iffy moments, but tweens will eat it up.
74822|0|Unnecessary '90s remake has iffy humor, stereotypes.
536|1|Great first half, boring second half.
63730|0|Portman and the audience are stranded in the middle, on the outside looking in, with nothing to do and patience increasingly wearing thin.
7675|1|Underrated ...
45475|1|A great deal more complex than it has any right or reason to be.
63898|1|When [Lynch is] on track, though, the film shines with a gaudy beauty.
7948|1|So much is right about Beowulf that one longs for the darker, grimier version that might have been in live action.
22242|0|An arbitrary by-the-numbers courtroom/crime yarn that sometimes shifts between being too preachy and pretentious.
37376|1|It's a familiar show-biz routine but one that's spangled with happy surprises and sharp acting.
30140|1|It doesn't matter if you're a news junkie or clueless about current events, you need to see this movie.
36759|0|Part thriller, part love story and part political allegory, told as dream noir, but too tangled and slippery to inspire much empathy.
60561|1|This noir spoof is hammy pulp fiction to be sure, but the oddball characters and truly hilarious banter pull it right out of the B-grade bin and onto the cult shelf.
37412|1|Flaherty's narrative may seem slightly naive; but his vision of a child's myth-world, and the oilmen's intrusion and acceptance into it, is perhaps his greatest achievement.
88|1|Beyond its contagious, wacky humour, the film has a very sweet heart
50800|1|There's a resonance to Sophie Scholl that crosses borders and approaches the timeless.
44007|0|When Nichols finally settles down, it's almost too late.
78614|0|Robin Williams and Billy Crystal can each provoke a lot more laughs in a minute of standup than they jointly manage during the entire running time of Fathers' Day.
50686|1|It may have seemed like a movie that was out of time, but it turned out to be perfectly in sync with the restlessness of the early 90s as well.
13381|0|These bad-boy auteurs will have to discover some new ideas if they don't want to end up as terminally soulless as the monsters who stalk their movie.
17360|1|Ready for a timely political comedy with Gene Hackman?
9914|0|Murky, disturbing stuff that most of the time does better at repelling viewers than compelling them to stick around to see what happens next.
11221|0|There are the makings of a great comedy here, but you will not find more than scattered hints of it.
30574|0|Many scenes from the previews aren't in the film -- a telltale sign of desperate last-minute tampering.
4832|1|Production-wise, the film is pretty slick with large budget F/X helping the upscale television production.
3773|1|Show me a director better suited for a movie about magic than Christopher Nolan and I'll show you... a magician?
12917|0|It's slapped together childishly and has no real foundation to render it even vaguely capable of withstanding a lapping wave of intellect or logic.
38205|0|Represents a peculiarly dated male fantasy.
12816|1|Out for Justice harbors an incredibly simple vengeance plot loaded with enough macho sadism to satiate the action genre's bloodthirsty fans.
66082|1|Gruesome and incredibly exploitative. However, for better or for worse, I Spit on Your Grave shows us the raw, shocking reality of rape, in all its bloody viciousness.
30074|0|Might have worked a little better on stage, and with a few different actors.
37772|0|If you think Eddie Murphy lost his mojo about 20 years ago and has been lacking clear comedic judgment ever since, then you've got to see this for confirmation. Or maybe not.
5989|1|The effect is stingingly poignant.
19214|1|Premium Van Damme...Henstridge is eye-poppingly appealing
75953|1|Muni overacts, Rains saves the day
44917|1|Displaying an uncharacteristic even-handedness for Hollywood, this Japanese-American production is certainly the epic equal of Pearl Harbor, while consistently maintaining an almost unimpeachable honesty with its dual perspectives.
68126|1|A terrific attempt to express a young boy's moral awakening using intense colour schemes, wide-angle lenses and unforgiving close-ups
825|1|Like all of Ozu's work, it's incredibly human, and that can be a rarity in the artificial world of the cinema.
15035|1|This is really just innocent material with a tendency to flout basic guidelines and stray from the perimeters of believability.
35425|1|The hook of the film is that it presents the ragtag Borchardt, a cantankerous, often disagreeable sort with the kind of freshness missing from most documentaries.
69822|1|Uses Middle Eastern stereotypes only to question what could be accomplished by foolishly sending Americans into a world we don't comprehend.
21073|0|A flat affair, and one I won't have a hard time forgetting.
78489|0|Mystery Science Theater could have a field-day with this!
9835|1|An expertly blended mix of live music and real sex.
6641|0|Children under 13 are the only ones who should, theoretically, find this alleged comedy funny.
7622|1|[D]eliciously old-fashioned... Like in how Dahl assembled a cast of perfectly 1940s faces that pop off the screen with a suave anti-Technicolor urgency...
19043|1|Most splash-color, outrageous soap ever; Tierney is fabulous
79248|0|Although it does a bang-up job of showcasing Tilly's breasts and some over-the-top gore sequences, this ultracampy entry fails to produce much in the way of chills, thrills, or chuckles.
11698|0|Despite a handful of great jokes, this is ultimately disappointing - it's badly plotted, badly acted and occasionally downright embarrassing.
72563|0|When toddlers are tipping the punchlines, it's time for rewrite.
5502|1|Still holds up as a creepy and atmospheric gem...
17261|1|Martyrs is an absolute recommend, but only to those who are willing to accept the film on its own uncompromising terms. All others are advised to stay well clear away.
63506|0|Utterly stupid and full of lazy plotting and lazier dialogue, this is just idiotic enough to entertain on nights when you want to give your brain a rest.
7329|0|Duffy has made a film that sort of straddles the fine line between great movie and useless piece of garbage.
10456|0|The strain of messianism in Will Smith movies is becoming ever more pronounced.
68426|0|Unfocused, overly dramatic, and all over the map; the ostensible subject deserves a much better treatment.
48985|1|It's a must-see for anyone, be they a fan of the grand old American pastime, or simply someone who likes being told a real classic human tale.
61222|1|Eye-opening docu on corporate power is timely, provocative.
42571|0|Has more embarrassing moments than good ones.
78252|1|Murray hasn't made a comedy this winningly dumb and smart and -- yes -- sweet in a long time. If, indeed, he ever has.
13566|1|As a forum for its actors and for the big-screen directorial debut of multi-Emmy winner Gregory Hoblit, the film is up to the job.
77587|1|Moving, memorable, great Warner Bros. biography of WWI hero York, with fine Cooper performance--an Oscar winner.
46648|0|An artistic and commercial misstep, this b/w tribute to German Expressionism wastes the talents of Jodie Foster, Lily Tomlin, Kathy Bates, and many others.
53296|0|extremely outdated
42750|1|Slightly overlong for overseas audiences, Jos√© Padilha's film (co-directed by editor Felipe Lacerda) makes it crystal clear why this incident proved so traumatic for many Brazilians.
79633|0|Redundant and more than a little wearisome.
20999|0|After the conceptually madcap and sophisticated The Impostors, one expects better.
53463|0|...takes an enduring monster-movie premise, starts to rework it promisingly, and then drops the ball and falls back on trite, stereotyped action until we finally stop caring.
24869|1|one of Allen's best, a must-see!
25394|1|The film's high spirits are contagious and wholly impossible to resist.
29571|0|Maybe the studio brass thought it would be hit; viewed now, it looks like a desperate reach, a blind attempt to do anything to connect with the audience.
46386|0|Writer-director Zalman King's Wild Orchid could be considered the Fifty Shades of Grey of its day: a would-be erotic romp that ultimately carries as much of a sexual charge as a Chicken McNugget.
77577|1|Lewis is terrific!
4052|1|A marvelous movie, with Bill Murray scoring again in the realm of drama.
10078|1|"Arquette gives the kind of mighty physical performance usually delivered by men in existential action classics like ""The Wages of Fear,"" but she suffuses it with something all her own-she's bulletproof yet vulnerable."
50232|1|It's about time Warner Bros. revived Bugs. He was the most irreverent, intelligent, sophisticated and appealing cartoon character ever to defy gravity.
24228|1|Works as every bit the disposable jolt dispenser it's assembled to be.
16100|0|The 70-year-old Godard has become, to judge from In Praise of Love, the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them.
39924|1|Instead of sitting in the shadow of the original Godfather, the Godfather Part II added to to the epic and made it even greater.
11671|1|I liked it; you may not. It may come down to your level of fascination with people who scream and gesture wildly in melodramatic Italian.
68894|1|Deserves national attention.
38420|1|Thought-provoking film not for tweens/young teens.
9765|1|Terrific Woody Allen thrill comedy with the great Keaton co-starring as a plus.
37291|0|All the performers either overact laughably or underact to the point of just standing in place and speaking lines in a monotone.
27663|1|Classic cop film with frequent profanity, violence.
68791|1|Jumpy and ironic, Downey is a quicksilver delight and Kilmer is funny as the gay Perry.
30635|1|First Potter movie is a magical ride but also intense.
26719|1|Creepy and mysterious as The Usual Suspects, unseen forces and cryptic messages pit men against themselves in one of the darkest and best action-thrillers of the year.
16086|1|Mr. Gabin was no stranger to playing doomed men on film, and his P√©p√© is the grandest of the damned.
55290|0|Beresford draws the best from a fine cast. Only when he tries to up the thrill quotient near the end are the contrivances of Akiva Goldsman's debut script revealed, like cracks in the smooth surface of a frozen lake.
42842|0|It's glossy, charming, silly, and far too self-aware to be at all thrilling.
51623|1|Howard Hawks's darkest comedy (1949) -- a loosely constructed, episodic film that traces the progressive humiliations suffered by Free French army captain Cary Grant.
77965|1|... a haunting portrait of an artist walking on the edge, that shows his pain in a very real way.
44071|0|Can't decide whether it wants to be dark or merry, and it bungles nearly every attempt at doing either.
7777|0|A routine mob thriller.
74303|1|...most of the time the film succeeds only in emphasizing the distance between the characters on the screen and the people watching them in the theater.
72761|1|Charming and harmless. Nap while your kid enjoys.
61211|1|This is arguably Elvis Presley's best film, and certainly his best acting performance.
11311|0|More an imitation than a parody, this would-be comedy is very short on laughs and gives away virtually all of them in its coming-attractions trailer.
7405|1|"It's entertaining and at times even insightful, but nowhere near as powerful-or memorable-as ""The Hustler."""
26630|0|You'll feel like you're an unwilling passenger along for a bumpy trip in John Dahl's road rage thriller Joy Ride -- Dahl dresses up this fuel-injected spectacle with silly-minded edge-of-your-seat fury
49622|1|Not One Less is a multi-layered story. It has a strong investment in culture and politics, but it is also a delightful story.
55655|0|The Curse of the Recycled TV Series strikes again as director Barry Sonnenfeld manages to transform a mildly amusing mid-'60s TV show into a bloated big-screen bore.

37806|1|A juicy exploration of women's roles in the 21st century -- at work, at home and in the bedroom and although men figure in the storyline (natch), it is women-only who grace the screen. Three generations of them.
6977|0|Dimwitted, obvious, subpar in every way.
71628|1|The comic has been condensed into a sweet-naturedly nutty motion picture with the buoyancy of a clutch of colored balloons.
10517|1|Gruesome but somewhat intelligent supernatural thriller.
10443|1|Even though the thing doesn't begin to make its presence felt till near the halfway point... the simple act of watching men discuss strategy ends up being terrifically absorbing.
77866|0|an extremely pretty movie to look at and listen to, but although Irving's basic plot remains, the richness of his prose hasn't truly transferred to the screen.
28281|1|Yes, Miracle On 34th Street is pure Hollywood hokum... But the film is pretty savvy too, getting a jump on mounting anxieties about the post-war cult of consumerism.
43045|0|While the depiction of the Lapa district and the details of repressed homosexual life in Rio 10 years ago is always intriguing, we come away learning very little about the individual known as Madame Sat√£.
62543|1|Sweet and charmingly funny in many places, this is dated but entertaining.
79401|0|In the first half of Director John McTiernan's movie, Willis wears an undershirt. In the second half he gets rid of it. And that's pretty much it for his performance.
39884|1|Talky, but not surprising, since it is based on Hemingway story of old man (Tracy) musing about catching huge fish.
58830|0|Ah, the charm, inquisitiveness and imagination of pre-pubescent adolescence, as seen by a Hollywood screenwriter.
50006|1|Americans...will find Zellweger's newly acquired English accent believable enough to enjoy her comic performance.
14779|0|Nothing about the plot has any real spark, besides the gimmicky set-up.
2466|0|With recent tensions rekindled by the Kathleen Soliah trial and the upcoming trial of SLA members Emily and William Harris, not to mention Sept. 11, its difficult these days to appreciate Fire's bright side.
40849|0|Even without that lumpy subplot, Blue Sky is wildly uneven and is virtually held together most of the way by the performances of its stars.
10007|1|Deeply affecting in the moment, but I'm not sure that Garbus draws much in the way of larger conclusions.
19215|1|This film offers just about everything, including a twenty-minute white-knuckle sequence and a chance to shed a few tears. In short, it's first-rate entertainment.
43594|1|The overall effect is not so unlike Mameha's description of geisha themselves: a moving work of art.
53022|0|Its heart is surely in the right place. Yet so much of it just doesn't work...that it's hard to get very excited about it.
61763|0|While military man turned director Ayer implicates our culture steeped in violence and the damaging effects of trained killing, whether by police or in war, he's assembled such a deplorable LAPD rogues gallery, it's hard to tell which one is the worst.
63603|1|Lassie Come Home gives the screen's first dog star, Rin-Tin-Tin, a run for his money, mostly thanks to its rich Technicolor cinematography and its top-shelf cast.
31418|1|It acknowledges war as a fact, but embraces pacifism.
56135|0|The sentiments are right on the money, but the execution never quite filled me with holiday cheer.
79933|1|Enormously entertaining!
6132|0|The film is rescued by a strong third act, but getting there is torture.
66826|1|"Amusing as this may be, there's something a bit studious about ""Body Heat."" Kasdan's ceiling fans and Venetian blinds often come across as film school affectations."
5056|0|"""Grandma's Boy"" is a pot- and potty-mouthed relative of an Adam Sandler movie."
72163|1|A must-see not only for fans of Shakur's music but for anyone who appreciates a well-told life story.
72572|1|This film has madness running all the way through it, a madness that seeps from story into reality and back again.
55694|1|Louis Malle's supremely stylish New Wave thriller combines Miles Davis's music, Henri Decae's wonderfully evocative black-and-white cinematography of Paris and plenty of close-ups of a young Jeanne Moreau looking very anguished.

46428|1|Because it is sublime, and because the confrontation of many of Pasolini's films can be an intimidation, it is among the controversial director's best films.
65703|0|This portentous chiller is a nasty piece of work.
20080|1|A stunning futuristic thriller about cloning and immortality, The Island combines spectacle with controversy.

19937|0|Truthfully, it isn't as bad as its reputation, registering less as an out-and-out disaster and more as a missed opportunity.

61727|1|Spectacle galore starring Hepburn and Fonda.
49596|0|Everyone seems to be trying gamely here, but the writing thwarts at every turn.
15088|0|A sequel, a costume fantasy, a romantic melodrama, a CGI war spectacular, a puzzling celebration of beauty over substance.
18355|0|So simple, so broad are White Man's Burden's paint strokes ... that no real lesson outside of the obviously mundane can be elicited, and that's a real shame.
11414|0|In this very short film ... so much comic relief feels like desperate attempts to pad an already skimpy story.

17771|0|We get five minutes of halfway-decent action that hardly makes up for the other 90 minutes of this lukewarm diarreah-fest.
11525|0|Too often the uneven script is either hopelessly strained or tediously lackadaisical.
13408|1|Herzog creates a magnificent-looking, hauntingly strange film that, at points, has the same mesmerising effect as that experienced by the cast.

3235|1|This may not be a great movie, but I still couldn't help falling in love with it.
19973|1|The special effects are a real treat, the love-beyond-the-grave theme is very touching and the ending is a wonderful piece of schmaltz.
6547|0|It's filled out with a shoddy, animated wraparound sequence and it's all dropped in the hands of an inexperienced director, Michael Cornick.
19543|1|It was wise to wait two years to release this collection of 11 shorts, each 11 minutes, nine seconds and one frame in length; even now, it's hard to imagine the viewer whose gut will remain unwrenched.

1381|0|It's an obsessed film that is too murky to be great cinema, but interesting enough to remain intriguing.
21691|1|It's an astringently cynical take on official history, with Warren Beatty as a muckraker investigating the strange aftershocks of a senator's killing.
7091|1|Somehow, the movie taps into the book's uncanny implication that the very air is charged with malevolent ancient spirits...
31503|1|Laborious, but beautifully crafted 193 minute opus from the master of epic cinema, David Lean.

64021|1|A mildly satisfying high-energy romp complete with outstanding professional hockey footage and intense physical confrontations.
32419|1|One of the strangest and wildest cult flicks to be ever financed by a major studio (Fox), this sequel has not aged well but it serves as a time capsule to its era.
1537|1|Holes is a rarity among kids' movies: It's dark, complex, intelligent and well-acted.

9205|1|This is moving stuff, thoughtfully handled and well performed.
16073|1|One of the most moving, enjoyable and wholly unconventional Christmas stories to come along in a long time.
75997|1|The sex is intended to arouse, the violence to excite, and the combination enables Faster Pussycat's status as an absolute masterpiece of subversion.
18531|1|Underrated look at the horrors of drug addiction. James Woods, as always, is terrific.
30182|1|It has been very well made, with the often jumpy photography and scuzzy locales that reflect the nervous energy and predatory nature of its young subject. But it also finds the time to achieve some real emotional depth.
7571|0|The film is not racist, but it stupidly regurgitates the old myth of happy, singing slaves who just love working on massah's plantation.
20493|1|Shyamalan has a way to go before ascending to the level of Alfred Hitchcock, the uncontested master of psychological suspense, but he clearly wants to do so.

69990|1|Schultze's quiet determination in his musical quest gives the film an unexpected emotional punch.
7896|1|A paean to the loveable losers in show biz who give it all they've got but still cup up short.
39967|0|The plot is convoluted, the characters are silly and the ancient jokes, puns and sight gags are so low they make the Three Stooges seem sophisticated.
30689|0|Kind of Hoosiers: Part 2. But the storytelling is so backassward that it's impossible to care about any of the characters or really engage in the movie whatsoever.
9908|1|As Fame begins to unspool and you realize that the movie's a lot more endearingly grimy and profane than you recall...just blame it on that stupid TV knockoff.

31225|1|An idiot is exactly what you'll be if you don't check out The Dinner Game.
81250|0|"I hate to use the phrase, ""they're only in it for the money,"" but if any sequel ever exemplified that ethos, it's this one. Ultimately, Rush Hour 3 is a one trick pony whose day has long since passed."
21825|0|Almost stunning in its determination to be the ultimate wish-fulfillment fantasy vehicle for plus-sized African-American women...
39644|1|A great big wallow, sublime hootchy-kootchy hokum, peppered with lightning that does automatic writing and an unsurpassed homage to the joys of jello.

44128|0|Not much to take away from this world-weary melodrama except for a lot of gloom.
1813|1|One of the best horror SEQUELS ever made.
27067|1|Leigh's film is an exquisite and, yes, successful celebration of human creativity.
6331|1|...about the dead-end despair of ghetto life, where the false independence of a criminal enterprise is really just another form of enslavement.
74321|1|One of the sharpest male-oriented comedies of the 1990s.
26868|0|A Single Girl delivers 80 unbroken and ultimately irritating minutes in the life of a pretty hotel waitress (Virginie Ledoyen).
18636|1|Serves as an intense drama, an intelligent thriller, and an intriguing character study wrapped into a solidly constructed package.
8976|0|It is a limp, lifeless story starring Greg Kinnear as a con man who becomes a do-gooder, and one of its many problems is that he was a lot more entertaining as a con man.
19680|1|Liam Aiken is the heart of this movie; the fantastic voice casting and animal training is the machine. Both serve their purposes well.
27241|1|Deliberately disgusting, scatological, profane and vulgar, which makes this critic a bit embarrassed to admit that he found himself frequently laughing out loud at such offensive and obscene material.
17119|1|Dark, probing, and truly disturbing, Seidl's astonishing feature debut explores angst, anomie, and alientaion in Vienna's upscale suburbs in visually audacious mode that goes beyond Todd Solondz and Todd Haynes.
68119|0|...politics aside, the film is simply overlong and boring, which are among the greatest sins any movie can commit.
2535|1|Written and directed by Gus Van Sant, who mingles tremendous visual imagination with a leaning toward off-the-wall situations and sometimes raunchy images.
68465|1|Brittle and rough; full of excellent performances, too.
13526|1|Excellent introduction to Buddhism--strongest portions are mythical excerpts of Buddha's life.
3488|1|The Legend of Zorro is a campier sequel, occasionally given too much to childish antics. But once the story really kicks in, it transforms into a fine adventure film and a worthy addition to the Zorro film legacy.
30313|1|It maps these dark, desperate, fearful times with comic and terrifying veracity, and holds out a glimmer of hope for the soul-searching survivors of the '90s.
26806|1|Racist yet an incredibly important landmark film.
81281|1|The football scenes are involving, the acting is up to snuff, and there is something about those last days of high school that remains a solid background for even the most familiar of stories.
55249|1|Riveting, downbeat, and surprising, a gripping adventure and one of Hollywood's most resonant morality tales¬Ö a smart, remorseless story of gold, greed, guns, and guile.
22021|1|It's actually Maddin's most accessible film, and underneath the surreal images and foreboding narration is a relatively familiar message: You can go home again. And if you do, feel free to take some creative liberties here and there.
19202|0|Rarely do movies try-and fail-as hard to be cool as Hackers.
19817|0|This is fairy tale stuff, its saintly hip-hop heroine far too worthy for comfort and its dialogue hilariously banal.
79473|1|The premise was so good that I expected the frantic pic to be funnier and not so overwrought.
12930|0|You feel insulted you're expected to care about the petty problems of the leads when other characters are dealing with child murder, political torture and genocide.
50717|1|Wants to be the next-generation Princess Bride, and, boy, does it come close.
22198|1|A herd of witty, clever and delightfully sick claymation shorts.
56042|0|For all of the apparent naturalness on screen, Guediguian's grim vision comes off as far too calculated.
67751|0|Separate Lies seems to take forever to unfold, and when it does, it makes one wonder if it was worth the trouble.
66405|0|Ranks a 'one' next to Spinal Tap's '11'.
73942|1|A fantastic movie, featuring two of the finest motion picture performers ever, Astaire and Judy Garland, in their only cinematic pairing. Ann Miller also stars in there, too, to spice things up even more.
67245|0|Despite many charming elements, this movie is not an example of good storytelling.
28065|1|The result is uncommonly pleasing or defiantly twee: take your choice.
15460|1|Small-town drama has big moments thanks to Johnny Depp, Juliette Lewis and a superb Leonardo DiCaprio.
53820|1|"One of the great ""bad"" movies of the decade."
64558|1|Hunger is tough going -- and compelling cinema throughout.
19688|1|An impressive and enduring evocation of time and place, this is a moving low-life drama built around Oscar-winning writing and performances.

8163|1|...everything a good, taut, riveting conspiracy movie should be.
81457|1|... a winning combo that could herald a new lease of life for this surprisingly resilient franchise ...
17037|1|Blow Out is not known as one of Brian De Palma's horror movies, but of all his films, it's the one that feels most like a nightmare.
69553|0|A sappy melodrama touted in a supernatural angle...
15128|0|After I swallowed my disbelief and gave my critical faculties a break, yeah, I was tickled every 40 minutes or so.
18587|1|Minor but delightful Sturges comedy.
15579|0|Though pleasing to the eye, it's not everything we would have hoped for from Kieslowski.
38068|1|More hits then misses in this collection of skits. To my knowledge, the Loch Ness Monster is still on the loose.
12607|1|[Tony] Jaa has an impressive physique, a steel snap to his delivery, and a gymnastic prowess to his style, and director Prachya Pinkaew puts it all on display in an endearingly na√Øve martial arts adventure.
28560|0|The story comes from a million other movies (mainly Jaws and Alien), and it's completely and totally predictable.
23389|1|In its metaphysical concerns and challenging notions about personal and social responsibility, the film aims much higher than most American youth pictures.
8006|0|A grueling experience.
52006|1|An antidote to forced holiday cheer, this scabrously funny misanthropic comedy is not for the whole family.
40097|1|Few films noir were better than this.
31996|1|There are a lot of sacred entertainment industry cows being sent to the slaughter, and Stiller & co. skewer every stereotype with vicious glee.
58794|0|Thin, monotonous
48792|1|Cat People is a good movie in an old tradition, a fantasy-horror film that takes itself just seriously enough to work, has just enough fun to be entertaining, [and] contains elements of intrinsic fascination in its magnificent black leopards.
24045|1|Mr. & Mrs. Smith works on almost every level and against all odds.
70000|1|It understands that not everyone falls into love through the avenue of physical desire; that for some, the lust may be for another's mind, for inner beauty.
68196|0|The lethargic script could benefit from its heroine's singularity of purpose.
360|1|If Grosse Pointe Blank (1997) was just another comedy in the wave of 80s nostalgia, then John Cusack is the kid who grew up to be Oliver North.
37202|0|A werewolf movie so bad it merits a silver bullet.
50447|1|Don Siegel's taut, bleak, noir-flavoured picture is arguably the science-fiction B-movie of the 1950s, an age when screens glowed with the atomic threat and undulated with scuttling, supersized bugs.
63039|0|This vulgar film, replete with vile language and graphic descriptions of sex acts, degrades our culture. Even George Carlin might find it offensive.
45132|1|Some funny moments, but for adults only.
12356|1|A memorable exercise in the paranoia genre.
28293|1|Yentl is all about, who else? Miss Streisand. But her vast talents turn a gender-bending fable into a winner.
46808|1|May be the unappreciated middle child of the Trek franchise, but it's still one of better and more indispensable episodes.
3815|1|[A] difficult and heart-wrenching story of justice perverted.
24527|1|The segment in which Nick (Steve Buscemi) attempts to film a dream sequence (not unlike the famous one from TV's Twin Peaks) featuring a dwarf named Tito (Peter Dinklage) is worth the rental/purchase price alone.
55035|1|The story is a cynical twist on Lang's famous M.
13514|1|A stunning demonstration of moral and existential suspense in relation to duration, much like Agnes Varda's 1961 Cleo From 5 to 7.
16973|0|Bad movie. Bad career move. Bad in all respects.
70508|1|A kind of splendid mishmash of crude history, action-movie cliches and stunning photography, editing and fight choreography.
25859|0|I'm surprised not only that there wasn't a lawsuit over the film, but also by how watchable the film is (though it truly is bad, it's fun at least).
36670|1|Lynch has no intention of trying to ¬ìexplain¬î what makes Alvin tick or of understanding him in any reductionistic way; of reducing a man to a motivation.
863|0|The modern sequences lack realism or credibility. The ancient sequences play like the equivalent of a devout Bible story.
26050|0|I hope what they all got paid made it worth the bother.
47413|1|Cher, in a role ideally suited to her natural flamboyance, sparkles.
58021|0|"For all of ""Dogville's"" strengths -- its powerful performances, the ingenious staging, how quickly and completely the audience accepts its stylized reality -- its take-home message is, ultimately, measly."
52727|0|Too much of what is good about the original The Vanishing has been eviscerated. If you want quality, see the Dutch version; this one is a pale imitation.
4586|1|The brilliance of the film, is in its simplicity.
15547|0|hopelessly sub-standard feel-good fare
47169|1|As the timid professor and burlesque stripper, Cooper and Stanwyck are at the top of their form in Hawks' delectable screwball comedy, based on a witty script from Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett.

43916|0|It seems to please the Baby Boomer generation, but it didn't please me.
36423|0|"Critters as a franchise has nothing on the Nightmare on Elm Street films, but it's proven popular enough with Gen X-ers who forward ""You know you're a child of the '80s if..."" emails to all their office mates."
53726|0|Without much point at all.
14587|1|I will not deny that it left me with a very nice feeling throughout.
79297|0|Hilary O'Neil is poor but healthy, uneducated but full of spunky common sense. Victor Geddes is rich but mortally ill, overeducated and understandably fearful and withdrawn. In other words, they are made for each other.
76397|1|"Director Ken Loach borrows the title of his 1920s Irish insurrection drama ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"" from a Robert Dwyer Joyce poem, and, in turn, his film is visual poetry."
22645|1|The plot is a bundle of confusions, but who cares? Few films have made cigarettes seem so glamorous. Or had such seductive repartee.
43397|1|Classic comedy-western gem, with fantastic performances from Garner and the supporting cast. Not quite as good as SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL GUNFIGHTER, though.
43054|1|A cruise on the Yangtze, site of the Three Gorges Dam (the largest hydroelectric project in the world) is a fitting metaphor for the promise and cost of China's rapid modernization.
34098|1|Searing story of betrayal isn't for kids.
47718|1|A film that remains one of the most powerful screen comments on the horrors of war.
64914|1|When a group of actors this gifted and lively tries so good-naturedly to deliver such an obvious message, the audience is left in the position of trying to stop a tidal wave. You may hate yourself for responding, but you're smothered before you know it.
17399|0|A wretchedly sub-standard score from Jacques Morali and production numbers of exceptional tackiness round things off.
76325|1|White Heat is vigorous and uncompromising. Cagney is all kinetic energy and raw nerve.
25880|0|A bunch of nasty kill scenes in search of a plot (and scares).
71045|1|The final shoot-out remains a classic study in mise-en-scene, as Mann transforms a jagged landscape into a highly charged psychological battleground.
2859|1|Problem is it hammers home its point about racism being alive and well in America until it becomes annoyingly repetitive and preachy.
62507|0|In all, about a third of the film (most of it contained in three extended sequences) is audaciously funny and genuinely disturbing. The rest will sorely test the devotion of Carrey's fans.
3205|0|Paul Newman's charismatic performance elevates this hodgepodge of a picture, but it is not enough.
76713|1|I'm sure all the Monster Squad enthusiasts will be absolutely thrilled with the package Lionsgate has put together here.
20795|1|It's like one long sketch that never seems to rocket off into the inspired heights of lunacy the series maintained so well.
60224|1|Above average depiction of infamous WWII battleship Bismark.
23737|1|It's bizarre, wild, entertaining and deliciously dark. Death to Smoochy is a splendid parody as Danny DeVito revels in the darkness of the project and Robin Williams excels at the wild swings of madness the role demands. At times melodramatic, but always
27373|1|Never patronising his characters, Ang Lee combines comedy, both subtle and raucous, with acute social asides.
51804|1|A visually and spiritually rewarding documentary.
7003|1|The skill of Hare's approach is that he initially allows us to assume, via normal cinema techniques, that what we saw of the dinner party was the whole story.
43832|1|Brilliant. Mike Figgis has shown us the future of digital technology. It shall be glorious.
12563|0|By the end of the film, relationships have turned so corrosive that the characters leave an ugly aftertaste in the mind of the viewer.
13196|1|Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing.
40647|0|Languid at times and poorly paced.
3942|1|"""belongs on the stage, but for what it is, not bad"""
16992|1|Brave, yes, but undeniably excessive.
66183|1|This is one of those rare creatures, the work of a master craftsman in full control of his craft.
70467|1|"One of the more admirable ""Apes"" sequels, warts and all."
53132|1|Across landscapes from sunny South Florida to snowy Detroit, George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez deliver a sizzling, palpable heat in Out of Sight.
27394|1|This powerful, heartfelt and important drama from one of the great names in world cinema deserves to be seen.
16803|1|Grippingly horrible.

32470|1|Kinetic direction, crisp black and white photography, pop music, urban realism, social issues, and contemporary attitudes towards sex
6560|1|First-time director Eric Eason's assured debut feature is a gritty urban drama shot on a shaky handheld DV camera for $25,000.
9537|0|The content is memorable, but for its stupidity and pointlessness rather than intelligence and attitude.
4146|1|one of Elvis' most compelling works, despite a forced, artificial ending.
7752|1|Streep gives the most fully articulated comic performance of her career, the one she's always hinted at and made us hope for.
12115|1|Remarkable chemistry between the impossibly glamorous pair of Pfeiffer and Clooney.
15781|0|Don't be duped by the steamy-sounding premise, for this dud manages to turn the prospect of swinging into a dull and decidedly antiseptic affair.
13994|1|What stays fresh (and enhanced by the beautifully restored black- and-white print) is how so many of Fellini's gifts and obsessions are already apparent in this early work.
15514|1|The movie is lightweight, as it should be. It doesn't get all supercharged. Ben and Sharon, despite setbacks, are delighted to be admired by such wonderful partners, and we are happy for them.
24173|0|The writers have created cardboard cutouts instead of flesh-and-blood characters.
12926|1|Sure it's all precious and Hallmark-y, but Cocoon is still good, heartwarming fun.
62929|1|Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang is both an apology for soiling American cinema and surrender to the mass appeal that allowed it to happen. It's a bold experiment, yet only occasionally a great movie.
71247|0|...a dull, thoroughly unpleasant horror flick...
57617|0|Will Smith's previous film with director Gabriele Muccino, The Pursuit of Happyness, was a tale well told. Their new one is a gimmicky tale annoyingly told.
52770|1|Absorbing until it crashes in a tiresome manner trying to be too inexplicably symbolic.

29598|1|Frequently uproarious.
65322|0|Much of the action in the movie involves picking up dog feces, an apt metaphor for this astoundingly witless film.
76279|1|Until it backs itself into a narrative corner, Lisa Krueger's Committed. is a delightfully unpredictable experience.
1287|1|My Wife Is an Actress is an utterly charming French comedy that feels so American in sensibility and style it's virtually its own Hollywood remake.
13443|1|Considered by many as one of the key Spanish films of the Seventies.
80248|0|Carlson is willing to overlook and forgive all of the craziness and even criminalities that find a home in Massillon.
10588|1|It's devastating.
11865|0|The same pointless exercise in violence and pseudo-mystical twaddle that the whole series has represented since 1986.
48945|0|Despite some performance moments to savor, the film can't pay tribute to Cassavetes Sr. without disclosing its own vast inferiority.

1046|0|Action is relatively mild for the genre and, unfortunately, so are the jokes.
67635|1|A slightly erotic and decidedly offbeat movie, Beyond the Clouds has a strong attraction that is hard to put into words. A frustrating film, it is simultaneously bizarrely fascinating and soporifically unsatisfying.
6049|1|Repo! lingers long after it ends, due in great part to a handful of memorable tunes and its persistent funky attitude, marked by an impressive desire to savor oddity and unconventional displays of heartache.
2518|1|A series of strenuously oddball vignettes masquerading as a movie.
22352|1|A gritty and darkly disturbing thriller about cops and thugs.
6707|0|The picture as a whole is marred by inexpert camera technique, film editing whose incorrectness hits one between the eyes, and strangely uneven sound recording.
18181|0|Just a parade of scattershot gags, more often weird than funny and most often just flat.
2213|1|There's nothing quite as devastating as tragedy treated with sharp and precise Northern European restraint.
34404|0|A disappointing marriage of science fiction and action, with too much sci-fi nonsense and not nearly enough action.
25121|1|[A] dispiriting expose of predatory lending scams that mislead even smart, educated people and a credit-card industry that is designed... to work against the ordinary consumer...
11279|1|This is a good example of Hollywood commercial calculation that actually pays off with a few entertainment dividends. It all seems very cold and calculated, and yet the film still turns out to be decently entertaining.
10326|0|Glacial pacing and a series of highly unlikely plot contrivances manage to obscure positive attributes and leave you feeling like you've just seen a rather mediocre TV movie-of- the-week.
6011|1|More gore, gross-outs than the other Indy blockbusters.
59582|0|Well-meaning but dramatically lopsided tearjerker bogs down in generic teen angst and domestic squabbling.
66469|1|Generally effective spy thriller with interesting cast
81292|0|Overall, the characters are not strong enough to provide any real emotional impact, and the violence and thrills are subsequently numbing.
5963|1|Sean Nelson, who turned 13 just before the film was shot, gives a fine, self-assured performance in the title role.
14586|1|Moves rather slowly, but the actors and their understated chemistry keep the film riveting, building to a climax that is absolutely heartrending.
80128|0|...despite every intention the movie can't quite shake its American male point of view.
63959|1|Modulating from heavy to light, from angry to lyrical, and so on, the movie's an enjoyable, emotional symphony.
15892|1|It is a pleasure to see such a tight work from Amaldovar.
21378|0|[A] stylish but overplotted and ultimately illogical combination of science fiction, mystery and romance.
2596|1|Like some manic slasher on the loose, Nic Roeg cuts compulsively, severing the natural arteries between cause and effect to expose a more irrational kind of narrative continuum...a true classic, worth looking at not just now but long into the future.
72846|0|One compelling story intertwined gracelessly with countless others ranging from mediocre to unspeakably idiotic.
65652|0|Unengaging maritime thriller from Ridley Scott. Good cast, but fails to connect.
6984|1|Offbeat and compelling neo-noir.
70552|0|Cuba Gooding Jr. and Beyonce Knowles bring us a rousing film about a gospel choir... too bad it goes straight to hell.
34497|0|This film reminded me of a Thomas Hardy type of novel that was written by someone who didn't have the writer's obvious talents.
48230|0|It's the film equivalent of a weary shrug - capturing the national mood at a moment when we'd all prefer some mood enhancers.

51843|0|... becomes indigestible.
13746|0|On the whole, Baldwin seems pretty dim for a renowned cyber-anarchist. Also, he simply isn't in the same class of actor as Tony Curtis. Or Laurence Fishburne, who swaggers through this mess with his usual suave manliness.
16149|1|Manages to be profound without being pompous.
50626|1|Even if Volver sounds too high-concept for you, know that Almod√≥var is smart enough not to rest on laughs alone, extending his premise to dark, though occasionally tidy psychological territory.

78889|1|Goes the distance as a parable about what is really means to have heart.
81919|1|Moreno communicates without words - she immediately sells the film, the concept, the struggle, the danger.
72875|1|Examples of film noir don't come much headier or more perverse than Charles Vidor's sultry little number...
14854|1|The atmospheric opening is the best part -- moody and full of sinister potential. After that, it's stilted drawing-room talk, variably acted, except for the cultish over-the-top dementia of Dwight Frye.
12427|1|Pre-Star Wars sci-fi; the events of the next year rendered it obsolete with record speed although there's a little more than usual here to enjoy.
46044|1|Maggie Smith in one of those technically stunning, emotionally distant performances that the British are so damn good at.
33614|1|Malle uses tons of editing tricks, both crude and cutting edge for the time, and turns Paris into a wild playground for a wonderfully anarchic romp.
11025|1|Laugh til' you drop - the musical version of The Producers is finally here. When Mel Brooks conceived his comedy satire, the subject matter of ridiculing Hitler was brave to say the least. And nearly 40 years later, it still leaves bite marks.
46887|1|Ithis is a career making movie, then its writer/director David O. Russell who deserves the credit with this very creative effort from the debut filmmaker.

57774|0|This jungle has no rhythm at all.
46332|1|Featuring an all-star cast (Paul Newman, Steve McQueen), the movie delivers the goods of a well-crafted disaster flick, but strangely, it was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar.

76192|0|The nerds' rap number, in which they sing of nerd pride, is probably the high point of this whole endeavor.
38835|1|It is less a movie about dementia than a movie which itself seems demented, though it is anyone's guess whether or not this effect is intended.

18658|1|Digital-video documentary about stand-up comedians is a great glimpse into a very different world.
50804|0|Humboldt County has an impressive cast and captures some of that era's fuzzy rebelliousness and humanism, but taken on its own the picture is finally thin stuff.
30794|1|The screenplay by newcomer Helen Childress falls back on familiar formulas too often, but first-time director Ben Stiller keeps the action fast and involving even when you can't help guessing what the next story twist will be.
53276|1|Deneuve, as the woman whose fear of sexual contact is at the base of her neurosis, has seldom been less like her icy self.
34781|1|Anderson uses snowy locations to impose a chilly menace on the characters, and the script ratchets the tension at a sneakily measured pace.
23717|0|A headache of a movie with a Parent Trap premise that quickly devolves into clamorous farce.
19490|0|It plays like nothing so much as an extended In Living Color stretched to fill 90 minutes, and it feels as thin as it sounds like it should. By the umpteenth variation of mistaking Calvin for a baby the joke has long, long stopped being funny.
24438|1|The grandfather in spirit and fact of both Tex Avery and Billy Wilder.
12183|1|Brimming with colour and passion, it pulls its emotional kick from tremendous performances, not least from Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable as the love-hate lovers.

54964|1|Disturbia takes it's time setting up the thrills and Shia LaBeouf actually acts like a high schooler.
3287|1|Jones' re-creation of his stage role is an eye-riveting experience. The towering rages and unrestrained joys of which his character was capable are portrayed larger than life.
79712|0|The movie is extremely long (two hours and 34 minutes) and so slow that by the end you feel as if you've been standing up even if you've been sitting down.
15481|1|Overblown, but good anyway.
34226|0|Full of jokes that fall flat.
3111|1|A fantastic look at the anachronisms of small-town life and the myriad problems of coping with a go-nowhere existence.

56789|1|Most horrifying is the potential inability to sway our own innately darker tendencies.
48025|0|The roman numeral in the title is the most sophisticated thing about the sequel. Otherwise, this radioactive spawn of Wes Craven is abysmal, stupid and -- horror of all horrors! -- incredibly boring.
29914|0|"Sequel to the mediocre Ben Stiller comedy ""Meet The Parents"" is a bawdier but inferior movie that relies on the star power of Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand as Stiller's Florida-dwelling Jewish hippie parents Bernie and Roz to fuel its ill-timed toi"

23581|1|Witty, urbane, original and very dated.
28372|1|The story darts in unexpected, dark directions, but is told by such talented people, we follow it willingly...

70119|1|If you open yourself up to Mr. Reggio's theory of this imagery as the movie's set ... it can impart an almost visceral sense of dislocation and change.
28035|1|This is extremely silly, good natured, superficial stuff; a lot depends on whether you take to Bill and Ted's unique lingo (which contorts surfers' expressions) and their gormless behaviour.
18455|1|An amiable comedy full of chase, chase, fall-down, chase.
4832|0|With no real redemption at the end of the road, it is nothing more than a beautiful, empty journey.
4096|1|The fact that the director never once caves into easy sentiment or cheap hectoring is almost as amazing as the story itself.

49144|0|The Duke is an oil-fire fighter running around the world putting out blazes.
45558|1|Fellini's solo directing debut, a charming fable about a newlywed couple, shows themes and characters that will reappear in his future work, not to mention the significance of wife actress Masina.
1810|1|There's a pleasant little story, plenty of pathos mixed with the large doses of humor, a number of appealing new animal characters, lots of good music, and the usual Disney skillfulness in technique.
49949|1|This heart-stopping revenge flick written by Luc Besson is easily Liam Neeson's most memorable performance since his Oscar-nominated outing in Schindler's List.
48212|0|If it's not the most awful thing I've ever seen, it's close enough to make me wince.
32414|1|Well-intentioned and well-acted but unconvicning, this saga provides an instructive example to the simplistic approach taken by movies when tackling the social problem of racism.
30104|0|Viewers are spared nothing as Steve Burns undergoes degrading brutality after brutality; virtually nobody is portrayed sympathetically.
10626|0|One would expect a holiday epic with a title like Santa Claus: The Movie. It implies something definitive, which would therefore put it in the canon of Christmas classics. However, this is definitely not the case.

14783|1|may inspire some to get off at 191st street
15746|1|Woods' angry energy is clarifying as well as terrifying, and when he unleashes it (usually without warning), the effect is to focus our attention where it belongs, not on a suspense story but on the mysteries of human behavior.
71360|0|The performances ensure that this is never less than watchable but it's not as clever or as funny as it should have been.
2992|0|While this would have made an incredible 45-minute short, the film tries to cover too much territory, being diverted by its subplots.
78325|1|...it's got a gentle charisma that's hard to resist....a film with little substance but loads of charm.

62949|1|Re-cut or not, The Shining remains one of the most viscerally disturbing films ever made.
13146|1|Benefits immensely from being graded on a curve: it's no Ghostbusters, but it's no Police Academy either.
12198|1|...a captivating romantic comedy that lives up to its place as a classic of the genre.
8873|1|Set in the Depression, Benton's memory film is too sanctimonious and idealistic, showing how economic misery and hard times bring out the best, here in the form of a new community, composed of a white widow and her children, a black hobo and a blind.
53694|1|Sentimental and contrived, Benigni's well-intentioned Holocaust dramedy may only work as a children's fable. Inexplicably, it won a prize at the 1998 Cannes Festival.
42141|1|Extremely funny, ultra-hip and alarmingly insightful.
49594|0|The late Gene Siskel once devised a simple method of measuring a film's worth: 'Is this film more interesting than a documentary of the same actors having lunch?' 'Alone in the Dark' doesn't come close to matching that standard.

55109|0|More bad things happen to these four women than one independent film can possibly carry.
48048|1|You wouldn't want to spend too much time here, but a weekend's good value
54601|1|I still like the movie for the way it immerses itself in each moment, and for the intense way it moves and sounds.
8523|1|Well-acted and deliberately stagey, this is a controversial, typically misogynistic tale from writer-director Neil LaBute that is certain to divide both critics and audiences alike.
8973|1|To this day, six months after seeing the film for the first time, I still do not know the answer to one of the biggest moral dilemmas I have ever seen. Casey Affleck's character has to make a decision at the end of this film that just blew my mind.
21692|1|Like many of the best documentaries, [it] doesn't take us exactly where we expect to go.

66479|1|One of the top adventure films of all-time; beautiful African scenery.
1797|0|The only reason a person hops back-and-forth in one scene, from scene to scene, using (a) color film, (b) black-and-white stock, and (c) digital video (then back to (b), then (c) again, then (a), then...) is merely to do it because they can.
44719|0|...the movie has some good moments of intrigue and adventure, and with a more charismatic hero it might have worked better.
13419|0|Blankman's use of the cheesy effects from the Batman TV show, including Polito trying to imitate The Penguin, was initially a good idea but the execution is simply horrible and this is what winds up ruining the film.
7955|1|Like Shaun of the Dead as rewritten by Eug√®ne Ionesco.... Has the surface qualities of a spoof, but none of its comfy core.

21407|1|A psychologically strung-out tale stuffed full of ideas and inspired moments.
15238|0|Madchen Amick is super-sexy. Some of the love scenes are steamier than cooked rice. If that's your idea of entertainment, you've found your baby.
22533|1|One of the first movies to parody gangsta rap, it does so knowingly and affectionately.
9644|0|This movie is great for a few laughs, especially if you fall into the right age category. But don't expect it to change your life.
68574|1|Potemkin is a vital viewing experience that transcends its landmark/milestone status.
55719|0|Classically awful

33353|1|I enjoyed the movie for the sheer physical exuberance of its adventure.
2290|1|Pray's fast-paced editing matches the Paskowitzes' rootless existence, though at times it's difficult to keep track of who's who.

76720|1|Ultimately concerned less with specific tactical maneuvers or combat suffering than with the grand contradictions of life.
67841|1|Mann's last western, and his most disturbing foray into the genre.
64107|1|This movie goes so far in the opposite direction of most films about teenagers that it might anger some viewers with its no-holds-barred honesty.
45006|1|None of the forced violence, lawlessness, rapist, gratuitous speed aspects of the motorbike clan in this perceptive film.
50633|1|It still remains a very interesting and entertaining piece of classic science fiction cinema.
18229|0|"Reminds us, unequivocally, why 3-D has yet to catch on. ""Special"" effects notwithstanding, this Robert Rodriguez quickie is strictly for the younger set."

34104|1|Considered a dunderheaded big-budget flop in its day, Last Action Hero looks considerably better now in its creative self-parody. [Blu-ray]
5979|1|It's a touching film in which the actors, including director Chen Kaige in the role of Prof. Yu, deliver heart-touching performances.
62664|1|A wry thriller with a keen edge.
62584|0|A good, romantic melodrama that suffers more than most good, romantic melodramas in not being much better than it is.

74532|0|This Bond eats quiche.
70255|1|Once this film gets its bearings, the unsentimental fierceness of its vision brushes obstacles and quibbles from its path.
24007|0|With bland protagonists and power figures unpleasant enough for us to want them out of our sight more than we want them defeated, it doesn't do much to hold our interest.
76002|0|Taken as a disposable sort of cable television flick, this movie could capably fill 90-some uneventful minutes.
63356|1|Highly recommended even if Al Gore is incapable of getting at the root cause of global warming.
32074|0|Potential laughs are largely lost due to the one-note nature of the characters.

34133|1|Coppola's style had healthy roots in the screwball comedies of the '30s, and the glorious performances litter the film with moments to treasure.
58870|1|Bresson sees spiritual disorder as a disease, not unlike the stomach cancer we suspect is-and is ultimately confirmed to be-plaguing our titular character.
9382|0|However sincere it may be, The Rising Place never quite justifies its own existence.
48419|1|Very Annie-Mary is familiar but winningly funny and good-hearted.
19579|0|Unhappily, the story didn't need to get this involved and it winds up constantly trying to pull the picture apart, working against the comedy.
28968|1|This war film is also Peckinpah's last great movie.
69104|1|Robards' warm performance makes the film into a casual delight.
8744|1|It may not pull off any state-of-the art animation coups, but The Wild Thornberrys Movie understands that strong characters and involving storytelling are still the bottom line in a quality kids' film.
40784|0|The result is a deep desire for those Hollywood execs to remember that Christian doesn't have to equal brain-dead.
55534|0|Goldberg's unconvincing makeup looks like a cheap latex Halloween mask of a cross between Marlon Brando and the guy on the Quaker Oats box.
48054|0|So it goes, snagging every tripwire of pert banality and ditzy knowingness.
33608|1|Since the plot is ridiculous, The Rock works best when it's most light-hearted.
13091|0|Were it not for the horses, the script as filmed could easily be performed on the stage as a three-act play.
37395|1|Not as good as the original, but enjoyable nonetheless.
40414|0|You'd be hard-pressed to come up with a movie that ticks more of the boxes for a perfect storm of So Bad It's Perfect.
77203|0|This profane British crime story is to be remembered more for its intoxicating visual vigor and one blowtorch performance than character arcs, caper thrills or revelatory surprises.
79418|1|Billy Jack is the nicest surprise of the year, and my own feeling is that it ranks among the top half-dozen American films so far in 1971.

5911|0|Benigni is floundering here, and it only gets worse as the film goes along. There's no real sense of any danger, no real identification with any of the characters. No laughs, which is what you need in a comedy.
70862|0|Sad to say, it is far from a major statement from one of our greatest living directors.
18002|1|It's a story as old as time redone in books and films over and over again. But this one's got the one-of-a-kind Henson vision and style.
74904|0|It's back to the drawing board for the TV show's creators, who have previously proven themselves capable of much better than this soggy and waterlogged miscalculation.
63353|1|The line between truth and illusion is blurred so persuasively that for a moment or two, you may even believe that a romantic costume drama could stand up to all those special-effects blockbusters in the dog days of summer.

12231|1|A cohesive demonstration of why Wilco, as a whole, is one of the most compelling musical entities working today.
6669|0|A big, noisy headache of a movie...
44623|0|The movie is 'faithful' to the novel with a vengeance -- to what happens in the novel, that is, and not to the feel, mood, and spirit of it.
81164|0|Certainly the special effects, designed by the wizards at Rhythm and Hues, reach a new plateau of believability for talking-animal CGI.
6842|0|Harlin, in telling a standard tale of morality and conflict, turns in a plotless, empty picture that dissolves into an emotionless videogame.
57350|1|Come Undone ends with less than a proper gut-punch of cumulative effect, but this self-consciously modern movie contains classical pleasures.
73980|1|Terence Young's direction is nothing if not taut, whisking the narrative along with the speed and precision of a jet plane, defying one to express boredom.
52090|0|Alfred Hitchcock may be the Master of Suspense, but that doesn't make him incapable of making a lousy film.
64464|0|It will seem suspenseful only to those who wonder whether Mr. Stallone can get the dog out alive.
46060|1|It is ridiculous. It is a little teensy bit sexist. It is a relic of a bygone age. It is as predictable as the sunrise. It is also, of course, rip-roaring fun.
53660|1|The performance that sticks is the one by Eugene Levy, whose work conveys a tenderness that momentarily slices through the satire.

10094|0|An end-of-summer throwaway that resembles last year's Supercross in its naked ineptitude and willingness to cut corners at every turn.
12086|1|Though hypocritical in the way it sensationalizes sexuality, this serious and funny 1998 movie about a 15-year-old coming to terms with her body and her family in 1976 is, refreshingly, never coy or ironic.
36171|1|An excellently performed, superbly written film
66057|1|Weir and his crew expertly recreate the squalor, poverty, noise, heat and emotion of the pressure cooker that was Indonesia in 1965.

21663|1|The supporting cast is remarkable, especially Red Buttons.

71358|1|An entertaining diversion.
17471|1|The classic backstage musical, still great
15935|0|A bad sit-com of a movie.

77825|0|Having changed into action gear, the picture never looks back, leaving two people who seemed wonderfully unique to do things that are cinematically trite.
15173|1|Damon proves once again that he's not just a face, and he does wonders with his inner and outer conflicts. Norton is wickedly sleazy as a barely-in-control low life who will undoubtedly end up back in the slammer.

9577|1|It's mildly, amiably funny, in a juvenile way.
10334|0|If you thought Murphy's recent movies have been increasingly bland, this is certainly more of the same.
63205|1|A film in search of profound truths that it can only hint at having caught glimmerings of, and it's a truly remarkable experience.

11896|1|Billy Wilder's take on human selfishness and callousness makes for one of the most angry and cynical films ever made.
1194|1|Kaye shoots in black and white, a stark reminder of how there is no middle ground when it comes to abortion in America... and also, perhaps, a bit of a cushion against the authenticity of Kaye's harsh vision.
28455|1|Uneven Brooks satire of Hitchcock. Some of it works.
24965|1|An affecting story that dares to dig deeper than the usual romantic comedy fluff.
17750|1|A sweet little anachronistic musical fairy tale along the lines of 'Shrek.'
33595|1|A heartbreaking and complex film about human relationships.
12297|1|Grand and poetic and overcooked, which I'm sure Melville would have been proud of.
38520|1|Coppola's take on S.E. Hinton's classic. Teens+.
32153|1|It's the music, ecstatic, delirious, overwhelming, that is the star of the show: the bossa nova has never had a setting like this.
21926|0|Besides the unconvincing shift of psychic gears, the picture has no theme, no resonance, no point.
59808|1|The quintessential film noir -- acid and snappy, and shockingly cold-blooded.
44624|0|Uh, Mr. Projectionist? Could you stop the movie? I wanna get off now.
65575|0|More a soap opera story of wartime romances than an action war film.

63954|0|The setup is gripping, and the suspense intense, but the third act -- the payoff for sitting through such harrowing material -- is a major misfire.
1220|1|Ultimately, it is a serviceable, well-made thriller that earns its R rating.
32791|0|After the agonizing torture that was endured I can safely make the statement that Strangeland is now and will be the worst film of 1998.
37249|0|...it's up to the animation to keep us entertained, and those sections turn out to be much too predictable.
49988|1|I was not thrilled about having to see it. But, sitting there in the dark, I became tremendously moved by the movie, and I have not forgotten its power.
11413|1|One of those rare movies that I know I shouldn't like, but... I cannot help but enjoy it.
60070|1|... a study in the deterioration of the human body... and the will it takes to endure such self-mortification in the name of cause.
61153|0|Newman is literally a diamond in the rough, and it requires a certain forebearance to separate his quality from the surrounding raunch.

69064|1|It's both a summation of Capra's own career and a peak of achievement for a gentler kind of American cinema
14182|1|If anyone needs convincing of Garbo's mysterious, magical talent, her role as the 17th-century Swedish Queen Christina is a persuasive argument for her genius.
79785|1|Whether disappointed or elated, Cameron Crowe's observations are trenchant. Instinct is the greatest asset as idols let you down. That first gulp of passion in a profession can quench you for years. Quite often, bassists and drummers have little to say.

51228|1|Kids seeing this film first may well end up with a better understanding of the Bard's work.
34730|1|Elevated from the doldrums of Digby-esque sentimentality by a surprisingly bouncy script, the film is also redeemed by regular interludes of acerbic dialogue and a brace of fine supporting performances.
80876|0|Dreadfully, unspeakably bad.
28986|1|Sandra Bullock is in a class of her own and it's only partly a matter of beauty. Perhaps the larger part is that shining, irresistible personality that lights a room, a runway, a silver screen. She can get you interested in the phone directory.

43818|1|The penultimate entry in Eric Rohmer's series of Six Moral Tales, and the loveliest, most crystalline of the lot.
246|1|Redgrave's performance is superb and she's ably supported by Holm, Dench, and Hamilton in particular.
43492|1|Otto Preminger, no stranger to ruffling moral-watchdog feathers, never succumbs to the sleaziness inherent in the material, instead turning out an intelligent and tightly controlled drama that ranks as one of the all-time great courtroom procedurals.
33434|1|Breezy and freespirited Australian comedy.
6996|1|This early effort remains an interesting part of Coppola's filmography -- certainly more than such latter-day stinkbombs as Jack and Youth Without Youth.
60639|1|An ambitious experiment that makes for a more satisfying intellectual puzzle than it does an involving narrative.
61555|1|Williams gives a fine performance, the rest of the cast is also excellent, and director Sidney Lumet's eye for detail is sure throughout this authentic look at the dirtier side of police work.

51464|1|The Painted Veil has a real pulse. It sweeps you up in the characters' journey from the beginning, and keeps you riveted from moment to moment.
46258|0|Because it was produced by disgraced (and imprisoned) Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff, the movie is now loaded with an eerie unintentional laughter it didn't have for its original viewers.

27423|1|Sam Peckinpah followed The Wild Bunch with this intimate, eccentric, appealing 1970 comedy, which treats many of the same themes in a soft, regretful mode.
44775|1|Moving story of justice but too intense for kids.
81168|1|As a study of how the current corporate idiocy impacts one man's art, it's priceless.
44954|1|The material here is expressed with a real sweetness and tenderness, and considering how heavy some of the themes are, the film is quite subtle.
10279|1|Lacking even a Changing Lanes level of insight into America's racial partition, this old-school, domestic-invasion thriller still has Samuel L Jackson's twisted enforcer to push the right buttons.

52520|1|Richly atmospheric, with its expressive use of colour, lyrical cutaways, and masterly interior compositions -- predominantly shot from Ozu's trademark low-level camera position -- impressively illustrating the director's visual artistry.
73870|1|Bresson's films are the most sublime expression of the powerful, illicit sexuality of the movement of moving pictures against a subjective audience.

23754|1|Hides a big heart beneath a small piglet.
9405|1|Charming family movie for tweens and up.
33017|1|A happy Christmas package that more or less ignores the fact that it's a black American family story
54099|1|It has survived the years much better than other indulgent frolics, mainly because Malle really does seem motivated by gleeful malice and anarchy -- he's not just toying with a fashionable mood.
23296|1|...the ultimate nostalgia movie of all time ...
55949|1|Probably won't appeal to teens.
19659|1|A spectacular comedy-adventure that's never less than totally immersive. Not quite the masterpiece that Toy Story was, but it's the closest Pixar have come since.
16003|1|The writing is sharp and the characters cool, while at the film's heart lies an innocence that resonates with us all.
1329|1|If it takes too many familiar steps, it is still never less than compelling as it walks the well-trod line.
3136|1|Seventy minutes into the film, there's a rude burst of mariachi music as the hero awakes... That wouldn't be worth noting, except that we suddenly realize that for the first tense, suspense-filled hour of the film there has been no music at all.

6432|1|I wish the film had expanded its view... and yet what we get, while not much, is at least sufficient.
43481|1|The disturbing, embarrassing domestic moments and conflicts are quirky, slightly weird, and yet they boast the shock of recognition because they're so true to the strife in every family.
74002|1|...a stylish, sporadically gripping thriller that boasts a number of undeniably tense sequences and interludes...
44446|1|The film's strength lies in its depiction of surfaces, lacking the visual or intellectual imagination to go beyond its shrewd social and psychological observations and its moments of absurdist humour.
46183|1|There's an old-fashioned romanticism about the picture, a sweet, gentle approach to love and family life. But this is kept from seeming sappy by the picture's tough-minded, almost abrasive sense of humor.
55387|0|The confusing storytelling and bad dialogue probably won't bother adult fans of sophisticated animation for whom the imaginative, elegant visuals of Vampire Hunter D should be enough to satisfy.
3940|1|Simmering performances from the three lead characters that hit all the right buttons in this portrait of sibling rivalry.
15412|0|A disgustingly violent morass of high-tech beatings and killings.

14754|1|One of my favorite sci-fi films of recent years.
1156|0|Overstuffed with characters and contrivances.
26014|1|It's a powerful film and a terrific showcase for the versatility of star Robert De Niro.

13470|0|Those of us with brain cells, however, will spit out this Scream retread like it was spider-egg-laced bubble gum.
16767|1|It's rather slow and a bit overlong (139 minutes), it may not be for everyone, but for viewers with the patience, the rewards are many.
36563|0|For months now, Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro have been sitting in their dens and nervously clutching their Oscars. They knew that an unprecedented challenge was looming... the arrival of Hulk Hogan in his first starring role in a movie.
18367|0|Too much of it is admirable without necessarily being engaging, serving as a mere litany of childhood miseries.
35048|1|Funny film that sort of play-acts being a black comedy
1908|1|There's definitely more than three rings' worth of death-defying feats, high-flying slapstick and even a few well-trained animal acts.

2725|1|One of the most entertaining films of the year.
59787|1|It's a thoughtful, multi-layered film that falls a bit short of its goals on all fronts.

15063|0|Kid-friendly violence -- what a concept.
10162|1|For a film starring the national debt, this is a good one. The expected tedious numerical research is accompanied by excellent graphics and archival footage that bring it alive. Is anyone listening?
20121|1|Pretty good half-term holiday fare.
45280|1|Problematic but ultimately irresistible adaptation of Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey's hit Broadway musical. [Blu-ray]

3482|1|like updating Bergman for this millennium
62975|1|This male version of The Devil Wears Prada comes off second best in the comparison, but is nevertheless an entertaining jest about a young Brit who is not only a fish out of water but totally out of the fishtank
3148|0|Easily the weakest of the original cast Star Trek films.
22024|0|The filmmakers' stoicism finally proves insurmountable and indefatigable
61916|1|Rarely seen character study of baseball great Jimmy Piersall with great work by Anthony Perkins in title role--and Karl Malden as his demanding dad.
429|1|The plot is hamstrung by trite formulas, and there's too much violence and family tension for very young viewers. Shaquille O'Neal is likable as the title character, though.
29447|1|Undeniably compelling, it's proof of the therapeutic potential of filmmaking, but also of our limitless propensity for morbid curiosity.
27500|1|It's just about good enough to make us forget how unfortunate Ocean's Twelve really was
74691|0|While there are parts of Two for the Money worth watching, it's ultimately not one worth putting your money on.
12832|1|We may wonder if happiness can be bought this way, and whether the film being sold to us isn't a slightly suspect package, but Smith, sublime and moving, sells it regardless.
69112|0|The kind of sappy, sadness-turns- to-gladness holiday movie that shows up on cable TV this time of year.
46377|0|There are simply too many ludicrous elements to ignore: Paulie's robot; Brigitte Nielsen, even less expressive than the robot; about a thousand music-video-styled montages; Lundgren's delivery of Drago's deadly dialogue; etc.
31937|1|Though diffuse and overlong, and its politics vague, the film's star performances of Ingrid Bergman and Gary Cooper are appealing; Hemingway wrote the novel with Coop in mind.
1763|1|Has several parallel storylines, and all of them work.
10728|1|I have no doubt that the novel makes this movie seem but a glissando of a complex series of emotional notes, but I can say that I was torn up every which way by the end of it.
39177|0|Despite the expository speeches draped over this like birthday bunting, the story remains largely incomprehensible.
17625|1|Emphasizing the sensual and musical elements of the rock opera, Ken Russell brings his excessive visual flourishes to the material and also get good performances from Ann-Margret and Oliver Reed, resulting in an original musical movie.
8024|1|A breezy diary from a pair of first-time farmers, as well as a wry rebuke to a nation devoted to eating cheaply but not necessarily well, King Corn makes its points without much finger-wagging.

10483|1|A fresh, intelligent and thoroughly involving psychological thriller.
71233|1|The diffused momentum arguably suits the subject: that's teen turmoil for you, heightened here by the troubles of time and place.
1827|1|Elegant and powerful, accommodating collisions of class and temperament with the grace of a perfect Edwardian hostess, Howards End is the work to which all Merchant Ivory's other films have pointed and aspired.
64334|1|A solid-but-frustratingly-tantalizing experience.
12043|0|At heart it's a terribly anguished expression of rejection, loneliness and love. If only it knew when to stop.
40324|0|Life's too short.
53277|1|A sumptuously produced period piece that is also a rich tapestry of childhood memoirs and moods, fear and fancy, employing all the manners and means of the best of cinematic theatrical from high and low comedy to darkest tragedy.
16489|1|While it may not be as slick as Miller's other films featuring Gibson's iconic anti-hero, Mad Max still remains a timeless classic and one of the more remarkable films of its (or any) time.
17319|0|Another lousy movie adapted from Stephen King's writing; another slander against the mentally ill; another energetic Depp performance in a losing cause.
65991|0|If creating a non-offensive movie filled with sweet dinosaurs who have had a lot of time on their hands and not much to do is a measure of success, then the movie accomplishes what it set out to do.

16878|0|Seems too precalculated to be charming and magical, and consequently ends up being overly cute.
50071|0|Though it was earnest in its heartfelt message, the film was not remarkable enough to make it memorable.

53554|1|This isn't a first time a long-awaited movie has turned out to be a crushing disappointment and it won't be the last, but the loss is made even more wrenching when one considers how little it would have taken to make Cast Away a great movie.

54324|0|A lightweight fanboy valentine for ostensibly heavyweight music.
6411|0|It's a toss-up as to whether September Dawn is more offensive as history, as allegory or simply as lousy self-important filmmaking.

20751|1|Broad, bubbly, and kind of adorable.
25018|1|If you can watch the opening fifteen minutes without wincing, you're made of stern stuff. One of Li's most brutal works.
52694|1|"His film is both a good mystery movie and a good movie-movie; its sheer ""movieness"" is what gives the picture its kick. As his career progressed, Branagh may very well have made better films than 'Dead Again.' But he never made another one this fun."

74387|1|A significant influence on Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch, this grueling pile driver of a movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.
39117|1|Before singing nuns, there were singing priests, such as Bing Crosby as Father O'Malley in Leo McCarey's charming sequel that's better (and was more popular at the box-office) than the original, the 1944 Oscar-winner Going My Way.
16182|1|If you didn't like the first one, stay away, but if you got a few good chuckles out of it, you'll get more of the same with the sequel. I guess it's a matter of personal (bad) taste.

81749|0|Ultimately, La Scorta is a tight, competent but rather inconsequential thriller. It's diverting, but thin.

6223|1|If you analyze it logically, 'Lucia, Lucia' doesn't make much sense, but if you buy into its zany obfuscation, it can be fun.
16520|0|Neither Macy nor Basinger nor the intriguing setup nor the bursts of situational wit can rescue this thriller from joining the category of movies that are so bad they're good.
6480|1|Frailty marks a fine directorial debut for Bill Paxton. He judges the material expertly and brings it to the boil effectively ...
6527|0|Strongly told stories have a way of carrying their characters along with them. But here we have an undefined character in an aimless story. Too bad.
12058|1|Schwarzenegger, who when he dons a green suit is dubbed 'Gumby' by Belushi, is right on target with his characterization of the iron-willed soldier, and Belushi proves a quicksilver foil.
16851|1|Although the movie is remarkably schmaltzy, it's sweet and affecting, too, with Sandler's character as genuinely nice as he can be.

63371|0|The characters in this film are weak-willed, pathetic losers. I just couldn't muster much sympathy for the characters that couldn't burst out of the cages of their own design.

32851|0|Disney's worst animated feature.
24122|1|A solid bit of silly escapism, it's also a film that promises a lot, but never really amounts to anything, in the end...
65230|0|A terrible picture, absent rhythm and purpose, straining hard to remain charismatic and mysterious while it engages in pure nonsense, crudely arranged by Moyle in a career-killing feature.
64459|0|The recess bell should have rung immediately into the first period of this frothy yet flat and insufferable scholastic satire.

44990|0|A goofy, lightweight, paper-thin, schizophrenic mess.
34071|1|The Land Before Time works by evoking the simple virtues of this art aimed at children, as it was in the beginning when Disney animated Mickey Mouse. This film deserves a place next to the often-revived animated classics.
62329|1|...a good, rousing, Wild West adventure yarn.

60713|0|...the film eventually degenerates into a conventional and hackneyed mess.
40407|1|A frankly disturbing experience since Cage is at his most manic, the images are brutal, the documentary-style background intense and the (inevitable) theme of redemption a long time emerging.
43779|1|The movie has the look and feel of a western. The final showdown is in a ghost town in the desert.
50274|1|The animation is consistently excellent
49470|1|A winning and soul-stirring exploration of the spiritual meaning of one man's sacrificial death.
38291|1|Here's the season's most delicious and unexpected surprise. Despite the horror-flick title, Gremlins is a movie of wicked wit and startling invention, and it has a heart that's at least a match for the special effects.
7358|0|The film is formulaic and the plot is barely connected together. But it moves along quickly and there's the occasional smile.
61554|0|A plodding and unimaginative screenplay.
3918|1|The odd psychological interplay between the gutsy, but green, Starling and the deranged, yet fascinating, Lecter provides the basic tone for Jonathan Demme's well-made, insidious shocker.
81211|1|The score of Lerner and Lowe's Broadway hit is lovely and Gene Kelly is good but Van Johnson is weak
73092|0|Despite the interesting set-up, the action degenerates into obvious implausibility and silliness - fatal for a suspense thriller - and boredom sets in.
28326|1|Nair leavens her story of a desperately impoverished 11-year-old (Shafiq Syed) with enough sentimentality to insure broad audience appeal.
55950|1|The convictions of the cast and an extremely snappy script fill in most of the gaps caused by the wobbly plotlines.
36325|0|The emphasis here is on farce rather than action, to an extent that may disappoint hard-core martial arts fanatics.
51049|1|This is a classic 'women's picture' in every sense.
20317|0|The cinematic equivalent of yoga-class muzak
56791|0|Helen Mirren's acting stands out in this mean-spirited dark comedy like an original Picasso in a paint-by-numbers art show.
57322|0|If you really, really need an escapist flick of no real relevance, Crocodile Dundee II will serve you well by eliminating almost two whole hours of your life. Just don't expect to care too much about it by the end.
77327|1|One of Louis Malle's finest early films.
56353|1|Its themes are also more relevant and understandable, but Heaven is still premeditated, conceptual, and vigilant.
62060|1|If camp comedy capering (don't call it a social satire!) isn't your thing, it's worth the ticket to see Monroe's iconic and flawlessly choreographed performance of Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend (TM): a perfect four minutes of film.
19649|0|If you are a fan of the original film, this remake might interest you. It's not badly made. But why was it made at all?
1322|1|Committed performances and a teasing structure give weight to this minor enterprise.
51391|1|A bit overlong, but thoroughly enjoyable period musical.
52154|1|The set design, however, merely disguises what is in fact an intimate and likeable picture.
68648|1|Planes, Trains and Automobiles showed that Hughes wasn't in fact some man-child searching for the reasons for his adulthood discontentment.

71564|1|Goldberg and Parker are extraordinary.
3880|0|Miss Potter is not a bad film, but it is a more tepid treatment than the facts of her life would seem to call for. Beatrix Potter deserves better.
20411|1|From its snarky water-cooler comedy to its satisfying dabblings in feminism, the movie has a championship heart in Testud, an electric screen presence any audience will follow as willingly as the camera tracks her marvelously expressive features.
30705|0|Friction is of a schematic sort that all too often seems mainly intent on recalling spiritual predecessors Midnight Cowboy and Five Easy Pieces.
16840|1|Leigh's extensive use of improvisation in rehearsal led to a razor-sharp final script, endlessly blooming with memorable dialogue that‚Äîwhile never less than credibly naturalistic‚Äîproves thematically fertile. [Blu-ray]
5289|0|Anyone seeking a good time that involves wit and logic will consider the film a definite wrong number.
3030|0|Moore's only non-docu is a misfire, a diffuse, unfunny political satire that only John Candy's most avid fans might enjoy.
43720|0|If you like watching anarchy in action, this exhibition has its moments, but the anti-woman humour underpinning it -- and Cook's whole performance -- does cast a pall.
18627|1|Really good animated movie. Full of action, excitement and character.
20042|1|A stupendous production, Master and Commander satisfies as richly as a book might, immersing us in a world of its people and its places.
14672|1|Scene after scene is filled with a ferocious strength and humor.
55007|0|Winter Passing's quirky elements and light comedic touches fail to save it from its dark and lumbering premise.
68110|1|It's a movie that feels both of its time and ahead of all the times that have followed.
22758|1|A great kids' film, and a vehicle for a beloved character that will hopefully send parents scurrying to the bookstore for the genuine article.
11226|1|It is one of the great movies (not film, but movie; there's a difference) of al time, as perfect an action film as one could ask for.
6896|1|This is fun action sleaze from the classic era of drive-in blaxploitation films, driven by the no-nonsense direction of Jack Hill, and did well enough at the box office to help put the still-gorgeous Pam Grier on the map. Don't miss it.
67000|1|"It's a simple comedy that tries to be nothing but. At times it is simple hilarity, other times it's a little too ""Napoleon Dynamite"" for its own good."
79231|0|As a depiction of a loving-turbulent relationship between a single mom (Susan Sarandon) and her rebellious teenage daughter (Natalie Portman), Wang's meller is nicely crafted but old-fashioned like Hollywood's weepies of yesteryear.
70413|1|Equally heartfelt, equally moving, equally astute about the iconographies of movies and classic characters, Rocky Balboa -- and I hate to say it, but what can I say -- knocked me out.
62183|1|Trembles, bubbles and booms with rage--every explosion shattering the idea that global warfare has ever had an end in sight.
20732|1|The movie hits as much as it misses, with enough witty observations to ensure that somewhere, Kesselman's mother is kvelling.
4946|1|A genuine American classic.
10698|1|A relentless and painfully funny critique of masculine pretense and selfishness, of which wine fetishism is the apotheosis.
25307|0|This is the kind of flick that finds two racers seriously endangering the city streets only to have a Yoda/Luke moment and walk away without so much as a police warning.
29668|1|Succeeds admirably in showing us just how much love the heart can hold in the face of so many obstacles and so much pain.
45659|0|You've got to hand it to director Michael Lembeck... he's succeeded in persuading studio bosses to let him make not one but two sequels from premises that were dead in the water from the word go.
33615|0|Too meekly middlebrow to really affront
18410|1|From the well-placed and effectively used fake-out scares to the finely oiled secondary stock characters, from the charismatic lead characters to the creepy visuals, the film hits all its marks smoothly.
57044|0|"Even when the astronauts are running out of oxygen, they still insist on espousing their theories about life, science and God. Had the movie any sexual or racial tension, it could pass itself off as ""The Real World: Mars."""
41578|0|Yossi & Jagger doesn't quite translate.This military drama about relationships among a group of bored, horny soldiers lacks enough intensity to be taken very seriously.
80931|1|With entertainment this cardboard and weightless, isn't a response like disappointment disproportionately complex?
52257|0|Charmless and brainless.
44723|1|As classy and charming a romantic comedy as you're ever likely to see...
26281|1|Griffin's keen wit, coupled with director Gallo's sense of pacing & alternating stage and offstage material makes this more than a concert film.
16341|1|John Travolta continues to establish himself as one of the best actors of the younger generation, and this may be his best job yet.
32898|1|One can't help but start planning a vacation immediately after the film ends
23871|1|The impression is of an old-school horror with sporadically interesting experimental ornamentation.
29196|0|The dialogue seldom rises above the level of twaddle -- unspeakable in every sense of the word.
19980|0|The film itself is so riddled with cliches, stereotypes and improbabilities that word of mouth is sure to limit the movie's prospects.
62601|0|Engaging, even though it lacks a single likeable character and is packed with cliches.
28588|0|It's no-win stuff. It's not offensive enough to appeal to Green's (ever-decreasing) fan-base, nor witty enough to convince anyone else.
1043|1|Interesting as a claustrophobic vision.
64792|1|Don't go to it for a Hollywood happy ending. Go to it to learn what it can take to be alive.
76956|1|The dark, steel engraving look that cinematographer Eduardo Serra has given Jude endows it with a somber magnificence.
75846|1|A fun and worthy sequel that really continues the harrowing but exciting exploits of Indiana Jones...
74327|0|The film ends up having more laughs than a comedy.
21824|1|Twists, turns and top performances
35777|1|Hanks and Newman are the personification of anguish and torn loyalty in a gripping, violent film that is part character study and part cat-and-mouse chase with classic western embellishments.
20716|1|Excellent romantic comedy. Exciting story of adults trying to succeed in careers with the drawbacks of children.
8983|0|One of those films where the term 'character study' is used to excuse the fact that there's nothing of real interest in the story.
56167|0|Whereas White Castle had a freshness in its humor, Guantanamo goes crude for the sake of crudeness, to the point of ruining entire scenes.
19700|0|There's little to nothing funny about this.
65178|1|This is the third movie with Jack as its hero, so he is a known quantity -- a humanist spook with an overdeveloped moral sense -- but Ford, playing the part for the second time, knows how to keep his earnestness fresh.
42474|0|If you want to be frightened, don't bother with this remake.
51684|0|It's the usual quick-cut, this-is-all-we-can-show-you R-rated mayhem.
69192|1|A poetic, slow-burning tale of America's pioneering past, it's an off-beat western and one of Altman's finest films.
59851|1|A high-end horror film, very clever, funny and scary.
65006|0|The perfect maudlin holiday entertainment.
30799|1|Vacancy may not be the most wholly original thriller but it has some heart to it and is directed with gritty, old school style by Nimr√≥d Antal. Coupled with the good work done by the leads, Vacancy is worth checking into.
16051|1|One of the better examples of romantic comedies doing the rounds and even though it is overlong at times, it will make for passable video fodder one dreary Sunday evening.
41922|0|An awkward, overstuffed and occasionally painful delusion of grandeur ...
76182|1|The truth is out there. And the truth is that The X-Files's Gillian Anderson is badly miscast as Lily Bart.
49582|1|The movie was a bear to make and it shows onscreen, parading around a series of mesmerizing set-pieces that look deliciously hard-earned in ways our current CG-drenched filmmaking climate never allows.
75938|0|I'd cheerfully vote the writers, director and producers of My Fellow Americans out of office.
14911|0|The movie never transcended its elaborate production work to achieve an independent reality. It's simply pictures of what never happened.
81331|0|Jolie kept her side of the deal, everyone else owes her big time.
15413|0|...prone to loud noises, loud music, and red herrings for its scare tactics. Before we know it, cheap thrills substitute for serious plot development.
7320|0|Dash's film is less the stuff cults are made of than fantasies.
10885|1|Top-notch espionage thriller with a jaw-dropping finale atop the Statue of Liberty.
44267|1|A shrewdly constructed narrative and strong lead performances make up for much -- including Bier's irritating penchant for shoving her handheld camera in her cast's faces.
22889|0|An awful teen horror comedy.
13125|0|Despite the appealing supporting performers, I'd like to cap this movie.
6899|1|A freewheeling comedy-thriller with the gift of the gab.
15588|0|Ultimately its refusal to tackle any real issues makes this a thoroughly bland American comedy.
77187|1|Well-acted and deftly written and directed.
59880|1|This was Robert Hamer's masterpiece...
6766|1|Convoluted though this plot may seem, at least the inventive visuals from Gangster No 1 director Paul McGuigan keep you engrossed.
57850|0|For his character being such a die-hard Cubs fan, [Lance] Bass throws a baseball like an 8-year-old girl.
52803|0|While portions of the film do work pretty well, you can't help but wonder how much of an improvement a little variation would have had on the entire project.
1264|0|It was darker and murkier, and I didn't enjoy spending time with the characters, as I had on Friday nights more than ten years ago.
27872|0|this competent study of a baseball player going wacko is interesting enough for a one-time rental
24092|1|"Not content to merely direct traffic of intersecting characters, Mira Nair never lets the scurrying ensemble lag or their stories flag. ""Monsoon Wedding"" is one of the most culturally savory, joyously exotic comedies since ""Strictly Ballroom."""

74191|1|Like the original, Shrek 2 remains exceptional value for money for all age groups and essential winter viewing.
43059|0|It's a hodge-podge of Enter The Dragon and Blades Of Glory, yet infinitely worse than either. In short, a film about bouncing balls with the bounce of an anvil.
34000|1|Because the story is so entirely straightforward, the beauty is more in the performances and in the subtle touches than in the journey itself.
26479|0|It's amazing how such a brilliant opening film can devolve into nothing but uninteresting fight scenes and unnecessary visual effects.
53377|0|A featherweight that might well blow right off the screen were it not anchored in place by a few darker undercurrents.
10887|1|Godard's self-reflexive meditation about love, marriage, and filmmaking is a masterpiece, which among other things, proves that sex symbol Brigitte Bardot could act.
1860|1|The X-Files 2: I Want to Believe isn't a groundbreaking film by any stretch %u2014 but that it challenges the viewer to consider certain moral imperatives in a season devoted to films revolving around explosions and fart jokes makes it a daring pie
76199|0|No doubt extensive market research shows that there's an audience out there for movies like Son Of The Mask, but it's too depressing to speculate who that might be.
8719|1|A very good film, regardless of whether or not you love Ray Charles' music. And even if it was a lesser film, Jamie Foxx's performance would have made it worth watching.
11723|1|The special effects suggest a Narnia-like romp, but the movie has a darker, more sorrowful landscape to explore and it does so brilliantly, with true nuance and heartfelt sincerity.
76627|1|Beneath its girlie trappings...this is a movie with many traditional virtues.
2975|1|Contains enough belly-laughs and sly jokes to become one of the bigger crowd-pleasers of the fall.
46745|0|Not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination.
16395|1|Tasteful and seductive.
76761|1|With its molelike inhabitants, its sprawling war between flesh-eaters and lentil-men, its achingly sweet love story and surrealist blend of dusty antiquities and 21st-century gizmos, Delicatessen is indescribably wild.
67060|1|The movie is crafty work and very much a show. In one way or another, right down to the percussively abrupt open ending, it's all about being hammered.
4473|1|It's easy to imagine what My Left Foot might have looked like in the hands of a lesser director like, say, Ron Howard.
10891|0|Inappropriate for audiences of all ages.
9345|1|Characterisation, always a hit and miss affair in To's films, is deliberately rather thin. Instead, To and his cinematographer, Cheng Siu Keung, make the greasy, near-abandoned streets of the Hong Kong capital come alive

74915|0|Its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this isn't something to be taken seriously, but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare.
5402|1|Space Jam isn't exactly a slam dunk. It's more of a graceful tip-in by Michael Jordan, with a snazzy assist by Bugs Bunny.

9140|0|The movie would perhaps like to say something serious about the ease with which modern communications allows us to be multiple personalities, but that effort is lost in ineptitude.
54887|0|A garish and poorly filmed chop-socky frolic that makes about as much sense as an Escher painting viewed through Vaseline-smudged Ray-Bans.
5443|1|Rains, with his silky, slightly superior-sounding voice, emerges as pathetic not grandiose, and the film clips along with boundless energy.
79285|1|A compulsively watchable if distorted history lesson
19535|1|Not quite good enough to jump out of the pack of Asian swordplay movies but is too well crafted to sink into utter anonymity.
73535|0|Limiting the gore, but not the carnage, in pursuit of a PG-13 rating and more youngsters, pic remains a cluttered, nasty exercise that seems principally intent on selling action figures.
38057|0|...a thriller that's woefully lacking in thrills...
15238|0|Despite its G-rating, the movie includes numerous scenes of animals in peril, including a pit bull that nearly hangs himself, a crippled dog that gets thrown into a wall and a goldfish that almost suffocates... Happy holidays, kids!
39658|1|Love's Labour's Lost wasn't lost on me at all; if I could float into the air, singing 'Cheek to Cheek' with total, unabashed sincerity, I probably would.
60930|1|The reputation of this intriguing cult item far exceeds the Trivial Pursuit tidbits that it was a personal favorite of Francois Truffaut and that Martin Scorsese was the original director until he was fired 10 days into production.
45316|1|Evokes a palpable sense of disconnection, made all the more poignant by the incessant use of cell phones.
4360|0|I can't think of a single kind word to say about this unfortunate family comedy which is unoriginal, predictable, schmaltzy and bland.
58400|1|Director Betty Thomas recruited a host of stand-up comedians to provide the voices for the animals, and it's a gimmick that works astonishingly well. Talking animals have never sounded so witty.
201|1|Howard Hawks and Cary Grant made several famous films together but it's a shame this one is often overlooked since it's a true comic gem that works well on every level.
61833|1|A Disney animation classic for all ages and all times.

67490|1|Briski doesn't merely document the children's milieu. Instead, she does something revolutionary: She empowers them to document it for themselves.
20630|1|Considering the show, though still funny, has seen better years, it s everything you could expect from a Simpsons movie manic and smart, not quite days of fire and vim, but like a visit with a dear old friend.
41566|1|Something to Talk About is the kind of movie where you start out wondering how all of these people are related, and end up knowing all too well.
27040|1|Far more successful at the gambler's rush than Matt Damon's schoolboy lessons in Rounders, Croupier is worth taking a chance on.
42647|1|I found it pretty entertaining, as well as provocative in some of its comments about contemporary life.
58856|0|While Buffalo Soldiers has its moments, it stumbles along the way and fumbles the ending.
49708|1|Still entertaining drama, though dated, starring Bartholomew and Rooney, two great child actors of the time.
64633|1|Think of this movie as a glorified home video rather than a bitingly insightful documentary. But for Garcia and Grisman, this soft-shoe approach couldn't be more appropriate.

6203|1|a story that's less like fiction and more like the way that families (and countries) actually age.

28779|1|Reed's memorable and epic musical provides good family fun, some great musical numbers and in Fagin, the Artful Dodger, and Sykes, some of cinema's most beloved unsavoury characters.
80159|0|Since the filmmakers had no access to the private self as expressed in Plath's body of work, Sylvia is limited to her public life, which was her death. The result feels like art imitating life, once removed.
2271|1|An Absolutely riveting movie...Pitt is outstanding
42476|1|The jokes aren't a match for Pixar's best, and there's too much sentimentality (as if Lasseter were determined to keep Disney's cartoons just that little bit less cool than Pixar's), but this is still an above-average children's film.
16647|0|So very little works in She's Having a Baby that it's easiest just to grouse on how petty and little-minded and pro-conformity it is.
74388|1|"If ""Mad Max"" embraced a geneticist's acumen and ""The Road Warrior"" a philosopher's spirit, ""Thunderdome"" is about cold, hard economics - not just in Bartertown's transactions but the market expectations that come with the receipt of studio funding."
16165|1|You have to love a movie in which a little white rabbit literally jumps off the page to excite a writer's imagination, or winks at her to encourage her dreams.
60255|1|"""Rocco and His Brothers"" is a film both authentic and ambitious, a classic that is as adept at telling individual stories as it is in drawing larger parallels from them."
5171|0|Once the cat is out of the bag, the movie turns rip-roaring awful in an entirely enjoyable way.
3852|0|Truly offensive is the film's go-nowhere result, its purported liberal ideologies untapped beyond their potential for speedy, soulless entertainment.

34774|1|Hilarious Woody Allen comedy of dubbing.
43232|1|In comparison with most of the Indian cinema that breaks through to the Western mainstream, Bandit Queen stands out for its political attitude and willingness to take on Hollywood sensibilities in its storytelling.
33959|0|Maybe a better idea would have been to have Trixie and Frances McDormand's Fargo cop start a detective agency.
79775|1|What makes Canary sing is Leni's pioneering mix of spooky expressionism and light comedy, fabulous camera work, and nice turns from Laura La Plante, Creighton Hale, and Martha Mattox.

59902|1|Director Frank Coraci plays fast and loose with Jules Verne's classic tome Around The World In 80 Days, but his adaptation never runs out of gas.
37738|1|Though a classic rags to riches saga, this biopic of Loretta Lynn doesn't fall victim to cliches, and benefits immensely from the astonishingly authentic turn from Sissy Spacek, who does her own singing; even real-life singer Lynn liked the picture

2874|0|This is one of those untaxing time-killers where you spend a lot of time pondering which of its actress's changing hairstyles you like best.
50190|0|Instead of the promised lighthearted tone of the TV series, the big screen update avails itself of its PG-13 liberties and comes stuffed with a barnful of profanity and enough marijuana references to satisfy even the most stoned out Cheech and Chong fan.

42956|1|In a holiday season characterized by heavy cinematic fare, Stephen Spielberg has concocted a frothy trifle.
3396|1|As it recounts the history of N.W.H., the film also manages to lampoon rap music and its archetypes, as well as poking fun at the venal, self-serving music-business types looking to grab easy money from the scene.

19238|0|The screenplay is immature at best, although with some cutting and embellishing, it might have been a far better entry into the genre.
17157|1|A lot of fun and an OK end to the studio's glory days.
63784|0|The end result is a movie that would have been better off eschewing its comedic aspirations in order to tell a serious story, which Hanson and Duvall have more than proven they're capable of.

10481|1|It is destined for greatness.
50953|0|Low-budget quickie is insulting even within its own no-effort parameters.

20133|0|It has moments of sweetness, but not enough poignancy or wit to turn it into the endearing art-house comedy that it aspires to be.
10500|1|Even Daryl Hall would have to admit this is one of the finest animated features committed to film, produced and packaged during Walt Disney's ballsiest years of control.
9604|1|Undoubtedly flawed, Freaks is also admirably bonkers and quite simply unforgettable.
36215|0|There also are too many collage sequences indicating time shifts. The first two or three are interesting; after that they become dizzying, and finally downright annoying.

29177|1|Stands alone as a wonderful horror thriller.
22464|1|Primary Colors is one of the best film about politics I have ever seen and is director Mike Nichols best film since The Graduate, 31 years ago.
68221|0|A cynical and manipulative exercise with little feel for the teen culture it purports to celebrate.
71245|1|It is in the best tradition of animation: an ideal tale for children that offers a lot to adults as well.
47794|1|John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are terrific as talkative hit men, and Bruce Willis is equally good as a boxer who refuses to throw a fight.
76215|0|Two of the screenwriters, Steve Zacharias and Jeff Buhai, also wrote Revenge of the Nerds, so it's not surprising that they're more interested in tame teen-age fantasies than in social satire.

1498|1|Has some honest laughs ... but it also spawned Ernest's movie career. Call it a toss-up.

53409|1|Possibly the first mainstream Chinese representation of the massacre at Tiannamen Square.

40359|1|This picture is a total smash.
38114|0|Hysterically inept attempt at action filmmaking

76025|1|Grim but really good.

15615|1|Capably but too coyly directed by the aged Henry Hathaway.
12125|1|Elf is a Christmas comedy that's as sweet-natured and goofily amusing as its title character.
62726|1|There is humor but it's too sane and too safe to qualify the film for an eccentric midnight movie
9527|1|The film's plainness, and the understated force of van der Groen and Petersen's performances, sharpen its complexity of feeling until all mawkishness is cut away.
81009|1|Super MGM spectacular, Roman style, headlining Robert Taylor.
3716|1|Aldrich's film is a timeless classic with a bevy of super performances.

81080|1|An entertaining add-on to an entertaining show.
22388|0|"It should have been called ""My Boss's House"" because there was very little focus on the boss's hot daughter."
18349|0|The film's premise is thinner than the heroine's G-string.
67720|1|Imagine a live-action version of Dilbert, or In the Company of Men reconceived as a lighthearted romp, and you get the idea of Office Space, the auspicious live-action debut of Mike Judge.
37605|1|American filmmakers have [again] hammered something beautiful down into unremarkable mush. Still, it honors marriage more than any film in recent memory.
22356|1|The Thin Man was an entertaining novel, and now it's an entertaining picture.
27797|1|There are certain things audiences have come to expect from the plots of motion pictures, and even in 2014, L'avventura feels angry and fresh because it upends those expectations gleefully. Being anti-plot doesn't necessarily mean that its plotless.

57036|0|It has some worthy moments, but it could have been so much more.
55077|0|Van Sant's refusal to delve into his subject in anything but an abstract way renders the movie pointless and frustrating -- a lyrical, lovely tone poem, signifying little.
12648|1|A heartwarming feast for adults. May bore kids.
51408|0|The mystery here is not the identity of the shadowy man who got Zoe into this mess, but which movie Taylor intended to emerge from Cherish's cinematic muddle.
2205|1|. . .a fever dream of a film that is haunting, capable of jarring moments of revelation about the timelessness of human nature. . .
66157|1|Tenacious D and the Pick of Destiny is diverting and fun and a great treat for fans, but it's as forgettable as Chinese dinner at the nursing home.
47883|0|It's fun to see the characters get eaten up. It's the people who remain alive and talking that may disturb the viewer.
52931|1|a lovely gift to deprived Futurama fans
44899|1|As usual, Lee tries many kinds of stylistic effects and uses wall-to-wall music (by Aaron Copland and Public Enemy); what's different this time is how personally driven the story feels.

7921|1|Classic feminist film
66340|0|Gone are Ritchie's style and wit. Gone is the mischievous sense of fun that pervaded his other films. Here instead are drudgery and inanity.

7125|0|While not exactly a gift-wrapped present, it's safe to say that Flock will certainly appeal to television cop drama junkies and those who love to see Claire Danes cry, which would now include every film she's ever made.
52555|1|There's plenty of grandstanding, most of it very funny. And in this instance, all that sizzle is selling the steak.
9438|1|...a fun, well-paced slasher...
56029|1|This 2005 story about a Russian boy whose mother has given him up may be derivative, but it's still engrossing, largely because of its appealing juvenile lead, Kolya Spiridonov.

13542|1|While the premise sounds more like a Charles Dickens tragedy than a comedy, it becomes a delight in such capable hands.

9736|0|Connoisseurs of the show likely relish the induced awkwardness and off-kilter rhythms of the piece; a good part of its appeal was the blank and baffled looks it induced in the uninitiated.

31264|1|A powerful and unpredictable film.
48556|1|This witty, sharply observed tale belnds sports, comedy and romance and benefits immensely from the appealing performances by Kevin Costner, Susan Sarandon, and Tim Robbins.

11177|0|Unlike Franco's mop, no amount of teasing can keep this romance from falling flat.
5953|1|Most notable for its effortless shifts in tone, starting out as a charming comedy before segueing into a melodrama ... and finally erupting as a deeply affecting tragedy capped by a redemptive ending.
18370|0|Tying up the psychological loose ends of a movie that promised so much more, the trite ending subscribes to the bogus therapeutic notion that one good cry and a confession of vulnerability can wipe away a lifetime of repression.
57494|0|Well-acted but essentially go-nowhere little movie.
76930|1|"The only real ""cerebral"" activity that should take place in a zombie movie is the consumption of brains by the heretofore mentioned zombies themselves."
73508|0|Although Michael Dinner's direction is noticeably better than the material, the film aims consistently for the lowest common denominator.
9471|1|Harrowing and truly gripping despite an obviously paltry budget.
13189|1|For obvious reasons it's not really an actors' film, but it would add up to less than it does without the heroic contributions of an extraordinary cast, which includes the directors Shinya Tsukamoto and Sabu.
77666|1|A penetrating emotional analysis of the boxing which is nothing short of inspired.

38779|0|If Civil Brand works ... as an updated women's prison melodrama with a strong whisper of political consciousness, there are some crippling flaws in the film.
72942|1|This was the most expensive animated film to date, and every penny was on the screen.
73454|0|Shallcross fails to infuse the proceedings with the wit or distinctiveness necessary to lift it above the crop of its so many similar-themed predecessors.
18017|1|Fabulously cast and wickedly witty.
14824|0|The entire production bears a certain medicinal scent; it may be good for you, but it's not exactly tasty.
20400|1|For his sheer muscular verve and ambition, Lee deserves a standing ovation.
17015|1|simple paint-by-the numbers gay themed film that strikes directly at Mormon dogma, but it has a certain charm due mainly to Sandvoss' Herculean efforts
21554|1|Chaplin is the apotheosis of the world's despised and downtrodden, and also their hope; he heralds a revolution in anarchic beauty.
7256|1|Words seldom intrude on the sight gags that range from elegant to acrobatic, and the collective directors exhibit the rare bravery to let a static camera linger to crank comic tension.

39953|1|Dutcher the director gets good performances from his largely local cast, which includes Dutcher the actor, who makes a very sympathetic lead.
18711|1|In the Cut seemed better by its end than it did in its beginning, it seemed creepier the next morning...and its power only increased on a second viewing.
679|0|This is a prime example of a movie that isn't bad, per se, just unnecessary, a competently made but wholly unremarkable trifle.
24038|0|in the end, with a character that repellent and a message so heavy handed, there is no need to commit ourselves to this bitter, merciless film.

50029|0|The acting here is weaker than the slender story, but intermingled with all the silliness are some fine performances of McCartney-Beatle standards as well as three new songs.
47406|0|Doesn't fare very well as a work of cinema, but if you take it as a fictionalised History channel documentary, you might find it compelling.
56695|0|When you wrap a movie around a gimmick, the wrapping better be taut and engaging or the gimmick falls flat.
9506|1|The plot is typical fluff -- Kelly and Sinatra join Esther Williams's baseball team at the turn of the century -- but the production values are, as always, worth the price of admission.
64572|1|The music, the chemistry between Houston and Washington, and minor characters that make us smile make this film worth watching-especially around Christmas, when this is set.

58983|1|Siegel makes excellent use of San Francisco locations, even if Harry makes a few implausible leaps across town from time to time. The Kezar Stadium showdown in particular is a keeper.
9442|1|Gives us a working relationship in progress rather than the usual Hollywood sitcom.
29723|0|Gaslight ultimately adds up to very little in the psychological mind-**** department.
48631|1|Hard as it is to justify Bond films on intellectual grounds, there's something invigorating -- and strangely reassuring -- about this sort of picture.
36943|0|Some explosions, a lot of techno, two X-Men, and a Sweat-hog.
52315|1|A fascinating and eccentric character study, and study of unconventional relationships fueled by fetish...
42259|1|Unpretentious fun from a soon-to-be-great director
9793|1|Poignant without being heavy, Prisoner of the Mountains is insightful and even magical in spots, rather than grandiose as American war pictures (even one about POWs) tend to be.
3432|0|Filled with 'hilarious' scenes of people being vomited on and falling off roofs, Four Holidays tries to meld nasty, black-hued comedy with warm sentiment, resulting in a sick melange of treacle and malice.
18106|1|The sort of movie that would probably appeal to Ryan Reynolds' detractors . . .
18169|1|We just haven't had too many films that concentrate on this story.
1272|1|A gilt-edged, no-messing, accept-no-substitutes masterpiece.
11261|1|Cameron is genuinely compelling as Caleb, a work-obsessed firefighter on the verge of divorce from his neglected wife.
74581|0|A lot of loving care (but not much thought) went into this white elephant, and considering how fascinating a figure Chaplin is it's never exactly boring, but your time would be much better spent looking at any of Chaplin's pictures.

12606|1|Italian prog rockers Goblin's tingling, rasping, throbbing score [and] Argento's constantly gliding camera creates an almost unbearable sense of unease and suspense.
78359|1|Ranges from laugh-out-loud hilarious to wonder-what- time-it-is tedious.
26419|1|Directed, co- written and narrated by Scorsese, it's a deeply personal love letter to Italian cinema -- to his family, to the power of film to illuminate and change our lives.
57654|0|Think Billy Elliot, Flashdance and The Full Monty, and then say ugh!
8539|1|The film is sprinkled with a bit of humor right up to the charming end when we realize that this is a movie about the strangest things some of us will do for love.
22599|1|[W]hat may take the jaded viewer aback is the amount of time [Tony Scott] dedicates to character development before heading down the inevitable trail of bloody revenge.

3714|1|Certainly nothing brilliant, but King fans may find something to enjoy.
63602|0|It's a senseless, tasteless and demented postmodern noir that has about as much class as a gimpy $10 Times Square hooker.
58459|1|Although it works on two levels, one thing makes it work for any age: the sense of the id unloosed.
14905|1|One of the greatest cops-and-crooks films ever made, High and Low is a combination of immensely powerful psychodrama and exquisitely detailed police procedural.

43490|0|Not as bad as legend has it, but Francis Ford Coppola's film of Finian's Rainbow can hardly be called good
78871|1|Pryor hits the comedy running and doesn't let up until he's exhausted the audience with so much gut-wrenching laughter that you won't know whether to stand up or lie down.
6612|0|The plotting is too complex for a generally stupid picture, but that didn't stop me from getting sucked in by director Breck Eisner's nicely paced action sequences.
33107|1|Spielberg creates an alien invasion movie that can be labelled the antithesis to the likes of Independence Day or the ilk. The reason? The personal perspective.
31651|1|Earnest and often moving account of one man's struggle for redemption
67941|0|Vardalos is a much better actress than she is a writer, and the patchy script has a desperate, thrown-together feeling to it, as if she had to scramble to come up with something after Wedding's gargantuan success.
24596|1|Very good, but slowish and slightly high-minded.
67160|1|...a well-made and heartfelt drama that's just not as engrossing as it should be.
37173|1|This twisty yarn is meant to leave you as discombobulated as its hero, an innocent man on the run from cops, thugs and killers. Hitchcock would have liked seeing him squirm.
77491|1|It's a promising debut made even better by an impressive bunch of actors.
27816|1|Emotionally stings like few other westerns.
66374|1|Foster displays a great touch in her directorial debut
61907|0|Director Mark Pellington hardly lets a moment pass without suggesting some bad vibes creeping onto the edges of the screen, but he's let down by Richard Hatem's script.

52041|1|A welcome addition to the genre.
61325|0|Reeve continues his traditions of graceful flying moves, confident carriage, and twinkly warmth. Sadly, none of it is enough to save Superman III from being at home only in a junkyard.
28895|1|The strangely planet-bound James Bond plot unfolds just like you'd suspect, only slower.
75198|0|A wanna-be event movie that merely reinvents the wheel.
7146|1|It delivers in the shoot-'em-up mentality, not to be taken seriously but a fun thing to watch on a Saturday afternoon.
47779|0|There was reportedly a great deal of argument and dissent during the making of the film, and it is reflected in its erratic tone and slovenly, indecisive and increasingly incoherent narrative.
13002|1|Here everything leads up to (and wilts after) Horrocks' showstopper. But she is amazing. Absolutely fabulous.
73595|0|A fun, fairly crisp opening hour gives way to a muddled, entirely unsatisfying ending.
78983|1|The body count is high, the running time is particularly long for a children's film, and the themes are fairly heavy. But, like Wardrobe, it's a lush and mostly entertaining production.
9288|1|One of Bullock's best - has as much byte as it does bang
40972|1|The film puts a delightful spin on that profound and solipsistic idea that we are the godlike inventors, and moral arbitrators, of our own little worlds. A gem.
61866|1|This horror flick about young campers stalked and slaughtered by gruesome backwoods barbarians is a fairly decent crossbreeding of Friday the 13th and Deliverance.
4593|0|The leading contender for worst film of the year.
36927|0|Too pointless to be artsy and too decorous to be sexy.
52309|1|[Shane] Meadows' fictionalized version of these events is at least as vivid -- and at times as hard to watch -- as some of Ken Loach's more stark dramas.
21548|0|Not quite as bad as I thought it was going to be. The original was downright awful.
5756|1|Korine falls so thoroughly in love with many of his images, including his opening shot, that he stretches them out in hypnotic slow motion.
46508|1|Fun and entertaining -- a good time.
32850|1|By its second half, Supercop cranks up into such an extravaganza of fighting, blowing things up, spin-kicking, punch throwing and death-defying that it all but takes your breath out of your lungs and packs it up for shipment to Hong Kong.
43056|1|It can be described as manipulative, derivative and heavy-handed. In spite of all that, it kinda works in a populist-fantasy sort of way.
17872|1|It contains more than a few laughs, and Ferrell and Shannon are comedic actors destined for greatness.
35448|1|There is something to get excited about in this third chapter of the Mad Max series: the powerhouse presence of Tina Turner.
71713|0|...the movie's theatrical origins remain obvious throughout, both in the dialogue and direction.
43776|1|Fun spin on the Greek myths despite its general goofiness
27098|1|Despite Cacoyannis' plodding helming, and schematic contrast between the inhibited Brit and lusty Greek, the film is enjoyable due to Anthony Quinn's performance and Theodorakis' glorious music.

28896|0|River Phoenix gives a somnambulant impersonation of Christian Slater impersonating Jack Nicholson, and Samantha Mathis spends much of the movie trying to figure out exactly who her character is.
31984|1|the film is a highly satisfying mix of satire and suspense
46302|0|It isn't pleasant to watch a talented filmmaker like John Carpenter willfully distort his personality to fit a commercial (read Spielbergian) profile, and only the opening suspense-horror sequences have the weight of real involvement.

69151|1|A low-key tale of corrupt cops that recalls the gritty police procedurals of the 70s.

38938|1|Rich look at romantic lives of everyday Japanese, with a profound lesbian subtext.
71978|1|It may start off as a lighthearted, excess-filled, party-road-trip movie, but Depp is reigned in a little towards the end as his character (a stand-in for Thompson) poetically bemoans the sad failure of the late-60s ideals and values.

54703|1|Ten Canoes is a celebration of the art of storytelling, and of the power of stories to transcend all barriers of space, time and language. This is a movie with sheer magic in it.
13437|1|As impeccably shot as its subject deserves, the film is more accessible than most of Rivette's work, with characteristically playful passing nods to the relationship between life and performance.

76995|1|It's difficult to call a movie this light and insubstantial a classic, but it's as likeable as ever more than two decades after its initial release.
67908|1|A rich and elegant drama.
617|0|Light entertainment is all about playing to an audience's fantasy. There have been quite a few well-crafted and entertaining films that have started the same way and gotten away with it, out of sheer creativity. Jumper is not one of those films.
70244|0|Blood Diamond is a movie zircon. It doesn't cut glass, but it cuts plot, character, and credibility. It could be Hotel Rwanda, but instead it's Motel Deep-Six.
41862|1|The actors give performances of intense naturalness.
19133|1|Connery and Pfeiffer are excellent, but much of the film's pleasure comes from watching consummate pros filling out the roles of various bureaucrats, among them James Fox, Roy Scheider and director Ken Russell (looking like Bernie Sanders with bedhead).
6812|0|Not one of Hill's better efforts.
79942|0|The film's approach to violence is unflinching: this is what poor people are doing to each other with the guns the West sells them, it screams -- but there's no suggestion it might be stopped, or slowed.
64488|1|This fourth chapter comes off as the first fully postmodern Alien film: not Alien multiplied or cubed, but synthetically reawakened, groggy enough to sleepwalk through our memories of the first three, as in a dream.

49220|1|Unwanted guests have a benefit: They can remind us of our own dislikes and vulnerabilities, and help us come to terms (or not) with them.
72839|0|There's a delicious irony to the way in which this supposedly heartwarming comedy gives the impression of having itself been devised by a race of extra-terrestrials with only a tentative grasp of what constitutes heart or humour.
15543|1|It reminds us that flat, colorless character actors look really flat and colorless when sharing a scene with Price.
9586|1|An odd amalgam of kitschy, transparently manipulative sentiment, provocative subject matter, off-kilter perspective and some truly funny physical humor.

75616|1|Burt Reynolds does what he's best at in a lightweight rom-com with some good one-liners, but it's the parodies of the self-improvement culture that really make the film watchable.

31035|1|Walking a fine line between genuinely emotional and overly sentimental, it evokes the magic of moviegoing in post-WWII Italy through the intimate bond between a young boy and his mentor-projectionist, splendidly played by Philippe Noiret.
43653|1|Something like an avant-garde telling of the myth of Eros and Psyche.
21728|1|A very welcome rerelease of Demy's delightful 1967 musical.

53918|0|Joe Roth steps back into the director's chair after nearly a decade and AMERICA'S SWEETHEARTS suffers the same diffused focus that his earlier efforts. After the tightly-paced opening, the film flounders until all the major players have been introduced.
8558|0|It's A Hard Day's Night all over again, except nobody has bothered to write the brothers some funny dialogue.
51936|0|It was much funnier when we didn't see Stuart's family. And, if we have to see them, it would have been much funnier if they were strait-laced '50s sitcom types.

13436|1|Spielberg's films never lack a certain degree of narrative and visual force, but his tendency toward sentimentality, a strictly antipodal, Good-vs.-Bad conception of character, and an insensitivity to structure have consistently marred his work...

9506|1|Internal Affairs is, for the dim movie season that is traditionally January, an unusually bright light.
57997|1|All the actors do perform excellently in their roles, but the star here is the director Tom Tykwer. The layering of the imagery, soundtrack, and the pacing all come together to outshine any performance by a single actor.
75276|1|With the right attitude this cheerfully calculated effort to update the old girl for a tween market can be enjoyed in all its endearing awfulness, as a loony High School Musical with posher accents and a lot more going on upstairs.

13197|1|The mystery requires a lot of concentration, but the stunning final scene is ample reward. Not just an indulgence, the ingenious structure makes the point that memory, although unreliable, is what we depend upon for our sense of reality.

27654|1|It's a complex, often depressing film, but the stories are knitted together seamlessly, and Manchevski paints a grim picture of how war ruins the lives of ordinary people more than anybody's.
39660|0|Its elements are actually quite typical of a syndicated cartoon series, aimed mostly at the young'uns and contributing pretty much nothing to the Star Wars mythos.
14007|1|Could've been a classic belch of grindhouse-throwback foolishness if not for Carnahan's apparent need to take his story seriously after all.

19696|1|A classic that is beautifully restored to life, successfully mixing lightness and humour in a dark film that would even have Frankenstein's monster running for cover.
5627|0|The movie Ed Wood, about the worst director of all time, was made to prepare us for Stargate.

6635|0|Fluff at best, but buckets and buckets of blood for those that care about such things.
11061|1|The Last Detail is one superbly funny, uproariously intelligent performance, plus two others that are very, very good, which are so effectively surrounded by profound bleakness that it seems to be a new kind of anti-comedy.
15854|1|It must be nerve-racking for the producers to offer a tale so lacking in standard melodramatic satisfactions. But the result is worth it, for this is the clearest film statement yet on how the nature of heroism has changed in this totalitarian century.

38200|1|Touching the Void leaves you emotionally and physically spent, and grateful it was only a movie, not a mountain, you had to endure.
16610|0|The resulting caricaturish effect, coupled with a story line that repeats its basics over and over again for more than two hours, damage this potentially droll look at ungoverned urges and tyke tyranny beyond salvaging.

15812|1|Jeong's evocative visuals of the urban landscape and her savvy deployment of appliances only deepens the resemblance such stories have to our own lives.
6905|0|Terrible messages about relationships. Ed Burns is a mysoginist. But some laughs, could be worse.

9502|0|All the other ingredients, including Miss Russell's famed physique, are pretty much the same as have been tumbled into previous cheesecakes with Jane and Bob.
37030|1|The writer-director-star is so aggressively 'alternative' that she'll have the Gyllenhaals diving for cover, however her peculiar handle on humanity proves quite engaging.
4258|0|Basically a one-joke farce that plays around with a once-delicate subject that by now is a mainstay even on TV.
11527|1|A unique survival film, that has become a cult favorite.
6414|1|If you don't love it, I have to wonder what brings you to movies in the first place.
55526|1|Yeboah is so levelheaded about his own accomplishments that the swelling score and emotional narration from Oprah Winfrey feel embarrassingly sentimental.

38443|0|Stephen King pits kids vs. killer clown from hell.
43294|0|Bride Of Chucky, the fourth film in the Child's Play series, plays like an unfunny and corny parody of the first three films.
71835|1|Number Five is the real star of this energetic film. Sheedy, Guttenberg and company are just supporting players.
18885|1|The young British writer and director Christopher Nolan, who has every intention of putting us through the mill, doubles his fun by running the whole story backward.

57846|1|A fitting end to one of the most enjoyable fantasy series of the 1980s.
15605|1|It's a genuine delight and a definite thumbs aloft for kids of about six upwards.
20423|1|While it has the appearance of a made-for-TV weepie, it's well-acted, technically proficient, a solid story with genuine, credible emotions.
29789|0|"Call it ""the Sundance effect,"" in which sentimental family drama blossoms amid a scenic, pastoral American landscape, with all its connotations of unspoiled purity and rejuvenation."
20549|1|This film gives one vision of what anarchy is like, on a small scale, at least.
27138|1|Simmers down into a reasonably smart little thriller with a moral conscience, yet.
36412|0|This is the kind of monstrously overgrown commercial movie that depends entirely on the microscopic pleasures of having one`s most routine expectations fulfilled.
46985|1|A new and different kind of cinematic mythmaking.

44727|1|A morally specious but undeniably efficient brainstem-tickler -- the most effective action/revenge thriller in years.
3473|0|The silliness of The Substitute escalates as the film progresses, so that by the end there have been plenty of laughs during 'serious' scenes.
41840|1|Clark Gable reprises his role from Fleming's 1932 adventure in this colorful and enjoyable remake by John Ford, featuring great performances by Ava Gardner and Grace Kelly

3937|1|As always, Waters works with an unmistakable affection for even his grubbiest characters.
13945|1|Glossy, star packed drama with Holden in top form.
2251|0|Ridiculous from start to finish. Connery, Harris, and Fishburne couldn't have wasted their time in a less productive fashion.
60966|0|Brian Gibson, who directed the script by Kate Lanier, seems to have trouble taking charge of his material as he skips through the years.
59746|1|Slither is a monster movie with a wry smile on its face, where (thankfully) the gruesome effects, rather than the humour, tend towards full on gross out.
32298|1|With its universal themes, Kingdom Come offers a great deal to enjoy, from its stellar cast to its entertaining screenplay
59559|1|Perhaps the director's best-known and best-liked film.
33743|1|inventive and rough around the edges
2500|1|A movie for people who are sophisticated enough to know how shameless the film is, but fun-loving enough to enjoy its excesses and manic zeal.
16549|1|For some reason, this film feels rushed through, like the conventional animation pictures are becoming a kind of filler between the computer-animated Pixar releases.
1240|1|It's just gunfights strung together, without a whisper of coherence or meaning.
26827|1|Like the rest of the film, Diane Lane is smart, pretty and charming in the most classical of senses.

31631|1|Director Gore Verbinski maintains a consistently unsettling mood and look to the film, even if the story often falls by the wayside.
70486|1|If you can't sit back and enjoy an entertaining popcorn flick like The Boondock Saints, then you'll probably never understand the difference between the movies and real life.
3600|1|An irresistible attraction that should be viewed on the biggest screen you can find.
59153|0|I imagine if I were a woman, this movie would receive a very favorable review. However, I'm just a fat guy from Ohio.
46834|0|A half-baked comedy without a heart.
9391|1|This movie gets its charge not from action pyrotechnics but from its electric barrage of language, wisecracks and dialogue, from the mordant '70s classicism of its long-take camera style and its smart, offbeat, strangely sexy cast.
14872|1|A beautifully made, unapologetically artistic piece of work.
3752|0|Depressingly witless.
48949|1|As with Step into Liquid, Brown proves in Dust to Glory that the thrill of high-speed racing can be shared by fans and non-fans alike.
23449|0|The less welcome news is that most of the same shortcomings that cramped the first installment are still dogging the sequel, which delivers on action but dawdles through downtime.
24901|0|While the movie deals with the issues of single parenthood in a believable manner, director John N. Smith's handling borders on pedestrian.
8609|1|Richard Farnsworth brilliantly embodies a man who combines cantankerousness, tenacity and wisdom.
4352|1|Yankee fan or not, this is a great film.
3577|1|The French have no equal when it comes to perfectly aligned bottom-kicking, showing revulsion at the ill-breeding of others, or performing semi-socialist slapstick.
48152|0|A movie for kids, by kids, even if Rodriguez was there for a little bit of technical supervision.
80620|0|All in all, a pretty thin comedy.
1230|0|Good music. Sick imagery.

61702|1|A yo-ho-wholesome retread of Disney favorites.
23992|1|Yes. Johnny Depp is again hilarious as Capt. Jack Sparrow. Yes. Keira Knightley is fetching in period duds. And, yes, Orlando Bloom is in fine swashbuckling form.
44280|0|Welcome--now get out.
66273|0|There's more than a little of the school pageant in the rhythm of the movie: Though it's all neater than our school drama coaches could make it, the figures group and say their assigned lines and move on.
16275|1|Everything described in the film is authentic.
37431|0|Mistrust a movie with too many close-ups of Bisto Kid children and doleful dogs: they suggest a director cleverly boxing his way out of some very tight script corners.

11265|1|I was pretty sure that I had heard everything that I wanted to hear about this 'unfortunate incident', but after watching this documentary, I realized that I was wrong - I want the truth.
1811|1|A wry, violent and surreally funny crime caper from British director Jonathan Glazer and screenwriters Louis Mellis and David Scinto.
10492|0|So overrated.
5976|1|The complexity of the plot has to do with the way Michel is changed by Harry.
7163|1|It stars Mann's favorite Western leading man James Stewart in an anti-hero role.
14136|1|It's a good thing this breezy animated adventure lasts only slightly more than 70 minutes. Children will no doubt enjoy its simple tale, but would probably grow restless if it went on for a minute longer.
75827|0|It becomes tiresome and runs out of gas way before the conclusion.
33759|1|An intriguing story about obsessive love
66485|1|Despite its hard-sell coming attraction and pot-smoking granny singing rock oldies, How to Make an American Quilt turns out to be a wealth of old-style Hollywood magic.
21463|0|Compelling idea, but slow, boring execution.
30315|0|...ultimately comes off as a well-intentioned failure that admittedly might hold some appeal for fans of the various actors...
30954|1|Less frightening than haunting, Murnau's film conjures a persistent atmosphere of dread and decay, thanks in part to Max Schreck's immortal performance as Orlok.
72607|0|Predictable, obvious, often silly.
17883|1|It is not boring, and looks fantastic, and maintains the wit and spirit of the original.
5566|1|Will remind parents of their own youth, and it will aid those living theirs out now to cope a little easier -- and that's just what a children's film should do.
46172|1|A rallying call to aid Darfur and an uplifting case study in the power of individuals to effect change.

15345|0|[A] dopey action movie featuring the contributions of people too talented to waste their time on something this risible.
6898|0|War may be Hell, but in this three-and-a-half-hour Civil War epic from Ronald Maxwell, the syrupy monologues and righteous Bible thumping provide the punishment.
12024|1|An appropriately strange beast-part moody, sex-saturated art film, and part slick genre fare.
59165|1|On the Town is so energetic and vital that the screen barely contains it.
72744|1|Rocking, warm, funny, touching and even heartbreaking. Just like Arthur.
73223|1|An atmospheric, tough-as-nails survival tale, and arguably Walter Hill's best movie overall. Well cast with a great Ry Cooder score. Packs a definite wallop.
67214|1|Warm and a little syrupy like old school films.
27462|0|...even the most avid Hitchcock fan will have a tough time embracing the film.
51184|1|It's heartening to see this non-Hollywood production finding a solid niche in the commercial movie circuit.
81652|0|There are few truly frightening moments in the film, little tension or real sense of menace, and the camp humor that is suggested in early scenes dissipates fairly quickly.
78402|1|Dated adult fare from 1969 with Benjamin and MacGraw.
16816|1|A psychological drama that registered with audiences and critics alike because of its heartfelt painful story.
11992|1|Today, it works well as a child's introduction to Dickens.
10031|0|Parts are nice, but it lacks an overall cohesiveness. The Interviewer segments don't work on any level.
22472|1|Echoes the mellow sensibilities of the TV series Northern Exposure.
3587|1|It's entertaining, well-written, slice-of-life stuff, but I'd rather spend 90 minutes with one of these stories than flit between several in a manner that does little to illuminate any of them.
9379|1|It calmly manages to pack in more complex emotions that most more histrionic films.
59694|1|this is a movie about Tokyo as much as it's a movie about three friends and a baby.
5056|0|...gets bloodier as it goes along, substituting close-up gore for horror, grossness for fright. (Unrated Edition)
54794|1|Will hopefully be appreciated years from now when the Iraq war is looked upon by many as a war that revealed to its citizens what America has truly become...
18340|1|There's a high enough feelgood factor here to compensate for the detours off the comedy highway.
72189|1|...gets off to a gangbusters start. And then Shakespeare butts in.
33731|1|Works much better as stage vehicle, but loaded with stars and laughs.
13171|0|A strong wire netting will keep out unwanted super-soaps such as the first, in which a black family in LA proves that being Afro-American is no inoculation against outbreaks of schmaltz and piety.
64616|1|This is a rather glossy confection, extremely well performed, in which everyone's problems are perfectly resolved.
2327|0|The American Dream as white, rich and all male.
11390|0|A cobbled-together mess of conflicting tones.
3169|1|Sensitively written and directed by Duncan Tucker, it's a moving, funny and involving story that takes us into the life of a transsexual who discovers that happiness is more than a nip and a tuck.
3112|1|A true original that kind of grows on you.
71975|0|...the characters here are so unlikable that it's hard to care what happens to them.
77931|1|A classic of faith and values.
25209|0|A movie that says we might as well pack it in as soon as we turn 18 is more bitter than bittersweet.
62021|0|An airy, accented romantic comedy romp of infidelity and animal attraction [that hinges on] your personal threshold for average, of-the-moment romantic comedies.
34729|1|A routine crime thriller that surprisingly adds some off-kilter punch to its run-of-the-mill psychological edginess.
38376|1|A four-hour French masterpiece about the creative process of an artist
20260|1|Ceylan orchestrates all the elements of his film into a gripping experience of manipulation and retribution, with an ironic final twist.
23267|0|Branagh's lame stab at a romantic psychological thriller makes no sense.
72847|1|Amazingly poignant performance by Peter Sellers.
3117|0|It's too bad that Shante and Keith are the movie's designated couple who must get back together, because the movie misses the opportunity to do something different.
27175|1|Kate Winslet, luscious in a brilliantly colored caftan and flushed from the heat of an African sun, makes a beautiful hippie, circa 1972, in Hideous Kinky.
54846|1|Nothing brilliant, but it's tough to knock Ridley Scott's style and Michael Douglas with a gun.
57613|1|An Astaire-Rogers movie where the film is very nearly as great as its stars.
39921|1|There is something brave and original about piling up most of our worst parental nightmares in one movie and then daring to make a midsummer comedy out of them. It really shouldn't work, but it does.
71590|1|[A] moody, insightful, and frequently funny film ...
5967|1|If Hopkins makes the story important, Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones make it sexy.
6684|1|The movie gets by largely on its guileless, upbeat charm, and on those same qualities as found in Abigail Breslin.
47070|0|There's something a little bit creepy and Dole-like about the notion that 35 years ago, everything was good and pure and right (except for that whole Cold War mess), while today, everything has become debased and confusing.
58323|1|Eventually wins us over, despite a hyperactive, amateurish filmmaking style
80897|1|It's a visually and aurally riveting trip to an important time from a perspective few here will know, about a person worth meeting.
12705|1|It's an extraordinarily affecting, personal, and at times uplifting tale.
26991|0|Simply an overblown East Coast copy of the original Muppet Movie.

9389|1|Fascinating and brutally realistic.

44684|1|The 1950 classic arrives on DVD for the first time with its charm enhanced and plenty of extras to delight fans of the fairytale.
20171|1|On the whole, Anna Karenina is a picture of merit. It is decorative, well-meaning, and full of neat encounters, and it certainly presents a Garbo in the high summer of her maturity, richer and more mellow than she has ever been before.

55172|0|The film's early affability eventually wears out, and a sharp turn into deadly seriousness feels out of place.
7273|1|Frankly, it's a pretty wretched story, but this small, cheap film has style to spare.
78078|0|Potter eschews drama for posing, politics for postulating, and provides enough symbolic broad strokes to gag a magic realist.
15126|0|A schizophrenic film that is never funny, never insightful and often annoying.
81146|1|It's a riveting yarn about seat-of-the-pants moviemaking, populated with eccentric characters -- not the least of whom is Melvin.
61942|1|Like the novel, Harriet the Spy is a rare children's story that celebrates the budding artistic spirit.
18993|0|This is Carl Reiner's cleverly adapted spoof on noir films of the post-World War 11 days.
58373|0|The extreme gore is gratuitous, and character development non-existent in a movie packed with the cookie-cutter visual design of the previous two films. Torturer, victim and audience become one.
17694|1|A passable low-budget horror flick with a winning performance by Jenny Wright (Near Dark).
5457|1|Boasting strong performances from Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis, this interracial drama of two escaped convicts is Stanley Kramer's most satisfying film, deservedly nominated for and winning Oscars.
9257|0|In his enthusiasm to both educate and entertain, Robbins has grossly overreached his abilities to formulate a digestible narrative, piling on stories, characters, issues and political debate such that the film begins to feel incomprehensibly and oppressiv

35548|1|A funny, touching, sumptuous, and incredibly romantic ode to the joys of love and food.
36959|0|Raising Helen can best be described as Jersey Girl with better acting. The idea isn't that interesting, but at least the people involved seem more committed.
16492|0|This movie doesn't have the wry kick of the TV show at its best. Too rich, too loaded, Maverick may have misplayed its cards, kept its eyes on the pot instead of the players. In movies, as in poker, you can't always trust a pat hand.
3937|1|Does any of this work? Sure, but only through the graces of a cast that knows better than to play to our hearts.

66509|1|For John Waters purists, this will be upheld as the real thing, but for most others, the licentious social commentary will only disgust or shock.
53057|1|Think of it as an extravagant and exhilarating, if over-the-top, piece of filmmaking that's silly, to be sure, but engrossing at the same time.
26793|0|This is a violence-ridden movie with one of the most despicable characters you ever will see.
67300|0|Hardly ever elevates its humor beyond the mindset of a 10 year old.
64561|0|However, by refilming the sketches for a cinematic format, with new editing, camerawork, close-ups ... yet without the give-and-take energy of a live studio audience, what on TV was seat-of-the-pants fresh is here flat and overproduced.

52816|1|In the fall of 1973, one could see signposts of cinema's future in Mean Streets and The Exorcist, yet with this youthful pair of proto-indie dreamers, Malick was paving a whole new road. It turned out to be the path most traveled.

12925|0|The Ring doesn't have the wiliness or conviction to exploit either a single mother's guilt over child neglect or our collective queasiness over potential bad seeds. It merely alternates these themes and toys with them.

38871|1|Branagh's dogged vision of Shakespeare resonates.
68413|1|I was not a fan of the first of these new Pink Panther films, but I must admit this time around Martin nails the puffed-up twittery of the character and performs the physical gags well.
2400|1|One wonders how much of their performances came from Dance's direction and how much came from the actresses themselves, but what counts is what is there on the screen, which is more than satisfactory.
3285|1|These are two great actors giving top-notch performances, and the restrained romance they project is fascinating.
48993|1|Murderball is no Rocky-esque hymn to the human spirit. It's more like a prison movie...
28543|1|We leave this movie hoping to see Miller and Lewis together again soon.
38642|1|Darfur Now does one thing other documentaries on the region in western Sudan haven't done so far: It offers hope that something substantive may be done about the Darfur genocide.
54635|1|The effects are astonishing. It's funny, it's dark, it's smart and it's filled with guns, lots of guns. A landmark film and quite possibly the ultimate expression of cyberpunk.
39556|0|Dreary suburban drama with a goopy horror finale, Society seems to be about a whole lot of ideas - when in truth it presents one or two pedestrian concepts and then repeats them ad nauseum.
16927|1|Lieutenant Josh Rushing emerges as a voice of reason, a moral arbiter between al-Jazeera and Fox News.
12396|1|What makes the movie fascinating is that it doesn't settle for a soap opera resolution to this story, with Pilar as the victim, Antonio as the villain, and evil vanquished. It digs deeper and more painfully.
43013|1|The film's deliberate color palette and tightly choreographed, perfectly timed sequences recall Jacques Tati. But there's an irreverent, off-center humor here that's distinctly their own.

18994|1|A gripping thriller with a terrific performance by Garfield. It seems only the good peformers and directors got blacklisted (in this case Garfield and Polonsky).
40356|1|It will confound some and inspire others to riff endlessly on its mysteries.
15022|1|There's nothing original about this film, but it does boast a solid anchor in Goldberg and include some pretty good acting around her.
27299|1|It is not the Broadway classic, but it's ok. Just for fun.

6787|1|Pleasantly entertaining and intelligent, it does not create enough of a spiritual mystery to move the heart, but watching the characters droolingly circle one another has its own, more earthly rewards.
18661|1|Doug Pray, has made a fascinating look at a man who not only was a great revolutionary, but a pure human being.

31114|0|The new version of George A Romero's 1979 zombie movie arrives with all the expected technical improvements but abandons the satire that made Romero's film a masterpiece of the genre.
19054|1|If you're tired of computer-generated visuals then you'll appreciate the domestic feel of the film's effects
16187|1|An appealing film that defies simple categorisation.
24457|1|This third outing in the Major League series... won't set any box office records [b]ut it's an amusing film in its own right...
6247|0|Despite a few effective scares, this new Grudge never really generates the right amount of tension.
68887|0|The movie is exhausting, utterly without feeling, and pointless -- though Smith looks great in his Western outfit.
80581|0|If genital mutilation, rape, incest and twisted acts of sexual gratification are your thing, then this is the film for you. Any takers?
62112|0|The strippers each fit into nice clearly delineated archetypes (a function of most strippers' personas, but one you don't expect to be as well defined in their real lives).
2974|1|Let us start from the dual positions that sex can (potentially) bring us closer to God and that cinema, in and of itself, is a holy medium given to the transcendent.
79140|1|Beautifully designed, visually stunning epic with impressive battle sequences, although the soap-tastic plot takes a while to really get going.
25840|0|There are a few lively bits, and one joke with an edge: a slap at Stephen Hawking and his computer-drone voice. Mostly, though, this is super-lame.
11631|1|Like all great works of art, the film has a purity of line and structure as it plays out its theme.
3044|1|Smith's politically incorrect references are never malicious or fueled by anger.
27063|1|as everyone knows, putting a self-serious egomaniacal movie star in a bad hairpiece is comedy gold.
72230|1|An uncommonly smart and insightful look at relationships while delivering the requisite laughs and romantic heat.
44353|0|The most cloying family meeting since A Very Brady Christmas
26462|0|There might have been a decent comedy here if someone had remembered to insert some actual humor.
74836|1|'The film, in its own remarkably observational way, gradually transforms from an often brutal comedy into a domestic horror film.'
50238|0|Apart from Jon Voight, slumming and turning in a rather droll, if lonely, performance as the German-accented villain, the movie amounts to cynical, cutesy claptrap.
49376|0|The expression of horror and amazement upon Bob Newhart's face captures, in one split second, the essence of the entire film.
44390|0|A magical film: it never runs out of new and delightful ways to be completely inane.
47044|1|One of the finest political satires you're ever likely to see.
72187|1|More fun, goofy cartoon antics than Disney polish.
68060|1|A tenacious survival tale in which passionate lovers are held apart by outmoded traditions. How they overcome obstacles to happiness is what makes the film so dramatically engaging.
5426|1|Some killing, but most violence is PG-13.
15015|1|The film leaves a good impression on the viewer as one that is ably directed, written, acted, and photographed.
34615|1|It's a movie you sit back and marvel at.
45375|0|Where is Jason Voorhess, the hockey-masked killer of Camp Crystal Lake, when you really need him?
23703|1|Neither a great movie nor even a classic noir but it has a great ambition to be daring and, once seen, is not easily forgotten.
13702|1|"""Holocaust comedy"" + ""life-affirming drama"" = molto hilarious dramadic cadffefmng. Perhaps cadffefmng should mean ""magical taste of realism."""
9313|1|Meryl Streep received yet another Oscar nomination for this conventional biopic of the Harlem music teacher, directed by no other than horror maestro wes Craven.
9115|1|Despite being bogged down by several distracting, extended dance numbers, this zany farce has just enough momentum and surprises along the way to hold one's interest for the duration. But it'll help immeasurably if you're a devotee of daytime soap operas.
71470|1|Dickerson's story of street kids at risk breaks no new ground. It is better than most, but not by much. Sure looks good, though.
74916|1|It's an impressive display of range from one of film's true maverick talents.
33328|1|Speed Channel enthusiasts will eat the stuff up, and the film is accessible enough for nonfans to taste the high of legal and illegal speed, dusted with the promise of glory
59715|0|The only thing more worn than the humour is a tired-looking Nielsen.
70112|0|Bobcat Goldthwait and a talking horse. Go nuts.
63930|1|Day-Lewis, so intricately repressed in The Age of Innocence, here offers a role reversal in an unreserved and emotional performance that throws caution and inhibition to the winds.
51613|0|It's not a smart movie.
734|1|A well-meaning attempt to channel the spirit of the 60s counterculture.
19858|0|There's no nice way to say this, so I'll just say it: Writer/directors Friedberg and Seltzer are a scourge. They're a plague on our cinematic landscape, a national shame, a danger to our culture.
47398|0|There is nothing really engaging about this latest effort from the creator of An American Tale and Hanna-Barbera.
18339|0|No Such Thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina.
57905|0|Unfortunately, Hiller doesn't command the intensity of feeling that might have made it emotionally valid, and he doesn't have the awareness of the cultural forces at work in his film that might have made it intellectually respectable.
81280|1|There's no denying the iron grip of the movie's message.
5018|1|Given his cornucopia of characters fighting wars on three fronts, his whiplash tonal switchbacks, his jazzlike aesthetic of chance, how is it that Arnaud Desplechin is only now coming home for the holidays?
54044|0|... I felt as if I were being preached to throughout this film.

46664|1|Just barely worth checking out, and even then, it's only for the actors.
3500|0|A completely unnecessary movie.
57268|1|Looks just like many other war films that salute the glories of war.
6825|1|Bobby throbs with tremendous contemporary relevance.
6640|1|Still pretty creepy murder mystery starring Dunaway and Tommy Lee.
4207|0|While the makers of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves may have set out to bury the poor old duffer of Sherwood Forest in a welter of trendy banter, they have ended up burying themselves as well.
26595|1|A map that leads as near to the Iraqi heart as we can find in American movies.
4795|0|Something less fun than the worst exploitation sci-fl flick thrown at us by the likes of Roger Corman.
17103|1|You may feel like you need a drink and a shower when you come out of Naked, but at least you'll know you've been somewhere new.
22332|0|Here is a nicely photographed, but bland, insipid and weirdly passive-aggressive little film.
11979|1|Shakespearean in its violence, Oldboy also calls up nightmare images of spiritual and physical isolation that are worthy of Samuel Beckett or Dostoyevsky.
49585|1|Daredevil is a perfectly serviceable B-movie, something to tide over genre fans waiting for X-Men 2.
12588|1|In this context, the presence of President Bush -- the Professor Moriarty of the new wave of liberal docs -- is as depressingly predictable as a baby left in a car in August.
12302|1|Hunger will leave you feeling emotionally battered and bruised -- yet emerging from the cinema a stronger person for having witnessed such a beautiful and brutal film.
10379|1|It does a good job of serving up elements that will please the fans of the show, but it does not quite stand on its own as a memorable motion picture event.
16781|1|Smoothly troweled and thoroughly entertaining.
13460|1|"""Mississippi Burning"" feels like a movie made from the inside out, a movie that knows the ways and people of its small Southern city so intimately that, having seen it, I know the place I'd go for a cup of coffee and the place I'd steer clear from."
15033|0|Just as you can't judge a '50s comic book by its lurid cover, so you can't judge a cheapo, three-part film by its sources.
14204|1|"""Control Room"" acknowledges wartime journalism sits between objectivity and propaganda, indifference and passion. Neutrality doesn't exist; to avoid gore is a stance. In a way, it's TV's true reality - the impossibility of objective footage of horror."
19104|0|I don't know if I'm getting more squeamish, or simply less charitable at being exploitatively manipulated and taken for a moron: possibly both. But I think others will share my disgust at several scenes in Bless The Child.
9571|0|There's charm in this simple underdog tale, but clunky plotting and characterisation mean it has 'telemovie' written all over it. You'd be better off renting Spellbound instead.
65911|0|As a study in the macabre, it barely suffices; as a sick and bloody joke, it's bloody sick.
72791|1|Bittersweet coming-of-age tale about sexuality, love, loss, and forgiveness.
57855|1|...sort of like A Civil Action Lite
73849|0|'The Bucket List' begins with a bleak, unsparing glimpse into the unraveling lives of two terminal-cancer patients and ends in unblushing sentimentality.

57288|1|anything but a cautionary expose. In fact, it's almost an urban fairy tale.
49292|1|It's such a tag-team of acting goodness that it's a shame it's not a better film.
73837|1|A sly, wry fable about the refusal to grow old that has poignancy as well as charm.
14071|1|More character piece than the expected tragedy or parody, W. is surprisingly good fun.
52449|1|The film's draughtsmanship is more than adequate, the voicing of the characters excellent, and the songs are way above average for such fare.
37104|1|most overlooked film . . . contains some of the Tramp's best comic moments
62701|1|It's an extremely difficult, often infuriatingly self-indulgent movie that really doesn't capture the essence of Kafka's novel. But it's also completely absorbing, almost gleefully Wellesian in every frame, and altogether an unforgettable experience.
46567|1|"There are whispers of bigger themes present -- the changing nature of friendship, the co-opting of '90s ""alternative"" culture into the mainstream -- but, for the most part, much of what you get out of the film depends what you bring to it."
13023|1|Allen has no affinity for Renoir's robust generosity, yet this study does wonders for his filmmaking
56821|0|Feast of Love is the kind of movie that gets conveniently omitted from r√©sum√©s.
49491|1|Steve McQueen is nevertheless very impressive in his role.
72953|1|Measures up to the promise Ballard amply provided in his first feature, The Black Stallion.
14630|1|A quirky May-December romancer that's subtle and low key in its sweetness. Garner and Field make for an unlikely romantic tandem
74722|0|Blast from the Past is a cute idea that delivers a few good scenes, but not enough to make the movie consistently entertaining.
64112|1|It doesn't match up to the same level as Donnie Brasco, but In Too Deep is still a decent update of the gangster genre.
4054|1|Friday movies are a lot like an African-American version of Seinfeld; they're really about nothing. And if you can appreciate the cultural dislocation of their urban California milieu, same as Seinfeld, they can be funny as hell.
35773|1|This oft-dismissed exception in the Marx Brothers canon includes no musical numbers and only a few bits specifically tailored to the brothers...underrated.
27753|1|It may be devoid of significance of any sort, but it is nevertheless passably entertaining, and certainly better viewing than most MacLean adaptations.
72646|1|Watching Frank work in his studio is a lesson in creativity. He seems to pride himself on buildings with no right angles; it all comes together to create facades that stand out in a skyline.
53730|0|Funny Martin Lawrence in drag with potty jokes.
61681|1|A film that manages to be intelligent without being boring, making it one of the better music documentaries in recent memory.
10231|1|If ultimately there is less to Sense than meets the eye, director-writer M. Night Shyamalan (Wide Awake) at least avoids gory cheap thrills in favor of muted chills. He bears watching.
12925|0|It's hard to imagine much of an audience for this film outside of the limited ranks of Dolls fans, or those who swoon over any whiff of celebrity ruin and retrieval, regardless of how conventional.
47113|1|Above average spy adventure w/young Jon Voight.
19736|1|A vast prose-poem on celluloid whose forms and ideas were to be borrowed by moviemakers like Lynch and Spielberg.
39178|1|Writer/director Peter Sollett refreshingly avoids placing characters into lazy traps of pregnancy, betrayal or violence. These are intelligent, thoughtful teenagers whom you'll fondly remember as struggling through desires and instincts.
44463|0|A creamy-colored yet derivative sci-fi fantasy with a few rip-offs so blatant ... that even kiddie fans not yet mentally agile enough to make sense of the loopy plot could pick them out.
65790|1|Hell's Angels (1930) is known for Howard Hughes' direction, and 18-year-old blonde bombshell Jean Harlow's first major role and big break into film
45260|1|It's a mind-blower.
6469|1|An astonishing directorial debut.
81296|1|Not the equal of Stanley Donen's parallel project, The Pajama Game, but a fine and vigorous film of the Broadway musical nonetheless.
36100|1|A fascinating murder mystery story that at the same time brings to our attention the plight of the modern Indians living on the reservation.
31579|0|More dialogue-heavy and somewhat less frenetic, this sequel is somewhat more to my own taste.
9482|1|"""Very, very scary and phenomenally influential."
25802|1|...a spare premise that's utilized to surprisingly positive effect...
69774|1|This is a very funny satire of television.
71107|0|Bridget is back, but the question is why?
37850|1|Peter O'Toole so completely throws himself into the role of Maurice... that the only response is to suspect that he is letting us see the real man behind the actorly mask...
44063|0|Banderas mopes through this hideous and unintelligible enterprise like a bloodhound with a hangover, while Liu elects to look cool in leather in lieu of a performance.
44343|0|A bland, seagoing, feature-length sitcom which recycles the displaced-dad theme from the studio's recent hit What About Bob? to little effect.
67570|0|YOU, ME AND DUPREE is another in a long line of mediocre films to be released in 2006.
16272|1|There's a heist, a jail break, and a flawless melding of comedy and drama and Steven Soderbergh ties it together like a master.
1565|1|The film's greatest achievement is to avoid the easy, patronizing laughs and instead see the near heroic qualities of a patently untalented artist.
75865|0|Some individual sequences -- including a car chase early in the film - have the lunatic humor that might have made the rest of the film bearable, though probably nothing would justify the film's final blood bath.
30524|0|The script is a jumble of caricatures and cliches.
16659|0|If you've ever wondered what it would feel like to be trapped in a '36 Ford convertible for 47 years with a Yiddish theater version of Dr. Phil and the runaway bride, this is the movie for you.
47217|1|It's the film's brevity that prevents it from soaring, since the stripped-down narrative generally allows only the widest of brush strokes when it comes to painting the characters and their situations. Cooper's performance is masterful, however.
63516|1|A silly movie that never for a minute tries to be anything else...it doesn't require anything from its audience but to laugh and enjoy the show.
37971|0|Those who should be offended are American veterans. Their service has been reduced to a sentimental fable of two heroic pilots and their noble lass proving their gumption and their bravery. Even as a tall tale, it's puny.
15268|0|A tepid and repetitious comedy.
68436|0|The script is so simplistic that it's almost funny as a spoof.
60645|0|No logic, little character development and a thin story that is supposed to be compensated for by startling effects.
19940|0|Remake of Robert Aldrich's revered 1965 classic would be 15% better if not for its abysmal use of pop music, and 100% better if Aldrich's son William had never thought to ride on his father's coattails by producing it in the first place.
77010|1|The Weitzes allow the humour to come more naturally out of the interactions between the characters, and they thankfully refuse to exploit these same serious moments for their sentimental value.
26544|1|Has an emotional resonance above what we've come to expect/dread from big name Hollywood movies.
65961|1|LaBute's observations about our self-destructive obsession with appearances may not be original, but his ability to create articulate, provocative characters is.
26192|0|It's too lean to deserve marquee billing.
8768|1|A sweet good-hearted romance, and the first real sign that both star and director were here to stay.
20177|1|Tierney's Ellen Berent [is] one of cinema's most chilling psychopaths.
17|0|Andrew Bergman's direction makes it watchable, but his screenplay pulls its punches on the sleaze, and tear-jerking sentimentality and inadequate humour don't combine well with the drama.
34660|1|The central thriller element of the film more than compensates for these deficiencies as well as any of the dodgier script moments.
54369|1|Spendid period piece about an endurance horse race.
64017|0|Not so venally stupid as its predecessor.
43871|0|The screenplay is hopelessly vulgar; the filmmaking is hopelessly clumsy.
65698|0|While Perfect Stranger had its moments and wisely made its characters less than perfect, it was a pedestrian yarn better suited for the small screen than the silver one.
8814|1|As much as it is a horror film and western, it is equally and perhaps more pronouncedly a romance.
14732|1|A picture-perfect example of how three great performers can elevate even the slightest and most lightweight material imaginable.
53523|1|The prison atmosphere of constant danger was fully captured, as the film had a gritty, realistic look.
15520|0|Mr. Depp demonstrates once again that he never disappoints as an actor, even in something as fraudulent as Secret Window.
34294|1|A slow-motion valse, a thesis on aestheticism, a raid on the fabrication of illusions
5137|0|About as much fun as being lost in a swamp.
56389|1|Avoids many of the tragic biopic pitfalls.
37393|1|A first rate thriller, First Snow is about a man haunted by his past who revisits it in a bid to change his destiny. It's a terrific role for Guy Pearce, who ably carries the film on his shoulders
45526|1|Really nifty coming-of-age story from the young Coppola.
24694|1|I'm not sure what it really is about, but it's one hell of a ride.
71794|1|Memorable, and responsible for inspiring a cottage industry of ragamuffin musicals a la Newsies.
64306|1|Not a masterpiece, mind you, nor the funniest thing you could see on a lazy summer afternoon; but a fine motion picture.
2219|1|If you are expecting anything new or profound to be added to the Rocky recipe then guess again - there is nothing fresh or original here, simply a wellconstructed and engagingly-performed film that will tick all the right boxes for Rocky fans.
70538|1|Truly intense and cinematically arresting.
8026|1|It's a ghost story; it's a meditation on time, memory and the poignancy of married love. And it's a masterpiece.
69505|1|There cannot be many people who wouldn't want to pay to see Deneuve smash a bottle over the head of an old woman in a wheelchair.
5475|1|Top-notch courtroom drama, with Bogie etching another unforgettable character.
32612|0|Director Kristen Coury has made a technically polished first film, but her sense of comic timing and sexual politics is strictly borscht belt.
37962|1|This minor Vegas-set drama, about a loser and his older mentor, shows the features that will mark Anderson's better films: love for his characters, taut dialogue at the expense of plot, and fascination with the possibilities of the film medium.
11775|1|"Leos Carax's inspiration for this film was Jean Vigo's masterpiece ""L'Atalante"" (1934)."
73803|0|Cokliss's direction strains for a stylishness it doesn't achieve, yet his fundamentally straightforward style brings out the abstract design of the plot.
43857|0|Just as two Truman Capote biopics came in subsequent Oscar seasons, so two period films about stage magicians appear with only winter to separate them. And, frankly, The Illusionist has missed a trick.
66451|1|The film draws upon news footage, old song recordings and interviews with his friends to craft a portrait in immense, rewarding detail.
67696|0|Every Scott movie has worthwhile visual dazzle, but this is what happens when Hollywood giants lecture against the evils of wealth.
423|1|It's gritty, real and totally engrossing.
29111|0|A stridently unfunny western comedy that is equally lame in its writing and direction.
23122|0|The setup of this computer-animated feature is strained, the story is contrived, and the ending is downright silly.
12108|1|An unexpectedly satisfying, imaginative movie during a season of silliness and spectacle.
26514|1|If you like underdog movies, you might like this one. Especially if you haven't seen very many.
13050|0|Unwatchable drivel.
65402|1|It is the work of masters perfecting their craft, setting off together towards a horizon of shining prowess to discover, quite literally, the pinnacle of their cinematic potential.
1790|0|Some of us, however, are at least as interested in software as hardware, which often makes Stealth tedious going.
77192|0|At first, a great deal happens, then nothing much happens for quite some time, then something so underwhelming happens that one is left wondering, 'Did that really just happen?'
67181|0|It's hard to imagine the pair actually fell in love to the strains of 70s songwriting icon Donovan.
16319|1|Done with such a wry sense of humor - thanks, especially, to an over-the-top, hopefully intentional, outrageous performance by Jon Voight, and some nifty snake effects - that you forgive its derivative nature and settle down for some fun.
5982|1|An English mother-daughter racial melodrama that resonates with simplicity and insight. Leigh is considerate of his movie's identity and spirit just as much as demonstrates this with his wounded protagonists
683|1|"An infectious albeit formulaic game of Cinderella football, this happy athletic romp seems to know just how wheezy it is, but the team grunts ""hut, hut,"" and puts it right on the numbers anyway."
13813|1|Mrs Miniver as a whole certainly is very silly sometimes... and yet, and yet. Sometimes through its sheer unselfconscious earnestness, it packs a punch.
5390|1|Director John Sturges was extremely fortunate in securing a near-perfect cast for this enduringly popular western reworking of Japanese classic Seven Samurai.
8810|1|... Not only the best action movie ever made but one of the very best of any genre.
57448|1|The tale is told in contemplative wide-angle shots; the absence of any spurious, unearned intimacy with the characters makes the climactic scenes profoundly moving.
59843|1|"The film's dominant motif is that of revenge. In a key scene, the wife tells her husband (Harrison Ford): You get him. I don't care what you have to do, just get him."" From that point on, the film becomes the story of a nuclear family in imminent danger."
27825|1|What makes it all work is how honest and grounded Spurlock is.
5207|0|...Hampered as much by the film's third-rate script as Meadows's own weakness as an actor.
71094|1|Early Hitchcock soundie still stylish, still grabs
61741|1|As embodied by Liam Neeson, Rob Roy is a tremendous protagonist -- a naive man whose belief in honor and whose love for a woman, family, and clan make him a figure to cheer for.
5667|1|An amusingly caustic, straight-up serving of film noir staples spiced with star charisma.
68936|1|It's absolutely riveting.
10472|0|"For audiences who adored ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding,"" Nia Vardalos' follow up movie (she wrote both scripts) will come as a big fat letdown."
42806|0|The three unwieldy story lines might even have daunted someone like David Lean. They utterly defeat director John Dahl, a director used to working in miniature
31670|1|Wesley Snipes is in top form. A top-notch action thriller.
1289|1|As the center of the drama, Mr. Washington more than fills the screen; he very nearly sets it on fire.
4987|1|Splash is probably the ultimate fish-out-of-water film, primarily because it literally features a fish out of water.
58125|1|Though the film is wrenching like few others, this is only because it is also a masterpiece.
30723|1|a damn good suspense movie, against all reasonable expectations. Best of all, however, is the return of Anthony Hopkins as evil incarnate himself, Doctor Hannibal Lecter
2303|1|James Bond for kids, Spy Kids 2 is an energetic, inventive and zappy adventure filled with colour, gadgets and larger than life characters. It's a blast of a movie.
69494|0|It's good for a half-hour of humor before the fun starts to dissolve.
34849|1|This look at the Rolling Stones' disastrous concert at Altamont is so chilling it will prevent anyone from ever looking back at the 1960s with rose-colored glasses.
72374|0|A step above the standard slasher flick and comes with some unusual ideas (along with some silly ones).
53456|1|...a Hollywood romantic comedy stripped of all the bombast and star turns.
67362|1|The performances are great.
48990|0|Stanley's attempts at visual stylishness are so relentless they preclude the simple act of telling a good tale.
59249|1|An original idea but too dark--not the story, but the set.
18058|0|Man Trouble is abysmally amateurish from start to finish, never making any kind of sense on any level at any time during its running time.
48938|0|As Vampire's Kiss unspools, the lead character, Peter Loew (Cage), wavers in and out of this accent and a wide variety of voices, seeming to give every role Cage has ever played (or would ever play, past, present and future) equal vocal time in the film.
4529|1|Kon provides a gritty depiction of Tokyo street life, but balances it with a dose of fantasy (it is Christmas, after all) and comically exaggerated characters.
57462|0|Blame Will Farrell and the director who let him run amok for the failure of this film.

29903|1|Could have used some 'star power,' but overall should make Webber followers happy
35412|1|The heart of the film belongs to White and Weitz, both of whom turn in surprisingly good performances, considering they usually work behind the camera.
45835|0|Intensely colourful, but somehow soulless.
7964|0|For a movie that's ostensibly about intelligence, Phenomenon proves to be rather simple-minded.
6690|1|For all Lee's meticulous control over this immaculately nuanced melodrama-thriller, there is a surprising lack of emotional draw.
14649|1|An emorionally intense small-town melodrama, in which all the women are love or sex-starved, but is extremely well acted by William Holden, Rosalind Russell, and Kim Novak
20403|1|A competent bit of work from which striking originality and idiosyncrasy have mostly been pruned away.
63921|1|His performance is a vivid reminder that Sharif, 71, is still out there and capable of doing fine work when it is offered to him.
8073|0|...ugly, unedifying exploitation cinema.
28232|1|Returning to the horror-comic vein that launched their careers, director Joel Coen and producer Ethan Coen pepper their new picture with so much humor that the occasional bursts of sheer mayhem seem more ridiculous than revolting.
19592|1|This is the kind of film we would all like to make, if we were very old and very serene. There were times when I felt uncannily as if Kurosawa were filming his own graceful decline into the night.

829|0|I would imagine that if you have a close connection to Ellis Island immigrants, you will be similarly touched by this movie.
31909|1|The Rocker is certainly not This Is Spinal Tap, but it is fair to moderate entertainment and Rainn Wilson holds it all together energetically.
76142|0|Pacino looks half asleep throughout, no doubt concentrating solely on his cheque, while the script is a catalogue of clich√©s and contrivances.
7962|1|Rare is the terrible film that's this upbeat and delightful and entertaining.
75845|1|Disappointing to say the least, but at least it doesn't have Richard Pryor this time as its star.
49067|0|The film holds the interest, to be sure, but more due to the sure sense of craft and precise effect that one expects from the Coens than from genuine involvement in the story.

75853|1|The evocative imagery and gentle, lapping rhythms of this film are infectious -- it gets under our skin and draws us in long before the plot kicks into gear.
15414|0|A noble effort but misguided and largely bloodless.
9449|0|The city that Federico Fellini explores for almost two hours bears little resemblance to the real Rome.
34869|1|What Mr. Pollack's movies lack in momentum, they make up for in quiet gravity.
14801|0|Borrowing liberally from both The Parent Trap' and The Great Escape, this misguided attempt at family farce rests on a couple of incompatible premises -- romantic matchmaking and imprisoned dispair.
79151|1|Like its title character, Duma has been left to fend for itself by Warner Bros., which is barely releasing it. A successful showing this weekend will prove that there really is an audience for this brand of thoughtful, literate family film.
70955|1|A film rich with unforgettable imagery, killer lines and physical thrills.
76188|1|Martin Scorsese's soberest, most vivaciously thrilling vision of how hollow (and short) the fast lives of mafios really are.
79910|1|...the daisy-chain of prop gags, slide-whistle humor, and blackout sketches merge sometimes uneasily with the romantic and mystery-thriller components. What glues it together, barely, is the talented cast in fine form....
7996|0|Their acceptance of the tango and foxtrot never seems like much of a dance dance revolution; if you're looking for more than just impressive dancing, well, you got served.
81256|1|"Merely one of the greatest Westerns ever made, John Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a genuine masterpiece, notable for (among other attributes) the immortal line, ""When the legend becomes fact, print the legend."""
3993|1|The movie is wonderfully cast -- it has the strongest bench of any movie this year, with Albert Brooks and Don Cheadle in key supporting roles.
13903|1|As played winningly by Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, there is a quirky chemistry created in their offbeat pairing.
11666|1|... heavy on the technical details.
14158|1|When his face turns green and his limbs get limber, Carrey's pretty much unstoppable. This cartoon-y creation is an amazing fusion of physical comedy and state-of-the- art cinema illusion.
16497|1|A fun, clever horror picture, full of creepy crawlies, things that go bump in the night, and references to everyone from H.P. Lovecraft to Dario Argento.
75025|1|A lyrical throwback to such movies as Ren√© Cl√©ment's Forbidden Games (1952) and other works of the humanist European cinema of a half century ago.

3758|1|(Wells) never imagined our 21st century gadgets would be so tiny; pocket-sized streaming devices for a population more interested in gazing at navels than at stars.
32353|1|It might not be a film that can be taken too literally, that doesn't mean it shouldn't be taken seriously.
12794|0|Achieves the dubious distinction of featuring a large gallery of nearly all unlikable characters.
36863|0|Sixty Six may find a niche audience, but instead of depicting a boy's first steps toward manhood -- ceremony aside -- it turns into an uninvolving portrait of self-absorption.
60525|1|It is a sparkling film, an American Borsalino, with sharp, clever dialogue, directed at a fine pace and with a good eye for period detail by George Roy Hill.
37369|0|There was a time when movies like DOA: Dead or Alive lurked sheepishly at schoolboy height on video store shelves, spines straining to accommodate the charms of their actresses.
16823|0|despite dead horses, crazed hicks and plagues of snakes, the only truly horrifying moment here is the hint at the end that there may be a sequel.
3371|1|Easily the best movie of the year, so far. Really.
19879|0|The level of beefcakery reaches hilarious proportions...
17086|0|It tilts so far in one direction that the comic elements seem to come from another, lesser film.
52894|1|...comes off as an honest and believable piece of work...
11799|1|The most famous and perhaps most effective propaganda film of World War II.
32407|1|Still the gold standard of food movies.
1242|0|Leering and tacky, yet annoyingly chaste at the same time. Should have remained the TV-movie it was meant to be.
22967|0|"Whitewashing the truth is a forgivable sin in the world of biopics, but to demean ideologies by remaining ""balanced"" is cowardly."
8510|1|But the success of this documentary may ultimately qualify as faint praise since what it really confirms is that rock 'n' roll's greatest glories happened 40 years ago...
62813|1|A comic exploration of the changing face of the mafia, the only damage this mob will do is to your funnybone.
8876|1|An inventive and terrifying horror film that explores the inner psyche and its ability to turn nightmares into reality.
65349|0|Damaged individuals healing one another is a serviceable idea for a film, but Things We Lost in the Fire is missing an essential component: plausibility.
16412|0|Even viewers able to get past the disturbing setup of the film's critical plot element will find an uneven mess of under-realized ideas and overdone grotesqueries.
16090|1|I dont have to run away from anything cause I dont believe in anything!
34549|0|Like an evil, terrifying version of The Odd Couple.
16200|0|David Mamet sets him on the path to righteousness in a collection of contrivances masquerading as a meaningful plot.
19822|1|The script is full of witty dialogue and simple yet complex situations.
4210|0|A poorly written and barely acted, but crowd-pleasing revenge flick.
18180|0|Carroll's milieu is resolutely middle class and the crises encountered all too predictable.
5043|1|This isn't your standard costume drama fare.
24625|1|L'Avventura eschews conventional narrative drive or sophomoric emotional satisfaction in favour of gorgeous compositions, inimitable style and an acerbic sensibility.
6220|1|It's very much what I think Anderson intended - a light travelogue of small consequence, with a slight, though sincere and concerned effort to bring a heart back into his films.
11740|1|Wilson plays disillusionment convincingly, the supporting cast (especially Barraza) is golden, and director Mark Pellington has just the right touch to bring off a teary-eyed inspirational drama.
8871|1|Tenebre is a brilliant piece of self-reflexive cinema.
16445|0|It's rote baloney, trotting out every dead-stupid cop-movie cliche in the book and doing it colorlessly.
37528|0|This film will...be quickly forgotten by anyone unfortunate enough to sit through it.
26049|1|Similar to The Seventh Continent, this film's objective is to analyze and deconstruct the effects rather than senselessly guess their causes
57655|1|This slapstick comedy -- with Steve Martin playing the fussy straight man -- should never have worked, but it does, and well enough to earn a place as a holiday classic.
56861|0|Like the world of his film, Hartley created a monster but didn't know how to handle it.
986|0|Those who know that human beings are more than just the sum of their worst impulses ... will wonder where the rest of the story went.
28996|1|A shining example of just how compelling and affecting low-budget filmmaking can be when you've got a good story and strong cast.
60784|1|Good Bye, Lenin! slides a fascinating history lesson into a clever, heartwarming tragicomedy even if the film - like East Germany itself - is a bit inefficient.
74224|0|More ugly and depressing than haunting or suspenseful.
7768|1|The filmmakers reveal a keen eye for oddities in the American landscape be it a pair of conjoined twins trying to look normal, a huge ark sitting in the middle of a Montana town or a rocket nestled in a barn.
80645|1|"You have to admire Jean-Pierre Melville's ambition to make a sophisticated ""b-movie"" that is moody, intelligent and consistently engaging."
49189|1|Holy Smoke juggles elements of comedy and psycho-sexual drama in its very intense story.
82065|1|A film that isn't as funny as it should be, but should have been seen by more people.
43796|1|One of Demme's most engaging films.
16373|1|In an unusual season with so many films are aimed at adults Things We Lost may be the most mature of the lot.
7628|1|Probably Fields' best film.
1681|1|Hitchcock's first talkie is still enjoyable if creaky.
60735|0|An interesting production but not a good movie.
74456|1|The movie begins slowly, methodically, and builds increasingly toward a devastating climax.
20915|1|Difficult to watch but hard to look away from.
75184|1|Soderbergh's most commercial film to date is a star-driven, semi-successful, slightly better remake of the 1960 origianl feature.
1488|1|Reasonably competent and breathlessly paced.
56174|1|If its backdrop and story never quite coalesce into a satisfying whole, then the film is saved by its sheer imaginative verve and by the terrific chase and battle sequences.
1354|0|The triad of performances by Toby Jones, Sandra Bullock and Daniel Craig keep it on its feet, but after a certain point it's stumbling aimlessly.
46328|1|There is a great movie inside, burning to break free of the shackles of the writers
1224|1|The look of the film is sometimes dreamy, sometimes crisp, but always engrossing.
72907|1|In one of his best performances, Cushing plays on the ambiguity of the central character, so that the Baron becomes a kind of Wildean martyr, alternating between noble defiance and detached cruelty.
13101|0|This is not the worst film of the year. In fact, it's not even really a bad movie. It's unoriginal, standard, and ordinary, but not terrible.
49354|1|Much more about the hows (and maybe the whys) than it is about the whats.
39450|1|"As a baby boomer myself, ""Arctic Tale"" falls just short of the Disney gems. But the aquatic adventures of the walruses alone get my seal of approval."
44937|1|A film that celebrates the importance of inspiration, albeit in slightly affected fashion.
20666|0|No amount of spastic-colon jokes, cartoon violence or good-buddy cameos (Al Sharpton, John McEnroe) can distract from the fact that Gary Cooper [Sandler] ain't.
13484|1|If anybody still thinks Kate Hudson is getting too much mileage out of being Goldie Hawn's daughter, they'll be pleasantly surprised by the range she shows in About Adam.
27480|0|Scripter Preston A. Whitmore II and helmer Kevin Hooks are obviously well-versed in film lore, for they have concocted a hodgepodge that recycles elements from several white-black team movies.
76115|0|Hugo Pool features an impressive collection of talent, including two of the best actors of their generation -- Sean Penn and Robert Downey Jr. Sadly, their talents are wasted in this muddled mix of romance and attempted satire.
41360|0|A waste of time and money.
6928|0|Crafting his meditation on the men who answer the call of the wild, Sean Penn's adaptation is heavy on mood and ambiance but sadly lacking in depth, giving up on the wider comparisons to focus fully on McCandless, who may not be up to the scrutiny.
4543|0|The movie is as well-intentioned as a Christmas card, but as a work of narrative art, it's a train wreck.
13905|1|Patience and curiosity help to reveal its heartfelt, hypnotic and richly poetic musings as serving as both a cry for help and an act of hope.
53705|1|A mighty accomplishment, and possibly the bravest Britflick yet made.
16301|1|Visually appealing.
15937|1|Tom Hanks kneeling before the moon is one of the most moving moments in cinema. This is one of my favorite films.
57903|1|Broomfield is energized by Volletta Wallace's maternal fury, her fearlessness, and because of that, his film crackles.
8689|1|It's edgy, fast-paced, and if you don't take it too seriously, a lot of fun.
43386|1|Napoleon Dynamite isn't exactly the year's funniest film, but it does make for a memorable experience that can be enjoyed over and over again.
22314|0|It is a tolerable film, but it is not enlightening and it sure isn't entertaining. It is underwritten ... a waste of a lot of good acting and directing talent.
22119|1|A key transitional work for the cinematic subversive, a seriously damning portrait of maternal martyrdom and, in a killer final shot, upward mobility.
49382|0|The premise of the story is good, but the execution of that story leaves a lot to be desired.
17050|0|Artfully staged and enthusiastically performed but unavoidably pretentious.
19044|1|You haven't lived until you've heard a Japanese actor use the phrase 'Whistling Dixie' in a sentence
6333|0|An attempt to make a different movie. And yes, it's different indeed but different is far from the same thing as good
19102|1|There's really no reason this kind of conventional David-and-Goliath tale (based on a true story) should make for such a compelling motion picture, but Soderbergh and Grant smartly mix plenty of humor and unflagging inspiration into the drama.
7236|1|Mr. Cooper may be a little loose-tooth in spots, but he gives a homespun performance such as only he can give. Miss Stanwyck is plenty yum-yum (meaning scorchy) in her worldly temptress role.
10188|1|[Michael Crichton] makes a creditable debut as a film director.
76162|1|Clive Owen's breakthrough role
9131|1|Fine if lower keyed Hitchcock with Fonda as wrongly accused man whose life is wrecked.
4494|0|The animation strives for 1950s sci-fi retro, but the result is that everyone looks like a plastic anim√© doll.
56048|1|A fascist film, or a film about a fascist cop? Either way, this is suspenseful, energetic stuff.
61743|1|Reopens our eyes to the cruelties and soul assassinations that were carried out daily in the name of state socialism.
31349|1|The screenplay is as tight as a right hook from Cassius Clay (who, incidentally, appears here as himself two years before becoming Muhammad Ali) and drives effortlessly toward its somber, heartbreaking conclusion.
54677|1|The days when Stephen was cute, it's pretty hip!
50635|1|Documentary best for teens interested in business.
32746|0|The more you understand what's really going on, the less you like it.
45172|0|"All in all, ""Collateral Damage"" is entertaining in all the ways a Schwarzenegger film is expected to: bad guys do him dirty, Arnold's character vows revenge, lots of things blow up, and the bad guys get theirs... a more intense actor would have carried it"
50920|1|This World War II romantic drama has the epic feel of classic cinema.
63816|1|For the most part, the scary parts are the scary parts, the funny parts are the funny parts, and never the twain meet.

50173|1|Set on a desert landscape a while after a nuclear holocaust, the film is about a young man, played by Don Johnson, who has a telepathic bond with a dog, the latter basically being the smarter of the two. He helps the dog find food and the dog helps him sn
80732|1|Gladiator is a triumph. On the surface, it's a terrific yarn with strong, rounded characters, agonizing suspense and visceral thrills. Look closer and you'll find rich historical themes, and a harrowing critique of violence as amusement.
59545|1|Tupac Shakur turned in an excellent final performance.
41062|1|A fine, sincere, outspoken film.
20202|0|Dull and way too long, Torn Curtain is only memorable for one very shocking and brutal scene.
72436|1|Sidney Lumet's handling of the material doesn't miss a beat; the only real trace of an encroaching staginess can be found in some of Dysart's lengthy monologues.
8964|0|If even half the scenes with the girls singing along to pop songs in the car were cut, Crossroads would barely qualify as feature length.
78864|1|Good character study of simple people
23656|1|Some witty humor and amusing characters, but suffocates from the weight of its own pretentiousness.
4979|0|This sequel to the Craven cheese fest is bad beyond the English language with Heather Locklear the poor man's Ann Darrow.
15768|1|Watching this spiritual odyssey is almost a religious experience in itself, but one which has nothing to do with faith or dogma, everything to do with Bresson's unique ability to exteriorise an interior world.
21743|0|The movie's a shipload of coming-of-age blather, supplemented with enough rolling-sea footage to make the audience yearn for both Dramamine and a decent drowning scene.
1075|1|[Features] lovely performance from Hepburn at its centre.
8045|0|Sloppy filmmaking as a whole.
10709|1|Hair-raising gangster movie in the style of John Woo.
19573|1|1989's middle entry, in which the pair head forward to 2015, is the most underrated -- like fellow second child Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, it had to contend with doltish charges of being too cold.
8592|1|Although the film contains many of the great verbal jokes that are Allen's forte, the visual wit and the sentimental drama fall a bit short.
31741|1|Kubrick worked in an uncharacteristically naturalistic style despite the genre material, with mixed but still fascinating results.
71929|0|The film collapses under the weight of stereotypes and a hackneyed concept.
64903|1|It might at least make you stop and think the next time you hear something on the news that's presented as gospel.
10518|0|I like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material, but they're treading water at best in this forgettable effort.
739|1|On film, with Taylor as the woman who saw something nasty and Clift as the psychiatrist trying to probe her trauma, the one-act material is stretched perilously thin; but it works for Hepburn as the incarnation of civilised depravity.
14874|0|Fuzzily conceived and blandly executed.
43008|1|The film has a lot of nice little touches going for it, and while there are the obligatory moments of heartstring plucking underscored by the stir of violins, it never really overdoes things. The only problem is, it's just been so done already.
10959|0|With her meager acting skills, overwrought mugging, shrill line delivery and quasi-Brit accent, Madonna makes Amber far more monstrous and comical than was obviously intended.
17871|1|Gridlock'd is refreshing because it's different. The subject matter isn't new, but the approach and tone are.

76390|1|[Best character was] Indian manservant who almost never spoke ... Powerful eyes.

44912|0|As hokey and banal as a sitcom, with predictable culture-clash gags and fairly flat one-liners.
38229|1|It's overwrought and lurid; the story is grotesque and so are the characters. It's unlike anything else before and since. And that is why this strident psychological horror stands up now as one of the great pieces of American genre cinema.
52310|0|A lightweight Jennifer Aniston vehicle that's been rumored to pass for a feature film.
42859|0|Just when you think American film comedy has hit the bottom of the barrel, it makes a supreme effort and keeps sinking.

58116|0|At the risk of sounding repetitive, I feel angry that I have wasted a perfectly good Friday night watching something this completely worthless.
13205|0|What's left is the framework for a graphic, brutal, sickening film, without the violent effects that might have made sense (however illegitimate) out of the conception.

40676|1|Filmmakers pull off a provocative, pulsating update on gangster pics with this action-laden epic about the rise and fall of an inner city crack dealer.
32832|1|The most serious problem with this film is its softness, that sentimentality Zeffirelli is often accused of.
80062|1|The middle of the film, though, finds Gibson at his sadistic best, depicting monumental savagery with a surreal cinematic glee that puts the Apocalypse in Apocalypto.
75482|1|The despair-and the artistry-is breathtaking.
39806|0|Like many villains before him, John turns out to have been wronged rather randomly, an act of terrible violence that he absorbs into his worldview.
3293|0|It's horribly dated, playing today like some weird, contrived burlesque of common sense.
59331|0|Despite being well acted and sweetly moving when it strips down to the tender poem at its heart, Till Human Voices Wake Us spends too much time playing to an otherworldly suspense that simply isn't there.

78873|0|Trying with all its might to be endearing, the magic is simply missing. Hoffman is unbelievably annoying as the lisping Willy Wonka wannabe, while Portman looks uninterested.
62331|1|Like many of the best English comedies, much of the humor here is based on character, good-natured high spirits, and fairly uninhibited vulgarity.
5536|0|It's not bad, but the original is better.
15177|1|As always, director Stephen Frears does a superb job of work when given a good script, and this is a very good script.

40850|1|A crisp, beautifully paced film, full of Siegel's wonderful coups of cutting and framing.

48656|1|The story is eerie and gets under the skin, but director Mark Pellington is unable to recreate the suspense found in the best supernatural thrillers.
45425|1|It's weird and surreal, but it ends with most of the holes plugged and all but a few of the loose ends tied into a tidy package. Some argue this is a cheat and the film should have been more open ended. That's a personal choice; I like it the way it is.

19123|0|Ultimately, though, In Praise of Love is about themes, about the anti-Hollywood sentiment that Godard feels so passionately about, and this is where the film begins to crumble.

80149|1|The world Coffy inhabits is revealed as one where social, sexual and political exploitation are simply the norms.
14163|0|A coarse muddle of melodrama, romance and cautionary tale, the film is chiefly a tribute to throbbing Latin manhood, as cretinous and sophomoric as it is pretentiously surreal.
2386|0|Proof positive that life's mundanities are even more tedious projected onto a movie screen.
9216|0|Directed by Kenneth Branagh and scripted by no less than Harold Pinter, the wicked charm of Sleuth Mk1 has been stripped away to leave a nasty, dispiriting and strangely cold psychological thriller.
59678|1|A very violent drama that takes a visceral stand against vengeance and ethnic cleansing.
63706|0|Aims to recapture the original's seamless pastiche (it's an imitation of an imitation) and fails. But it has an easily digestible, junky sense of humor about it.
57183|1|Awesome sequel! The gremlins have more clever bits and satirize themselves in this brilliant postmodern horror-comedy.

15234|1|The actors and the filmmakers all take a more restrained approach than you might expect, keeping the humor gentle, and the jokes mostly as literary as the premise.
49609|1|Closer, a lacerating four-character suite on the elusiveness of love and intimacy, finds Nichols returning to his roots without having lost his sardonic edge.
15047|0|I thought the original Halloween was overrated, the 2 or three cheapie sequels I've seen were even worse, and this new entry is still crap.
42673|1|Performances are made crystalline through a sixth sense for camera placement and curt cutting from director John Flynn, whose 2007 passing was little noted, though his no-BS way of laying down a story is a rare commodity in any era.
57123|0|A decent, but flawed movie. The performance by Nicholson is tremendous, and he really becomes Hoffa, but the rest of the film just isn't on the same level as he is. Unless you're a big fan of Jack, or particularly interested by Hoffa, pass.

20506|1|... one of the most rousing adventures of the 1970s.
53772|1|A cute movie that -- with a G rating -- is suitable for even the smallest children.
44430|0|It's a movie constructed around three or four self-consciously 'cool' episodes, and passably entertaining as such, but there's also an awful lot of uncool contrivance, coincidence and contempt for the audience.

16852|1|Sometimes stiff but fascinating biopic
5783|1|There's some nice ideas and realistically felt characters here.
65612|0|High Spirits most clearly resembles a disturbingly hollow combination of Ghostbusters, Police Academy, and every loud noise you've ever heard.
19554|0|It is fabulously badly made, with rare weak performances from otherwise excellent actors ... and idiotic dialogue and events.
21497|1|It's a great feeling, isn't it, falling in love with a movie about falling in love?
8748|1|With Jason and Freddy at war over the souls of children, this great send-up of the genre is extremely fun and is faithful to the characterizations long-established for these villains.
48258|0|Semi-Pro offers nothing new.
9489|1|Lovingly crafted.

11463|1|Sheridan Le Fanu's classic 1872 novella Carmilla has served as the basis for numerous vampire flicks, although it's probably safe to state that this blood-and-boob-filled adaptation from Hammer Films boasts the largest fan base.
22096|0|As From Hell sprints toward its climax, the tone grows more grim, the violence more explicit and the conspiracies more shrill.
4697|1|You have to like a movie that, in its rosy denouement, proclaims giddily, 'It's a great day for Flemish showbiz!'
41597|1|Will certainly resonate with its targeted preteen demographic, as its principal cast has returned for a sequel appropriately enhanced for the big screen.
12426|0|"A ""perfect"" flick for the Reagan era: a simplistic, distorted comicstrip actioner that nonetheless must have tapped into the collective nightmare that some American soldiers were still held prisoners or were missing in action in Vietnam."
26170|1|Sam Raimi's Army of Darkness delivers a great conclusion to what is one of the most unique trilogies in cinema history, providing a ton of laughs and plenty of exciting action in the process.
18908|1|The film possesses a view of the human condition nearly as stark and clear-eyed as its stunning cinematography, which paints Istanbul's domes and minarets and rural Anatolia's breathtaking landscapes with a cold, haunting beauty.

8678|1|A very funny, underrated comic romp from the early '80s.
31575|0|It has some decent eye candy, but overall this film is bluffing if they think it's a great, intelligent blackjack film. I know I just used a poker term, but I doubt 21 would have noticed.

52364|1|It feels like an homage to everything, as its likable heroines slowly wander through a movie wasteland filled with familiar landmarks
13363|1|No other film released so far this year is likely to generate as much discussion afterward.
47986|1|Doesn't have a nuance in it, but it's pretty consistently amusing in its latter-day Woody Allen way. For most of the way, its morals are happily, believably wrong, but all bad things must come to an end.
47117|1|It didn't move me as much as I think it should have.

3479|0|It's fairly exciting action cinema... [that] falls apart on the generally anemic, one-note characterisations and the lack of any particularly memorable performance.
7357|0|Could have been worse I suppose. At least there are no Pokemons or (shudder) grinning purple dinosaurs around.
34568|0|Here the love scenes all end in someone screaming. Maybe there's a metaphor here, but figuring it out wouldn't make Trouble Every Day any better.
77|0|A stronger actress, say Michelle Pfeiffer or Cate Blanchette, would have given this political melodrama more credibility and power, but Andie MacDowell is poorly cast and she seems lost.
48315|0|Well-acted but pedestrian TV-like melodrama what what consitutes a family, or sociology versus biology in the kinship debate.
32214|1|...worth catching both for its inherent qualities and as a snapshot of Hollywood in transition.
21676|1|...if the director, the producer, and the writer approved of the added scenes, I'm not going to complain. One way or the other, Amadeus remains a great film.
17804|1|There's a boldness to Branagh's Henry V, which shows off the cinematic possibilities of Shakespeare without a lot of distracting razzle-dazzle.

24622|0|The type of incoherent, indulgent muddle that can only emerge from the mind of someone who is quite talented.
26251|1|An affectionate tribute to the low-budget crime movies that Truffaut so loved, and it's one of my favorite Truffaut films.
60806|0|It's a workmanlike production, with no surprises, no scares and no jokes - unless you count the demon that laments his job by saying he must gather enough souls to fill a quota.
67489|1|Instead of simply stating that the racism is bad, Singleton tries to explain it through characters, which are multidimensional and believable, regardless of their race.
54197|0|[Brown Bunny] sports the narrative complexity of War and Peace compared with Twentynine Palms.

21301|0|The first movie I have seen that does not improve on the sight of a blank screen viewed for the same length of time.
16901|1|With Eastwood as Kincaid and Meryl Streep as Francesca, this carefully observant love story turns Waller's pop-lit passion into screen art.
15290|1|If the message seems more facile than the earlier films, the images have such a terrible beauty you may not care.

26615|1|This uncompromising drama makes a bleak statement of war fighting in trenches, stressing the inanity of WWI (or any war) for both sides; perhaps the most memorable moment is the one in which Lew Ayres reaches out for a butterfly to disastrous effect.
73730|1|A film like Diary of a Country Priest gathers its strength as it continues. There's always the sense that Bresson knows exactly where he's going and the simplest way to get there.
5449|0|A bleak, rather obvious melodrama disguised by a tricksy, time-splicing structure.
12101|0|The approach has all the lasting charm of a train derailment, but at least the train is going somewhere before it is brought to disaster.

18327|1|The chemistry between Washington and Fanning is the main reason why the story works. Without it, Man on Fire would just be a big dumb loud violent music video.
43588|1|It's a breath of fresh air to review a film that, having received an award from the Sundance Film Festival, actually deserves the accolade.
23711|1|Bowles's gentle, avian features, the obvious wisdom of his years and his distinctive presence are practically worth the price of admission.
23631|0|Can a philosophical monster movie work when it's not meant to be scary? Apparently indie bad boy Hal Hartley thinks so.

50273|0|Mildly irritating cowboy tale about modern-day rodeo riders in Manhattan.
9998|1|It's a lovely, rootin' tootin' cowboy romp with a superbly suspenseful runaway train finale, and an apt closer that permits the excitement to continue on beyond the screen. It was an utter joy in 1990, and again in 2010.
52585|1|Adaptation could very well be one of the best films of the year -- it truly is a roller coaster ride of pioneering pandemonium, and shouldn't be missed.

65240|1|Green's signature pastoral tangents and codeine pacing don't slow down this tale of two boys fleeing their psychotic uncle so much as inappropriately slacken any of the story's suspenseful aspects.
8506|1|If you're a novice, this is a plucky introduction to Whedon's world and the most fun sci-fi of the year. If you're a devotee, this is the magnificent return you've been praying for.
16018|1|A loopy movie that got its messages right.
18705|1|Carol Reed has made his film with deliberation and care, and has achieved splendid teamwork from every member of the cast. Occasionally too intent on pointing his moral and adorning his tale, he has missed little in its telling.
8066|1|Sequel talk often sparks because this unconventionally contemplative comic-book film is M. Night Shyamalan's only idea worth continuing -a patient, downbeat and thrillingly unpredictable drama that still stands today as Shyamalan's visionary masterpiece.
47923|0|An amalgamation of dozens of old television sitcoms.
79097|0|Director Greg Beeman can't disguise the lamentable script which, despite the best efforts of a likeable and willing cast, falls flat.
14490|1|Honestly, nobody does it better..
65351|0|Johnson might have diverted some of his CGI budget to hire a writer to come up with a story with some internal logic -- then he could match the effects to the story rather than vice versa.
47367|1|All this helps to shape P√°lfi's crudely bombastic but impressive philosophical view of the body as landscape and art, a source of personal discovery, wonder, and annihilation.
49532|1|Shows how love leads away from reason into the mysteries of the heart.
27026|0|What you get in Radio Flyer is an unholy brew of whimsy and blasphemy. It flits from the unwatchable to the unbelievable, with nary a pause between them and the effect, to say the least, is unsettling.
7816|0|The only thing the lowly Hills 2 has going for it is the grossness, ferocity, and superhuman strength of the rampaging mutants. I mean, these guys put the ugh in ugly; they make the original's Michael Berryman look like a hunk.

1883|1|Luis Bu√±uel's 1972 comic masterpiece, about three well-to-do couples who try and fail to have a meal together, is perhaps the most perfectly achieved and executed of all his late French films.

68932|1|"Hulk Hogan an alien? I suspected as much. Watch for the cameo by Mark ""Undertaker"" Callaway."
19703|0|A film whose pacing gives new meaning to the term 'sluggish,' and actually makes the charismatic Owen seem boring.
7748|1|This cross between Schindler's List and Hogan's Heroes works better than it has any right to, but not as well as most people would have you believe.
70162|1|Lest all of this sound gravely symbolic, be assured that the film is, before anything else, deliciously funny and deeply affecting. And beautiful, oh so beautiful, as a work of coherent art.

41512|1|Characters you can enjoy watching and will care about, places you will enjoy spending time, and a charming, hopeful look at love amid the vagaries of life.
32196|1|The film is extremely well cast. Topher Grace and Dennis Quaid work brilliantly together, to the point where you feel genuine affection for both characters.
3416|1|It may not be art, but it's vastly more entertaining than anything Coppola senior has done in far too long.
62174|0|Babbit starts with loud caricature and lathers on a lecherous tone with a lesbian subtext.
54172|0|The movie isn't going anywhere, but it goes in circles at top speed.
59554|1|Devoted film- and music-lovers alike will enjoy the latest reconstruction (images and sound) of Fritz Lang's truly marvellous tale of mediation over violence.
13059|0|A tedious melodrama stuck on top of shrill comedy, and the two parts are both the worse off for the combination.
25389|0|Sappy, forced, artificial and manipulative--but really well ACTED!
32333|1|High Noon isn't really a masterpiece, and if you're a fan of more honest Westerns, it's hard not to notice Zinnemann's general lack of interest throughout. But it is a tense, effective little film.
66391|1|... a workmanlike film and important in that it will reach a large audience with a story that needs to be told.

229|1|Many jokes cracked me up.
64417|1|The monochromatic palette suggests the kitchen-sink heyday of 1960s British cinema; fittingly, 'Control' is at its best when it concentrates on the quotidian.
16914|1|A moving, strangely pantheist assertion of what it really means to be alive. A pulp masterpiece.
7289|1|This film is stunning to look at, with wonderful sets, interesting costumes, and yet another work of gorgeous cinematography by Bergman fave, Sven Nykvist.
14132|0|This lacklustre espionage thriller is bogged down with the sort of clich√©s you'd expect from the height of the Cold War.
67822|1|A lightweight, but highly enjoyable buddy cop movie elevated by its two lead stars.
2507|1|Zany, near surrealistic humor and good musical numbers make pleasant entertainment.
79854|1|Eastwood registers strongly as actor and director of this revenge Western (yet another critique of High Noon), with a style that's influenced by his mentors, the economic efficiency of Don Siegel with touches of Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns
48797|1|One of the most important films in the history of British cinema.
2655|0|With mom's parasols and dad's water wheel inventions, this family looks like the original inhabitants of Gilligan's Island. Of course, this is not meant to be a comedy...

6136|1|Rarely has a film used London's landmarks so cannily.
74295|0|The long shadow of David Fincher's Seven falls on Anamorph, a moody, ultimately unexciting thriller.
61799|1|Prestigious, well turned out piece of British historical drama with enough genuine intrigue and wit to persuade some audiences they aren't watching a history lesson.

66542|0|For me, 3 Ninjas had its amusing moments but was also tedious at times.
37904|1|It's a toss-up whether She Done Him Wrong or this is Mae West's purest, most uncensored film. Both are essentials, but I'm No Angel is undeniably the more elaborate.
57601|0|When Meadows's three-minute sketch persona is stretched out to cover a whole movie, the cracks soon start to show.
8092|1|A film that treats its audience as adults, this is an extremely rewarding work that handsomely pays off the concentration required to watch it.
74824|1|Fortunately, Dillon was smart enough to hire one of our best living crime authors Barry Gifford to co-write the screenplay.
71908|1|Sentimental but occasionally moving drama.
64075|1|Late in the day Hitchcock, but pretty damn good.
11846|1|It's kind of a road movie and kind of a science fiction movie and kind of a look at those unsung heroes who repossess cars amid the haze of serious drug use.
69864|1|Breaker Morant is a top-notch film about an injustice in the annals of military history.
22473|1|The film reminds us of where great cinema comes from
54905|1|This generational touchstone remains a playful widescreen fable of the bestiality that defines and destroys cultures.
14341|0|Because Re-Animator is so poorly acted and directed (by Stuart Gordon, whose first film this is), there is no tension to break. So the gruesome scenes are just clinical and dull.
66982|1|Magnificent biopic of painter, gripping and inventive
49126|0|I couldn't have karaoked less about it.
14427|0|Lee has a small, intimate talent; here, he goes for the big podium and blows it.
17370|0|Director Peter Howitt shows a facility for reducing an intriguing premise to lowest-common-denominator fodder for network TV.
80383|1|It feels like Waller poured all the inspiration he ever had into one movie. But for a film forged through a favor and trial-by-fire moviemaking, it earns its place in the panoply of '90s psychological thrillers that throw you for a loop or six.
4215|1|The script efficiently contrives a spiral of dilemmas and challenges to bring about Josie's ultimate blossoming.

52626|1|Death Proof doesn't simply comment on its genre inspirations - it adds to their very legacy.
62926|0|So blatantly takes every bit of its formula to the furthermost extremes, it becomes a comedy.

79604|1|Makes the greedy rich who buy and sell ordinary folks' futures seem almost lovable.
7013|1|There is a sense of pride in these dancers. They are showing what they can do, not simply mimicking someone else.
4866|1|The homage to nature pic appeals to youngsters and boy adventurers, but left me yearning for a safer story for a 13-year-old boy.

2281|1|A gripping and messy ode to the collision of genres, time periods, and personalities.
2320|1|A powerful film made with minimal means, it's a story of poor people on the fringes of society, done without sentimentality or condescension but with wicked humor.
11588|1|Pure popcorn pleasure for older teens and up.
7773|1|Thornton's directorial style is one of careful, loving devotion.
73281|0|Intended as an artistically serious feature film about real-life eroticism, Zandalee -- for reasons no doubt mysterious to its makers -- turned out so laugh-out-loud loopy it went straight to video shelves.
11797|0|It's often genuinely funny -- but it's still an establishment picture pretending it's not.
12004|1|This charming comedy shows sensitivity to American peculiarities and eccentricties in spite (or may be because) of the fact that it was scripted by a writer of foreign descent and helmed by a Brit, Peter Yates.
19711|0|A slog through endless death metal-powered action sequences.
46804|0|Neither as outright funny nor as resonant as it seems to want to be.
47137|1|The combined talents of cast and crew create a new take on an enduring drama that pairs nicely with a side order of kitsch.

37836|0|Utterly pointless sequel that fails to generate even a single laugh.

72411|0|Violent film for Ice Cube. He can do better.
19664|1|A moving, faithful retelling of a bizarre true story.
49311|1|As a thriller it's solid three-star tension. As a Samuel L. Jackson showcase it proves a man can only coast through so many motherfuckin' or milquetoastin' turns before having to display his full and overpowering talent.
82041|1|A sweet and harmless family film.
59811|0|Maybe there are only two kinds of people in this world. Those who think Larry the Cable Guy is funny, and those who do not. I am in the latter camp.

34788|1|Formulaic kid-gets-whipped-into-shape by his ne'er-do-well uncle flick with Wood and Hogan offering likable enough performances to offset the charm of that wonderful dolphin.
33728|1|Despite a belated drift towards sentimentality, this remains a refreshingly intimate movie.
55384|0|It's standard horror fare -- with one interesting effect that turned up again, 12 years later, in The Conversation.
19142|0|While his hero is conscience-stricken about killing, Emmerich sure enjoys serving it up in generous helpings.

17770|1|A film that tries to mix full-out Brit humor with some deep messages about men trying to get their feelings of self-worth back. Unfortunately, it's oil and water.

2611|1|Anderson's gentle parody of westerners who lob into an ancient culture expecting to pick up enlightenment and peace as easily as a shoe shine or over-the-counter painkillers is very funny.
74732|1|Along with Night of the Living Dead and The Last House on the Left, it ushered in the modern age of horror in the 1970s. It is one of the great transgressive American horrors and is still the film upon which Hooper's reputation is built.
10038|1|An uproariously funny, marvellously malicious performance from Turner.
13966|1|This is the most bizarre comedy in many a month, a movie so dark, so cynical and so funny that perhaps only Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner could have kept straight faces during the love scenes.

6517|0|Irresponsible content notwithstanding, it's the low standard of filmmaking that really defies belief.
78117|0|Had it stuck to the ground rules it laid out early on, it would've made sense.
7131|1|It's sweet and harmless and very well meaning.
1345|1|Captures an aura of existential despondence that's married to a far less evocative (and durable) strain of counterculture romantic doom.
9363|0|Other than being a pleasant and enjoyable film, it doesn't really have much to say about relationships.
42957|0|I am aware that virtually every critic in America if not on the planet has lauded Hoffman's portrayal of the author and that I am in the minority. Watching Hoffman I felt something primal was missing from his interpretation ... To my mind, Hoffman's work
66632|1|This is a film that abounds in smart touches.
70238|1|If it's a mindless roller-coaster thrill ride that you fancy, this is the vehicle that knows how to make it a fun ride.
47097|1|First Blood is ragged and flashy; it ought to be a big success with audiences that value action for its own sake.
45211|0|A supremely difficult book becomes an easy film, and struggles hard to find a reason to exist.
5968|1|Elements of self parody from the master of slapstick leave you yearning for the early work that made his name. But it's worth a watch to see Chaplin and Keaton in one of few on-screen appearances together.
44270|0|If the idea of watching Leonardo DiCaprio pout for 90 minutes gives you sweaty palms, by all means go.
27899|1|One of the more ethically dubious films to come out of Hollywood in years.
60751|1|How could the creator of Blue, the story of a woman who grieves by moping around Paris in a chichi haircut, possibly have followed it with such a rich, light-handed marvel?
13817|1|"Seeing the film twice reveals two completely different viewer perspectives -- a kind of ""before and after"" syndrome -- and like any good film The Crying Game grows richer as it sinks into your thoughts."
79165|1|Set in a Christian high school, Saved! is a message film in the guise of a social satire. The film,however, is not as wickedly funny as it wants to be.
4285|1|Overall, it feels like Crystal, De Niro, and director Ramis have settled into a familiarity with the material and each other that allows for richer comedic chemistry and improvisation.
41327|1|The work of a warped wizard.
12019|1|a watershed film that discusses an important societal development
13654|1|The problems and characters it reveals are universal and involving, and the film itself -- as well its delightful cast -- is so breezy, pretty and gifted, it really won my heart.
68903|1|A masterpiece that should be viewed by movie buffs, and film students alike.
67445|0|Give the kids a break; take them to something else.
59913|1|A shrewd but spiky satire about corporate bureaucracy and Japanese social stratification.
6593|1|The sizzling combination of Elvis Presley and Ann-Margaret is enough to carry Viva Las Vegas over the top.
10896|1|The Wild Bunch is an American masterpiece, one of the greatest films ever produced in the Hollywood system.
8733|1|Potboiler Hong Kong cop drama with a fairly interesting plot about moral dilemmas and mixed allegiances.
46771|1|But when we look at this film, it signals a feeble turn towards art house eroticism which is tame by today's standards. For as Maria Schneider herself says ', we've seen much worse'.
26947|1|Grier, a statuesque actress with a body she doesn't hesitate to show, is strongly cast. Booker Bradshaw as a city politician and William Elliott as an honest cop score well.
5847|1|Troupe members Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones helmed this feature, bringing to it a visual style that is both cinematic and outrageously surreal.
81333|0|Bloated and overlong...
73462|0|Seeing WWJB? in a theater is not necessary, although seeing him and the choir hijacking a mall in person would be better than Beowulf in IMAX.
69795|1|Nothing to be embarrassed about here. Though the kick-in-the-balls scene does run on a bit.
15722|1|This is a strong drama that simmers its way to a boil by the end of the film. It falters only at the very end, in which the story falls back on a clich√©.
20553|1|Like anyone given over to giggling more than griping, Poppy - and as an indirect result, Happy-Go-Lucky - slowly becomes addictive.
10700|0|Sobieski's performance in this role pretty much kills off the film.
33843|1|Overrated cult comedy isn't nearly as funny as it thinks it is.
78313|1|Many directors worked on this Western and it's impossible to tell whose signature it bears; the final, overheated shootout between the lovers (Gregory Peck and Jennifer Jones), is preposterous but worth the ticket price.
54720|1|The film has good actors and enough quirky moments to keep it interesting.
42470|1|An intense, challenging and complex experimental psychological drama.
62698|1|Here, Cronenberg is a provocateur only to a point - boldly striding past boundaries of comfort but getting the heebie-jeebies upon approaching true profundity. But he wasn't too far from figuring out which incisions could cut the deepest.
16243|1|It is a well-directed, polished romantic comedy with top-notch acting talent.
12255|0|As is often the case with Cronenberg, the intriguing subtext (here, the damage caused by divorce and the dubious benefits of psychology) is neutered by an amateurish and even risible storyline as well as inconsistent characters who make little sense.
7353|0|...its defining trait is insistence.
13625|0|[Aniston] has the rare gift of getting you to root for her in the most trying of circumstances, a quality that will stand her in good stead when she progresses to better material.
57285|0|Self-fondling Americana
68497|1|Parker's visual synthesis with the music, much aided by Scarfe's rip-roaring visions of doom and destruction which turn light into darkness at the flick of a pen rather than a switch, is almost perfect.
58169|1|What makes Camp such a delight are the kids, any one of whom could kick your favorite American Idol star's butt.
26089|1|A fascinating, beautifully photographed portrait of a vanished community: a group of homeless people who built a shanty town in the train tunnels beneath Penn Station.
7248|0|Director O'Haver fails to supply any proper shape or development.
23058|1|Trash comedies such as this are usually more painful than funny, but writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber pulls enough hilarious gags and cameos out of his gym bag to qualify his first feature as the summer√¢(TM)s first guilty pleasure.
8647|1|The movie looks pretty cheap, but with Ray Milland and Donald Pleasance as villains, it's still a lot of fun.
36976|0|Trashy and exploitational. Clark comes off like a skuzzy pornographer taking advantage of his cast while using a faux v√©rit√© excuse as his accomplice.
46009|1|It has the rough, penciled-in feel of a sketch, flurries of palpable physicality left along the path of a dissolving relationship
73289|1|Epic in scope and imagery, the film is a haunting look at mankind's capacity for inhumanity, as well as survival.
14432|0|Sad, sad end to Peter Sellers' great movie career. Lackluster at best.
11362|0|It's for those who remember the days when the bad guy at school wasn't just the bully in the next seat, but an ex-jock whose life peaked when they were 17 and who now possesses the authority that comes with age, position and a whistle.
79945|0|A spectacular train wreck of a film where the participants seem oblivious to the dreck they've crafted and performed in.
22009|1|Simple-minded though it is, it's wonderful entertainment.
23507|0|Director Chuck Russell also made the infinitely better comedy The Mask. After this, he may want to wear a mask.
69949|1|Fine, vintage Harryhousen, but it's too old for when it came out.
8416|0|wasn't he insane?
3332|0|I hope we get a true closer to the series, someday.
10962|1|Has the usual charm that has made the Muppets so popular.
64424|1|A vitally important lesson, told in bland charts and alarming images.
34775|0|A chore to watch, The Kid and I is self-congratulatory, excruciatingly sentimental and sloppily written and directed.
35542|0|Green for Danger is just another proof that the British, too, can make mediocre pictures.
80880|1|Revolutionary Road's portrait of a disintegrating marriage is so unflinching, so unsentimental, and so bleak, that you really need to be in a buoyant emotional state to get through the movie.
49120|1|Despite obvious weaknesses, however, the film gets a huge boost from several excellent performances.
56093|0|Okay for forgiving romance fans, and a maybe-see for the rest of us.
74299|1|The film is a hot-wired crime thriller that captures [Jim] Thompson's flair for hard action, malicious wit and fevered eroticism.
61071|1|Oddball comic look at the disaster of Communism
8070|0|A lousy movie without a single laugh.
77729|0|The jokes tend to be watered-down versions of the tasteless kind that enlivened the Naked Gun movies and the early films of Mel Brooks.
13581|1|Directors K√°tia Lund and Fernando Meirelles stir all the cinematic virtues into this finely-crafted narrative.
8272|1|Aniston is the breeze in this movie.
71117|1|What could have been a sci-fi horror classic is instead just a better-than-average children's adventure story.
44336|0|Undermines its central mystery while posing another: 'What in God's name is this film trying to say?'
18253|1|"By the time Campbell and her partner pair off for ... ""My Funny Valentine,"" the film has become a love letter to the expanding the limits of artistic expression"
19021|0|The same old grab for the wallet.
35354|0|They may find themselves mystified and a little bored by a movie designed to leave their adult companions misty-eyed.
29737|1|A rare example of an entry into this genre that attempts to be honest and unique.
77204|1|Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers are particularly shoved to the side in this outing...
7197|0|It's pretty obvious where director Ronnie Yu's sympathies lie. Still, he can't find a satisfactory resolution to that old teaser about an implacable force vs the immovable object: how to kill off your cash cow and milk her too.
13610|0|The film that not only made me give up on Brian DePalma -- the man can't make a good movie anymore -- but it also made me doubt the judgement of Nicolas Cage and Gary Sinise.
61150|1|Deliciously turbulent.
37397|1|Sideways is the first of Payne's films in which we have the chance to really care for the characters; he reins in his harsh satire better than before.
4416|1|A gentle reminder of just how much life and movies have changed -- not entirely for the better.
17691|1|Highly recommended as an engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and the elements which contributed to it.
3284|1|...will likely leave you smiling throughout.
12749|1|A smart, nuanced spy thriller that's all about the gray areas.
11926|1|A gripping and well-made thriller that preserves Shyamalan's winning streak and shows us, as all the best films do, a world that we're familiar with and believe in, and yet we've never seen, and by which we're endlessly fascinated.
70798|1|While retaining his boyish appeal, Mr. Fox also seems a shade more substantial this time, possibly because he is seen making life-or-death decisions when not fielding comic lines.
74060|0|Hard to watch -- not because of its unflinching realism, but rather for its mawkish reliance on every boy hooker flick from Midnight Cowboy to Johns.
74209|0|...the requisite happy ending smacks of studio interference...
14767|1|Ken Russell's searing drama about life and sex in America.
11228|0|If you hear someone deriding Superbad for being unoriginal or derivative, sit them in front of College. If they can't tell the difference, they're a lost cause.
58277|0|This bittersweet, autumnal heartwarmer about two middle-aged people getting a last chance at love and happiness exceeded my personal tolerance factor for gloop and gush - but not by too much.
80027|1|This terrific movie, about one man's quest for vengeance, does everything a thriller is supposed to do: intrigue, involve and keep you guessing.
63316|0|An effort which will join True Lies and Raw Deal in the dustbin of Schwarzenegger history.
21347|1|Singer's grainy... photography lends the film the evocative aura of something that has been unearthed, while the spare, haunting soundtrack by DJ Shadow perfectly captures the sense of otherworldliness that pervades this remarkable film.
47109|1|For all its modest charm, Dave is a true throwback to the Capra days, a political comedy just cockeyed enough to triumph over cynicism.
78415|0|The situation and humor are sitcom quality at best.
10664|1|Travolta's warmth and expansiveness effectively amplify and embellish the likable and personable side of Stanton.
59026|1|Shambling but mostly knowing and funny.
57119|0|Not since Gump has there been such a pandering, faux-virtuous package of populist pap for Hollywood to shove in the faces of electioneering politicos and say: Look, we don't just market unwholesome swill to families, we market wholesome swill, too.
68506|0|The insects have obnoxious, piping little voices and sound like the Chipmunks had inhaled helium.
32084|1|This isn't the best film by Oliver Stone, but it is a first-rate job nonetheless.
54578|0|If Take My Eyes explored how a woman could still feel for a man who abused her, it might have gripped us with its difficult truths.
25845|0|The story is passable, albeit a little too manufactured for my taste in terms of its moral lessons, but the execution is so stilted and unconvincing that the experience is uncomfortable
33492|1|Helped immeasurably by the voices of Phil Harris, Eva Gabor, Sterling Holloway, Scatman Crothers and others, plus some outstanding animation, songs, sentiment, some excellent dialog and even a touch of psychedelia.
82035|1|[Julia Roberts] is at her vibrant best.
25520|1|With a fine appreciation for the nuances of polite repression, Sautet makes a quiet, careful study of these two lonely people.
29144|0|This hopelessly redundant action gross-out aspires to a form of hip vacuousness -- and may achieve it.
20233|1|You only needed one look at the poster for Step Brothers to know exactly what this film would be like.
43803|0|"This is one clumsy cannabis comedy that couldn't give the late Timothy Leary a natural high worth experiencing! Nip this ""joint"" session in the bud!"
56853|0|Not much to get excited about here.
27145|0|The film-within-a-film narrative device falls flat because the inner story is a melodrama with no comic momentum of its own.
51342|1|"There's no major message in this Cookie, only a fortune that reads, ""You will have a good time."""
1177|0|Picking up where the first film ended, writer-director Roth adds two angles to his formula, but neither is enough to make this grisly film worth watching.
62244|1|Laughton is compelling from the first instant: His Pengallan is at least five of the seven deadly sins rolled into one, a cheerfully loathsome creature with wide-set eyebrows and a multitude of chins ...
9602|0|Denise Gentile tries her best to save the picture but can't. The writing is too loose and the other acting is credible only in fits and spurts.
55242|0|Amazing Grace proves to be an invaluable history lesson, but a rather boring film.
10956|1|the picture had it's moments, I had my share of chills and as I said ... good point.
73246|1|Wonderful performances steal the show in this film based on the real life of Karen Silkwood.
80276|1|I think it's one of the best movies of the year.
41917|0|Transsiberian makes suspenseful and sometimes violent gestures, but it's all decoration.
40108|0|The movie bogs down and the humor seems to dry up, though the blood continues to well, spurt and spew.
8813|1|Toby Jones' uncanny portrayal of the short, effeminate writer with the funny voice, gives the film its credibility and compassion.
71547|1|A blessed reminder of just how good -- and how pointed -- British comedies can be.
52483|1|A funny and touching teen romance from Scottish director Bill Forsyth.
489|1|Artfully directed, professionally performed and just twisty enough to make viewers get lost in the overtly Hitchcockian trappings...
62063|1|While lacking the richness of its source material, it remains an enjoyable, immoral and sometimes beautifully Gothic tale.
70661|1|Though a meditative, introspective film, Scorsese's distinctive techniques cause Kundun to pulse with life under its calm surface.
14654|0|What a piece of tripe (no offense to tripe)!
5076|1|Dizzily paced and structured, the Irish import Intermission charms with a never-let-'em-see-you-sweat exuberance
18477|0|I say this without qualification - Johnny Mnemonic is a bad movie.
1992|1|Directed with a nimble, savvy touch.
23890|1|Although Flushed Away is on a much bigger scale than its homely predecessors, it's still comfortably offbeat and funny.
8086|1|A picture as charmingly insubstantial as the world it invokes.
8378|1|In its wrenching shift from farce to tragedy, and its evocation of the bridge offered by friendship, Talk to Me tells it, and keeps on tellin' it, much as 'Petey' Greene would have.
23953|1|Basically, this is almost perfect realization of the movie you eagerly anticipated when, as a kid, you saw some poster or coming attractions trailer for a 1950s-style alien invasion movie ...
39755|1|Well done, but finally airless modern noir.
8246|1|Overly gimmicky and ultimately frustrating it may be, but at its best The Nines feels like a triple-bill of 'Twilight Zone' episodes written by Charlie Kaufman - creepy, oddball and clever.
10931|0|Lacked suspense.
19590|1|The film works well despite its predictability, perhaps because of it.
57509|0|Standard yahoo fare, full of unshaven rednecks, high-speed car chases, and countless vehicles that conveniently burst into flame at the slightest provocation.
65383|0|Jeff Maguire, in adapting Crichton's novel, clearly had trouble explaining all the nuances of the story with the constraints of a Hollywood time limit.
71032|0|As entertainment, An American Carol ranks below YouTube clips of Sarah Palin.
22635|0|This is one of those what-could-they-have-been-thinking movies.
63624|0|The acting is so bad that apparently none of the performers ever got another job in the movies, and the costumes in Ben Hur seem less dated that those on display here.
15958|0|The characters are united in an ability to be more boring than anybody who went to high school in the real world.
17401|1|The execution is state-of-the-art and breathtaking. Titanic offers the full compass of courage and cowardice, and it stands as an achievement that truly is a night to remember at the movies.
51041|1|In David Mamet's world nothing is what it seems and nobody talks like a real person. The stylized dialogue is not a flaw--it's part of the entertainment. Mamet keeps you and star Campbell Scott guessing until the final moments.
55927|0|The production is grimy and listless, without any color to be seen, literal or figurative -- not even those little red dots meant to deter piracy. But then, there's not much danger of that.
5019|1|Whimsical, knockabout and slightly out there, it's an enticing watch and one which more adventurous young audiences won't find too alien.
77682|1|Impressively directed with superb special effects, this is an action-packed fantasy flick that's actually more fun than the first film.
66160|1|"A close second to ""American Werewolf in London."""
2974|1|Percy Adlon's first English-speaking film is a charming fable about the friendhsip between two vastly different women.
34399|1|Hope, desperation and the ugliness of ethnic cleansing intersect elegantly in director Elie Chouraqui's intense retelling of the 1991 Croatian-Serbian conflict in Yugoslavia.
4322|1|It will most definitely divide audiences, having already done so all over the world. But Laugier has contributed a brave, brutal and original horror film for all to witness.
42015|1|Such an unalloyed joy is this Anglo-Irish comedy that it recalls the great Ealing classics of the '50s.
79871|1|Proof, the best in the filmmaker's career, that a movie doesn't need to bend over backwards for Meaning to be absolutely great.
14439|0|The opening narration by Christopher Walken starts sucking the life out of the film before it gets a chance to gain any momentum.
35689|1|Chris Farely at his best.
6795|1|...a solid, consistently entertaining piece of work that boasts a typically stellar performance from Harrison Ford.
49888|0|The film is more like an infomercial in which the pitchman is also the product.
81397|0|The comedy wannabe has the lamest, most predictable banter of any recent movie.
61107|0|The plot moves along so that a mandatory fight scene is sure to pop up every fifteen minutes to make sure the audience isn't snoozing, but Lam manages to botch at least half of these scenes with shaky camerawork and scrappy editing.
28692|0|The upper lips aren't the only things that are stiff in this broad British comedy--so are most of the jokes.
50918|0|A bland affair with a few clever twists here and there.
80404|1|Goodfellas is a terrifying film because, like much of Scorsese's best work, it is about the lives of avuncular psychopaths, and pretty-boy Liotta brilliantly encapsulates that fetid contradiction.

66740|1|stands alongside Amarcord as an earlier reminiscence of Fellini's life in Rimini
26392|1|Dial M is less a filmed play than a highly cinematic investigation of theatricality.
284|0|Poor Joe Pantoliano, Kid Rock, and Joanna Cassidy get mixed up in the flatulence.
44150|1|The Snapper sees its characters with warmth and acceptance, and earns its laughs by being wise about human nature.
12355|1|So finely tooled that it feels like it ought to be bound in Morocco leather and placed on a display case in a department store for a last minute Christmas gift.
22665|1|Though it garnered little attention in theaters, it has become a cult favorite on video.
15183|1|Even viewers who've never given a serif a second thought are in for an exclamation point of joy from such a well-designed doc.
16969|0|Girl 6 is entertaining and at times quite funny. But about halfway through it seems to run out of ideas.
81029|0|Shyamalan fancies himself a philosopher whose stories have deep and important meanings that need to be conveyed to audiences as slowly and heavy-handedly as possible.
1040|1|Good-natured '90s comedy loaded with pratfalls, silliness.
59300|1|The earned payoff is an all-too-believable shocker.
51525|1|[Pierre] Boulanger joins Keisha Castle-Hughes of Whale Rider as one of this year's strongest juvenile performers.
32661|1|A not-very-good movie redeemed by a car chase for the ages.
11256|0|If Crichton meant Looker as a satiric comedy, as he says he did, it doesn't come off as a very pointed or very funny one.
52843|1|It is a subtle and revealing drama about a confidence game filled with on-target insights into business, paranoia, deceit, pride, and entitlement.
58004|1|Clint Eastwood is at his macho, insubordinate best in this exuberant, salty military movie with more memorable lines and funny moments than most comedies.
3307|0|The dialogue in The Comebacks is bereft of lines that trigger even a snicker.
57729|0|Everyone knows that assaults on cherished American symbols never end well for the assailants.
51083|1|[A] refreshing, unexpectedly profound comedy.
78730|0|Audiences may wonder why a picture with Robert De Niro, Kathy Bates and Harvey Keitel would be so bereft of hype. After you've endured the film, all 120 airless minutes, you'll understand the rationale behind the quiet release.
36275|0|The trio of credited writers exhibits a complete failure of imagination!
57373|1|What also makes 28 Days Later effective, and sets it apart from other thrillers, is that it makes you care about the characters.

8718|0|The movie's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating, though, even if the movie itself doesn't stand a ghost of a chance.

75333|0|Everybody on-screen seems awfully bored.
44671|1|The success of 1408 rests squarely on [John Cusack's] Hawaiian shirt-clad shoulders, and he pulls it off. The role, that is. The tacky shirt stays on pretty well the whole time.
50836|0|For what's essentially a raucous, gross-out comedy, this is a surprisingly tame film.
14083|0|Nothing but glossy fluff.

17810|1|A wonderfully funny film debut; from the outset Kevin Smith takes us into his askewed world, and we love it. And I wasn't even supposed to be at work today.
14615|1|DeMille remains conventional with the motion picture as an art form. The eyes of the onlooker are filled with spectacle. Emotional tug is sometimes lacking.
9241|1|Happily, director/star/co-producer Gary Sinise has approached it not with the awe of an English professor, but with the practical eye of a craftsman: Here are solid characters, a taut and emotional story, a beginning, a middle and a wrenching end.

74216|1|Amiable light rom-com.
51134|0|Uneven and slightly muddled futuristic horror story -- not really science fiction, more like an antipollution PSA gone berserk.

6522|0|A slightly amusing mainstream coming-of-age rom/com directed by Rob Reiner.
39661|0|Goes for cheap laughs with its politics, but wins back at least some respect when it presents its central characters as real people and their issues as immune to instant cure.
44696|0|Animation is a wonderful medium, but it's almost too compatible with Burton's uninhibited approach. When literally anything goes, even the most original idea can get lost in the creative shuffle.
2029|0|This might have been tailor-made by director Pollack to ease Ford into more straightforwardly romantic territory.
30159|1|As visually lush and distinctive and enveloping as you would expect from a Wong Kar-wai film, with space for performances that have impact.

8947|0|'An irritating, disjointed mess that can never decide what kind of film it wants to be.'
36134|0|Myers and Roach are running dangerously close to empty as far as new and genuinely funny ideas, and they would be best off quitting before they fall any farther behind.
59366|1|I would have hated being a stuntman on this movie!
63759|1|Still, this is a decent little diversion, the kind of pure popcorn fodder that would find a far more ballsy form when Will Smith took on city-sized flying saucers in Independence Day.
1316|1|A touching love story
10027|0|The film feels superficial, with all its glib characters provoking an air of chic fashion.
75496|1|I don't care if it's a weekend-long slice of life in an incredibly scenic hick town with no major plot line; in fact, that's what I liked most about it.
32983|1|All the cast members, even Mr. Pitt, adopt the obligatory British accent, sans contractions, employed by the historical drama genre, even though the action takes place in Ancient Greece.
10022|0|Nutty Professor II will still make money, somehow, this summer. That doesn't mean it's a good movie.

69955|1|Excellent but too mature for the littlest kids.
18586|0|Treads a well-traveled road and needs more than a chicken to be distinctive -- it needs a sense of transcendence, a reason to endure its sadness.
19063|0|Rent-A-Cop tried to recapture the magic that Reynolds and Minnelli shared in Lucky Lady (1975), but instead succumb to being one of the cheesiest action flicks of all time
74169|1|"One of the more ""mature"" teen comedies from the 80s."
22045|0|A fast-moving, often lightheartedly amusing and occasionally touching treatment of its star, but a searing 60 Minutes segment it's most definitely not.

11882|1|The theatrical antics are a bit forced and the musical numbers aren't the best in the history of musical cinema, but this still stands as an 'important' film of its era, albeit a minor and relatively forgettable one.
20998|1|Shampoo, made in 1975 but set in 1968, the night before Richard Nixon's election to the presidency, was directed by Hal Ashby and written by Robert Towne and Warren Beatty, who may have produced one of the best scripts in the last three decades.

75067|1|The clumsily executed climax reduces the quality of the film considerably.
13761|0|Instead of being a merciless evisceration of the lifestyles of the rich, it's a little morality play in which Long transforms herself into a warm and useful person. Nobody within a mile of this project seems to have possessed an ounce of irony.
44672|1|Ron Howard popcorn-muncher is sappy, not smokin'.

8119|1|It's certainly not a subtle movie, but with memorable performances, ludicrously over-the-top one-liners and amiable zaniness, it qualifies as a lot of fun.
40401|0|The cast is defeated by a cloying Barry Berman script that Jeremiah Chechik directs with the same flair for the obvious he brought to National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.

16269|1|Wisely, Bird and company eschew the standard Disney formula of catchy show tunes and cuddly animal sidekicks and lead Warner Bros. toward an animation style the studio can call its own.

49019|0|Fitfully entertaining hokum as long as it isn't taken too seriously¬Ö Remarkably, Disney doesn't whitewash the more politically incorrect elements of Hopkins' tale.
81824|1|Good God, I actually liked this screwball of a mystery thriller.
9180|1|See Orlando for its fabulous costumes, fascinating look at changing eras, and impressive performance by Tilda Swinton. Viewing this film for other reasons will almost certainly lead to a negative impression.
10379|1|Terrific, grounded performances by Natalie Portman as Novalee and Ms. Judd as Lexie are the saving graces of the movie.
11597|1|Dumps traditional war movie bravado in favor of a subtler touch, and softens the blow of an unspeakable ordeal by shooting it amidst a series of jarringly beautiful and poetic canvases.
63035|1|"As the U.S. elections media coverage becomes incessant, it's worth keeping in mind that actual listening to other ""sides"" can be enlightening."

40342|0|Choke is a confused sex comedy by Clark Gregg that blunders around for 90-odd minutes trying to look butch and sensitive.
5740|1|More a vestige of 1950s film scandal than a significant work based on its content.

7970|1|Twelve Brechtian tableaux chronicle the life and death of a whore, starting out as a documentary on prostitution, ending as a Monogram B movie.
47736|1|Regardless of its shortcomings, The Boys of Baraka introduces a project that seems to do for Baltimore what Jaime Escalante did for inner-city Latino kids in Los Angeles. For this we must be grateful.

80552|1|While Truffaut was fiddling with this trifle, the streets of Paris were burning with a student riot in May 1968.
55080|0|A ridiculous and just plain goofy romantic fantasy that's as flimsy as a slice of bologna.
3168|1|Often overwrought and at times positively irritating, the film turns into an engrossing thriller almost in spite of itself.
9253|1|Not surprising that it's more tragicomedy than yukfest.
60084|0|Unfortunately, the result is high melodrama, at once patronizing and predictable.
50505|0|Seriously undermined by the skeletal script, which barely develops the characters and unintentionally raises more questions about Kearns's quixotic battle than it answers.
81287|0|This is easily the most disappointing of the original...movies - which is quite an achievement when you consider that the overall quality of the franchise was hardly high enough to raise expectations to a level that would allow for disappointment.

42671|0|One of the most awful movies (if you could even call it a movie) this year.

6882|1|Terence Rattigan's old-fashioned melodrama is well-acted by the entire ensemble. Surprisingly, it was nominated for Best Picture and garnered Oscars for David Nivel as a Major with fake identity and Wendy Hiller as the reserved hotel manager.
34393|0|Everything in it is appropriated from somewhere else.
51764|0|"The brains behind Cartoon Network's ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"" have stretched their 12-minute plus commercials 'Adult Swim' series entry into 86 rather uneven ones."

36477|1|It's not just the screenplay, it's the performances and direction that make this film.
55370|0|Not a highlight of the series. Loses the fun feel of incompetent cops in a complicated citizen plot.
29786|1|This engrossing account of the nation's most perilous moon shot embodies what many people consider to be old-fashioned American virtues in a virtually pristine state.
34206|0|To Live and Die in L.A. is undeniably very well made - from the performances to the more technical aspects - but the bottom line is, it's just not all that compelling.
18535|0|This is the WB version of a baseball movie. Everyone is young, toned, sexually active and agonizes over their future.
50081|1|Hartley's three-part anthology, a semi-academic treatise about the limits of narrativity, offers some minor rewards.
6473|1|I enjoyed it, even if it creeped me out quite a bit.
16121|1|Easily one of the funniest (and most quotable) movies ever made...

45992|0|While there's nothing terribly wrong with it, there's not much that's memorable either.
5719|0|For all its beauty and artistic ambition, the film remained stubbornly remote and soulless to me.
14009|0|This is a movie that can't say no to a melodramatic opportunity, and whatever verisimilitude inspired Paul Kimatian and Christopher Gambale to write a script based on Kimatian's memories of the gangs has been utterly lost along the way.
79629|1|Delivers belly laughs as huge as Klump's waistline.
5891|1|This is a much more complex, ambiguous, and challenging film that most reduce it to.
71743|1|Al Pacino gives a touching performance as a dying old man in this sensitive little film.
8668|1|It's a warm and dignified end to a sometimes erratic but often enthralling career.
72686|1|It indeed feels 'new', moving out of Pixar's comfort zone while retaining the brand's populist virtues: loveable characters, crafted jokes, aw-shucks niceness and wonderful images.
47927|1|Slightly edgy medieval tale with rock music.
68532|1|A haunting series of heartbreaking duets between people for whom love is distant and death is uncomfortably close.
11022|1|Austin Powers has little on this Sixties spy spoof.
5613|1|Eastwood's brooding, bloody masterpiece.
62768|1|"I think that the power and the theme of the film lie in the fact that while some characters are more ""major"" than others, they are all subordinated to the music itself. It's like a river, running through the film, running through their life."
1683|1|Not a bad mid-90s sci fi flick - and with a young Sandra Bullock in spandex to boot!
950|1|The director's perenially heavy mood seems especially well suited to this indigo-shaded story of a black American saxman (Dexter Gordon) living and performing in Paris in the late 50s.
36397|0|Will be well-received on Sunday-school movie night at church, particularly during group discussions afterward. For the rest of us, alas, it doesn't quite hang together.
15786|1|There are no surprises in the direction, and Abby Mann's screenplay plays the expected tunes, but there's enough conviction on display to reward a patient spectator.
49945|0|Just a voyeuristic excuse to watch people die in different ways.

59441|1|A cute little movie whose success proves that wherever they can find it, people will rise up and embrace the most mediocre, bland, and reassuring forms of art.
24886|1|This is the purpose of the picture, to make one suffer and sympathize with them. Kurosawa's darkly imagistic technique achieves this depressing aim.

34324|0|The series was on its last legs with this offering.
41812|1|A laid-back, inoffensive time-waster.

40762|0|Go on the Disney ride instead. It's over sooner.
11305|1|Even Eastwood's Man With No Name is inspired, perhaps, by the samurai in Yojimbo.
22835|1|Factory Girl is an effective evocation of a particular slice of recent history. The film benefits from Miller's turn as Edie, an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink performance that takes the poor girl from the heights and highs of fame to the depths and doom
80898|0|If you're looking for a biting satire and smart commentary on male sexual misadventure, steer away from this movie.
37329|1|An imaginative sci-fi thriller, even though the effects don't hold up today.
81685|1|[Bennett's] quite convincing as she tries to figure out what has gone wrong in her personal life -- and how she can fix it before it is too late.
60364|1|The overkill is strangely compelling and Mailer's disregard for taste and convention ensure his film is a massive but spectacular and unmissable folly.
23068|1|Where the Sidewalk Ends offers what most audiences expect from a classic noir - cops, corruption, moody lighting, and a jazz-inflected soundtrack.
9061|0|Strange and haunting, but unduly disjointed.
14835|0|A contrived script and lackluster performances are the worst sins of this uninspired comedy.
21929|1|There's an undeniable formal elegance in the way Ferrara, who coauthored the script with Zoe Lund, frames and holds certain shots, and Keitel certainly gives his all.
11303|0|Humorous to an extent, but lacking the bang you might expect from a big screen musical.
51272|0|I guess we're supposed to like Swayze's character because, at heart, he's a good guy who only robs drug dealers and tells his kids to buckle up their seatbelts when he's driving so as to elude police.
45|0|It's like watching Univision or Telemundo on the big screen.
20876|0|He's Just Not That Into You is like reliving your 20s, without any of the fun.

28871|1|The backgrounds are as richly textured and detailed as in any other Disney film.
78231|1|embodies that lose-lose conundrum we all face: loneliness is painful, but finding and then losing love is just as bad
11370|1|The animation is kinetic and witty; computer effects are integrated to good effect without overwhelming the hand-drawn figures.
52092|1|Lavishly shot in the French Riviera, this romantic thriller is vatsly entertaining due to star power of Cary Grant and Grace Kelly.
1448|1|Superbly choreographed by Fosse, the cabaret numbers evoke the Berlin of 1931 - city of gaiety and perversion, of champagne and Nazi propaganda - so vividly that only an idiot could fail to perceive that something is rotten in the state of Weimar.
27714|0|The Boondock Saints, sorry to say, wasn't worth the trouble.
45223|1|From the carnage of a troubled shoot emerged Brosnan's best Bond, striking the correct balance of menace, thrills and humour, using a chase-movie template to ensure attention never wavers.
7346|1|Three years after 2046, Wong Kar-wai is not in love any more--and I for one am happy for him.
11819|0|Boasts Quentin Tarantino as co-executive producer but falls about as far from that particular tree as one can imagine.
23024|0|A so-so effort, with the gimmick of brothers playing brothers its only interesting aspect.
74842|1|Flawlessly acted and meticulously observed.
16059|1|This terrific film is fueled by several scenes that are shocking -- but not for the reasons you might think. The shocks here come not from the unexpected sensationalism of them but from their bracing humanity and spontaneous, eye-opening rawness.
65387|1|Exploits [headbanger] stereotypes in good fun, while adding a bit of heart and unsettling subject matter.
40561|0|Failing to get beyond trite Hollywood romantic conventions, sermonizing caricatures and 'I was just following orders' explanations does a great disservice to history.
50041|1|Flawed, but see it for Rita.
46218|1|Both emotionally and intellectually the picture is hypnotic, and some portions will nail the spectator to his seat.
8236|1|Circles and triangles govern Polanski's great, brackish anecdote about the instability of human interaction
14054|1|Most movies that criticize religion argue for the abolition of institutions. Chocolat suggests the problem lies in how people manipulate religion to get what they want.
13059|1|In a moviemaking world dominated by attention to secular matters, the parochial Wide Awake is a refreshing change of pace.
39573|1|... if you want a World War II story from a real vet's perspective, Sam Fuller is still the man and The Big Red One, drawn from his own war experiences, is the film
16991|1|Often funny film boasts no less then 10 film directors on screen in small roles. Stick around for the Paul McCartney penned title song.
3945|0|Not a very good film, but it does offer a few pleasant surprises, and I was not expecting that from a Steven Seagal flick.
66319|1|one fo the coolest movies ever
6220|0|...the script gives the actors virtually nothing to do and nothing to say in this subpar genre entry.
27513|0|It's disappointing to realize that the film truly IS nothing more than a series of people dying. We usually like our thrillers to have something more to them.
49098|1|As an adult drama, Dinner With Friends is apt enough at exploring late-thirtysomething angst and crisis, well acting and paced with enough momentum to keep the story from dragging.
55452|1|A masterpiece before it reached the screen and maybe the highest praise that can be offered in celebration of this film version is that it remains one.
40357|0|The film never gets too far beyond disposable youth fare, best consumed like mouthfuls of sugary cereal.
8435|0|Shun this witless showcase for the Saturday Night Live double act of Ferrell and Kattan.
2080|0|It's the type of film where people don't speak much, and when they do, you'll wish they would just shut up.
10094|0|Charlie Bartlett is a poor man's Rushmore. There is a great film waiting to be made about psychiatry, anti-depressants and our youth, but this isn't it.
36051|0|As befits the title, it dead-ends long before it's over.
3143|0|An odd bit of spiritual dithering, not really bad but not really good.
44988|1|Ratatouille is a wonderful, wistful comedy, and a sparkling return to form for the computer animation studio Pixar after last year's lacklustre Cars.
13045|0|As low- intelligence entertainment goes, this film is very much a hit-and-miss affair.
66388|1|Akroyd and Basinger give the film an infectious stroke of energy, and by the end we continue to smile even as we are exhausted under the weight of endless nonsense.
19712|0|With all the money and talent and hype that went into this film, it should have been a lot better, but it is entertaining enough to rate a passing grade, especially for Robin Williams fans.
62852|0|While certainly original, its hallucinatory terrain is basically weird for the sake of weird... and ultimately buckles under its own pretense.
32632|1|A truly remarkable film, that manages to excite and enthrall as well as offer deep, rounded characters.
68637|1|An absorbing character study of a paranoid loner. Hackman is superb.
54830|1|It is really a pleasure to watch a masterful actor like Al Pacino wring every nuance out of the multifarious character of Shylock.
5814|1|One of Hitchcock's more charming efforts.
37795|0|The first film was bad, the second worse, and the third almost unbearable.
56553|0|For all its competing aspirations, the movie just never clicks.
37117|1|Remains true to the Chekhovian flavor of this classic by Tennessee Williams.
55561|1|Great turn by Walter Matthau in aged makeup, and nicely directed by friend Jack Lemmon.
79162|0|Did about a third of the business of its highly successful predecessor, and contains only about a third of the laughs.
7852|0|"The only thing to ""catch"" in this film is perhaps a cold--from sitting in the theater with the 'tweener set."
51737|0|'Oh God, now I've got brains spattered all over me,' exclaims The Punisher's slippery inside man, Detective Soap. You may feel the same at the end of this messy, sadistic reboot of the Marvel comic-book series.
18338|1|Dimension-hopping has never been so exhilarating and breathlessly lyrical as brilliant visuals and bracing Hong Kong action stunts punch through lengthy streams of technobabble.
45510|1|Sally Field made us like her, really like her, as the scrappy, titular star of this unionization drama.
3790|1|"From scandalous Hollywood outcast to influential cult classic, Tod Browning's 1932 dark drama about (and starring) freak-show performers is now truly ""one of us""."
345|0|The Friday the 13th saga continues with this typically underwhelming entry...

26088|0|As a movie, this material, freely adapted by Stoppard, is boring and endless. It lies flat on the screen, hardly stirring.
16242|1|A well-acted, folksy, sentimental and respectable Civil War drama.
11727|1|A fantasy that... goes right in spite of its solemn style.
52879|1|It's a treat when a movie offers characters this rich and layered.
64569|1|The biggest problem with the film is that it's not as funny as it should be.
66349|1|While drawing superb performances from her young leads, Holland has masterfully contrasted the garden -- a place where melodic robins seem almost conversant -- with the dread of Misselthwaite.
1398|0|This sweet-natured but plodding adaptation of a young-adult novel by Carl Hiaasen could have used a little less broad satire of corporate greed and a few more, well, owls. The critters peep from their burrows for only a few brief moments.
17796|1|"Kevin Smith inserts enough of his special charm to make ""Jersey Girl"" a winner."
72059|1|A frank, honest portrayal of the sacrifices of Olympic-caliber athletes. it is tough and uncompromising.
3727|0|There's nothing special or memorable about this overlong endeavor, the first of two motion pictures to feature Bing Crosby's insufferably noble Father Chuck O'Malley.
34260|0|A potentially intriguing concept undone by flawed execution.
34297|0|The Farrellys take an artistic step backward with this soft, disappointingly sentimental comedy about the true nature of beauty; they seem to have forgotten their roots in the outrageous and gross-out.
12383|0|The centre does not hold
52202|0|There are a few too many plot holes and logical errors. Rising Sun may be solidly-paced, but not all aspects of the production are as successful.
44110|1|Jackass: Number Two aims low and hits lower, but is as hilarious and uncomfortable an encounter as possible.
57691|1|Captures the imagination even without a plot.
46586|1|It's hard to say which is more ravishing and alluring in the movie, Ms. Marozsan or the celebrated song.
63948|1|... like a French New wave film by way of Bela Tarr, directed with a hipster American comic sensibility and an outsider's fascination with the details of the everyday.

1582|0|Gives glib critics something to horselaugh about.
14128|0|So insubstantial as to barely register as an actual film.
25439|1|Mega-budget action extravaganzas don't get much sillier than this.
67919|0|Vaguely interesting for causing controversy at the time, this tacky tale of illicit teenage romance hasn't aged particularly well.
32917|1|The movie is inconsequential, floppy-eared, frisky, yet no dog.
39154|0|The title should be spoken with a grave shake of the head.
9469|1|A heavily symbolic and highly intellectual look at the bourgeois milieu and the effect that a mysterious visitor, Stamp, has on one specific family.
10811|0|I know, you couldn't make it up. But someone did.
71098|0|Charmless, stupid and badly made, No Holds Barred makes Rocky look like Citizen Pain.
42735|1|A remarkable breakout for Nicole Kidman, who gives this feminist thriller everything it deserves, and more.
22315|1|An imaginatively rendered and ultimately touching expression of the collision of creativity and responsibility, and the former bursting through the constraints of a small town outlook of diminished expectation.
24834|0|There are individual scenes that pack a real punch, but they are usually followed by something pretty heavy-handed or over-the-top.
12953|1|A gorgeous cough syrup hallucination -- the kind of beautiful, feverish dream to which you succumb while eardrum-piercingly high on over-the-counter cold medicine.
132|1|It lives on, haunting and creepy, an embodiment of the guilty soul of film noir. No one who has seen it has easily forgotten it.

19569|1|Renee Zellweger, previously best known as the sweet mom from 'Jerry Maguire,' delivers a quietly stunning performance in the lead.
80733|1|The unfussy, tossed-off quality actually helps give this original story zippy irreverence some of Disney's plusher cartoons lack.
65124|1|A magnificent documentary! I talked about it for seven days afterwards.
50164|1|Great caper comedy that deftly balances high-tech gadgets and character humor.
4679|0|The movie is a time-killer without a killer instinct.
15597|1|Shoot to Kill is a rip-roaring movie from start to finish.
45148|1|One of those movies that you watch when you've got nothing better to do, munching jelly babies and smiling at the exuberance on the screen
9196|1|The word 'unexpected' is a severe understatement when regarding the narrative genius of In Bruges.
72174|0|Not funny, suspenseful, or original.
17426|1|"Suprisingly funny lighthearted comedy dealing with divorce. Lackluster conclusion, but good ""feel good"" tone."
60128|0|Less spellbinding than it wants to be, losing its energy and occasionally its brains in long passages of surprisingly sentimental schmaltz.
28454|0|This is a travesty.
10464|1|A breezy film about the death of mankind in a way that only the '70s could have provided.
73566|1|This crowd-pleaser is filled with laughs.
73162|0|Chaplin generates little sympathy. His broad-mannered antics, as a many-aliased fop on the make for impressionable matrons.
79490|1|So much more than the ups and downs of one pool player--It's shot in a very realistic way and deals with inner conflict and what it means to be a man.
55162|1|When the film, as it frequently does, sticks to traditional dialog sans music, it quickly grinds to a halt.
19150|1|Pfeiffer gives a funny, scrappy performance that makes you feel a committed teacher's fire to make a difference.
4335|1|Strong adaptation of Chester Himes' pulp thriller
36987|1|The plotting is simplistic but cute and the gags are consistently funny, particularly for anyone who grew up in the 1980s.
26892|1|Before you think the filmmaker is one sick dude, he also develops scenarios to show how innocent women are deceived and trapped into witch accusations...
20727|0|The premise was sounder than the execution.
36642|0|No, it's not nearly as good as any of its influences.
55735|1|Vivid performances . . . the film's warmly luminous look and the richly rendered view of a troubled but talented teen's struggles with the adult world sustain the film.

51281|0|Bone tired.
16998|1|Disregard the incoherent ending, which violates the source material (Joyce Carol Oates story): in her debut, Chopra has made a disturbing tale of sexual awakening set against the 1980s new context of shopping malls; Laura Dern is extraordinary as the lead
48000|1|...a low-key yet sporadically fascinating drama...
10300|1|Mike Leigh's Naked is a great one -- a film of brutal impact, withering wit and humanity. It deserves one of the highest accolades movies can receive: Seeing it shakes you up, changes your vision.
64128|1|Haven't watched it in awhile, but I remember it well and I remember enjoying it. One of the better Vacation movies (Vegas Vacation is still the best, though).
19698|1|Jafar Panahi's film is disarming because it presents a mostly good natured, at times humorous, approach to issues that are extremely serious.
61352|1|Caramel is filled with more dignity, class, and realism than a Sex and the City could ever muster.

56006|0|Four screenwriters, including veteran TV producer Danny Jacobson, have cobbled together a script so rickety that it could itself pass as one of Ralph Kramden's harebrained get-rich schemes.
66724|1|A late radical shift in tone, from jittery exuberance to ruinous alienation, strikes an impressive contemporary note amid all the obeisance to custom.

31175|1|Okay, it's just a guy in a rubber suit. Even people in the 1950's weren't afraid of this so-called monster. But, there's some camp value to this on-the-water and under-the-water adventure.

64225|0|For a good laugh, check it out; for good action, look elsewhere.
22361|0|The emotional landscape is observed with detachment; you have to connect the almost hidden dots to empathise with the characters or form the message, and it's hard.

36875|0|Just Friends is sweet and mostly pleasant to pass the time with...but there's little justification to enter into a serious engagement with it.
16395|1|Unexpectedly entertaining, given that it's about dodgy accounting on an epic scale, the film predicts an economic cold shower that is about to douse America's prospects, thanks to its ever-expanding national debt.
689|1|For all the emphasis on its leads, Moonstruck is a brilliantly cast ensemble piece and two smaller supporting roles deserve a special mention.
75885|1|Though it fails as drama, Stanley Kubrick's venture succeeds as dazzling visual art.
17526|0|"While both [this movie and ""Karate Kid""] are unintentionally hilarious, the difference is no one will remember ""Never Back Down"" in two weeks, let alone 20 years."

48003|0|So thick with bad gas, it sours the show.

81089|1|Director Patrick Creadon has turned crossword puzzling into a spectator sport.
27189|1|This isn't a movie about big emotional breakthroughs, but about the slow thaw taking place in Juliette's heart, and writer-director Philippe Claudel and the actors do an excellent job in charting a series of small, telling steps forward.

415|1|Woody Allen's London-set comedy caper doesn't break any new ground, but he and Match Point muse Scarlett Johansson are good for some odd-couple laughs.
17882|1|Works like gangbusters, with its irresistibly corny opening theme song, larger-than-life performances, sweeping hyper-romance, perfectly-timed bombshells of plot twists.
74800|1|A richly tender and moving experience.
57213|1|Proves mainly that South Korean filmmakers can make undemanding action movies with all the alacrity of their Hollywood counterparts.
12663|0|The Promise is an over-wrought and laughably goofy film, an empty and pale imitation of the far better films that have gone on before it.
58962|1|It may seem a somewhat trite and corny affair when compared with today's definition of 'horror movies,' but this one has the market cornered on atmosphere.
5566|1|Sober, serious and rough. Nicholson's in rare form.
64878|1|I don't think I believed the movie Lucky You, but I sort of enjoyed it. A caveat: I enjoy watching poker on ESPN. If you don't, this movie will bore you.
52912|0|So how does a movie overcome a case of the been-there-done-thats? By throwing lots more of the same-old-same-old at its audience, that's how.
17178|1|Some Peckinpah devotees consider the film among his finest work, others regard it as, well, troubled. Fascinating, nonetheless.

52135|0|Every scene is so frantic and desperate to make you laugh, to be clever, to be naughty and none of it worked.
11621|1|Never coherent and frequently pretentious, the film remains an audacious attempt to place obsessive personal images before a popular audience -- a kind of Kenneth Anger version of Star Wars.
43491|1|If there was a list of movies about killer mutated sheep, this would undoubtedly be the best of the bunch.
66991|0|The plot seems to be nothing more than a translucent bridge to the next scene where Vaughn can run his mouth and Favreau can play off him as the longsuffering friend

12896|1|Amy Fox's play, with New York clich√©s for characters, was never going to hit, ahem, the movie heights. But cut loose in the middle of a comic-book summer, Heights is just different enough, just adult enough, to warrant a climb and a look.

24374|0|An intermittently hilarious, often painful and too frequently self indulgent documentary.
34909|1|Based on a Roald Dahl book, Nicholas Roeg's The Witches is a film surprisingly faithful to the creepiness of the original.
23715|1|Although lacking the lyric force of March of the Penguins and Winged Migration, the film combines a great story with world-class photography to tell a unique National Geographic tale.
72445|0|Unfortunately, while Jimmy Stewart provides yet another winning performance as the seminal big band leader, the film is an unsatisfying hybrid.
77321|0|There's no narrative, just half-hearted episodes punctuated by occasionally brilliant shtick.
7901|1|An engrossing romantic drama that tells a good story with fine performances and an overall honesty of dramatic purpose.
7932|0|Mild but absorbing drama about infidelity, passion and deception among some everyday middle-class types in Milan is short on insight but benefits from involving characters, an enveloping urban milieu and inevitable consequences.

63383|1|Exquisitely photographed in wide-screen black-and-white by Conrad Hall.
15273|1|The three leads are on outstanding form, while Jack Nitzsche's score shimmers with foreboding.
75408|0|The new film does little more than reintroduce these familiar characters (with new actors playing the children, who would otherwise be college age by now) and let them get on one another's nerves in earnest.
42792|0|An uneven, overly stylized mess that wants to recall Quentin Tarantino, but which only mines the glitz, not the depth or the sharpness of Tarantino's dialogue.
28168|1|Offbeat and worthwhile

8712|1|The best things in this transsexual comedy-melodrama are Lizzy Gardiner and Tim Chappel's colorful costumes, which deservedly won the Oscar, and Terrence Stamp's performance, snubbed by the Academy.
27733|1|The plot is nothing more than an excuse for the series of spectacular action sequences in which Chan shows both his physical skills and great sense of humour.
44969|1|The movie is magnificently photographed on location. The performances are authentic and understated, and Brandauer makes a convincing veteran prospector, part hard-bitten, part dreamer.

25012|1|The Turtles themselves are better-natured than ever, and even nicely mellowed.
24079|1|Liman can uncork leap-out-of-your-seat shocks, draw out suspense scenes with malicious finesse and even ease a touch of romance and droll humor into the yarn.
10638|0|Vanity is one thing, but Costner's act is beginning to feel like a particularly self-righteous -- and tiresome -- form of pathology. Someone should tell him that an actor's job is to disappear into his characters, not vice-versa.
30403|1|Recalling Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction - but edgier than both - this is a hell of a first film. For all its bonecrunching savagery, it's also a fundamentally moral work.

6866|1|Adam's Rib is a bright comedy success, belting over a succession of sophisticated laughs.
56246|1|Will adults enjoy this film? Some might be amused by the crazy situations and verbal and visual outrageousness--though they probably won't admit it.
18567|1|Watching Psycho today we are all, like Marion in the shower, vainly trying to recover lost innocence too late.
19335|1|It's a good date movie, and I recommend it. But don't forget to rent The Shop Around the Corner.

29622|0|As anticipated the climax is very abrupt and unresolved, but by then I just didn't care, and was so glad to see this junk come to an end.
32636|1|Doesn't quite fulfill its promise, in part because the title destination is too obviously a MacGuffin in which the film ultimately doesn't even feign mild interest.
43249|1|There's a wedding, a death and two love affairs in Saving Face, and they all come as a surprise
14158|1|The eight-minute sequence featuring a physical fight between Bancroft and Duke as the teacher attempts to teach the pupil some manners stands as one of the most electrifying and honest ever committed to film.

72710|1|Imperfect, but very lovable.
81552|0|A Southwestern American pastoral of dormant menace, The King is a film of triple-dipped mood that turns on an act of shocking violence, but still seems to substitute willful indistinctness for insight.
22267|0|The reality-TV-like camera work takes some getting used to. And the even shakier editing, dialogue and acting quickly reveal this isn't exactly summer's big blockbuster.
831|0|An unfortunate hybrid of Oedipal and Peter Pan complexes, Singleton's film is a mishmash of half-cocked ideas and unrealized sentiments.
2157|0|The latest installment of the life of Bridget Jones is tired and sloppy.

13681|1|This story of angels is really an examination of what it means to be human -- in the most profound sense but via the smallest, most trivial details.
51454|0|As an existential awakening into the light and triumph of rational thought over superstition, it's an engaging film, but as a murder mystery it plods along as though weighted down by the heavens and more.
69684|0|The producers in their infinite wisdom decided to release it five days before the single most anticipated science fiction epic of all time.
65843|0|Teeters on the edge of lightweight, bland fare more associated with what's on airline menus. But the cast adds flavor and energy to the otherwise unremarkable itinerary.
29588|1|This quiet community and family drama set on the North Carolina shore offers a bighearted outlook on how to absorb change and defeat.

18497|0|This harmless but charmless caper will have everybody except the most undemanding tot fidgeting.
3007|0|The film covers the main events of the Orton life in a manner that is nothing less than distracted. One has little understanding of the fatal intensity - and need - that kept Orton and Halliwell together.

40560|1|I know exactly nothing about skateboarding, but this wild, exuberant documentary puts it all in perspective, outlining a crew of 12 surfers-turned-skaters who pioneered the sport -- and, some say, the art form.

7300|0|Ultimately it's the wholly unbelievable -- and frankly, impossible -- story that makes Hope Springs fail to work in virtually every scene.
8577|0|This leisurely little import has its moments - but far too many of them. It runs two hours and seems to end five times.
5133|1|Just when it seems like 'The Eel' is going to settle into a standard love-conquers-fear tale, the writers begin coloring in the characters, revealing their secrets and insecurities. The results are sometimes shocking and sometimes funny...

17608|0|An arrogant former sportsman learns a lesson in humility in this predictable comedy.
14370|1|Middle-aged angst - and not the mystery of Reeves' unsolved death - lies at the heart of Hollywoodland.
12683|1|I've never been a big fan of technique that calls attention to itself, but Wong's frenetic blend of slow motion, pixilation, rushing backgrounds and frozen foregrounds (or vice versa) is as integral to this movie as its bubbly story and characters.
27845|1|Occasionally preachy and always predictable, it's nevertheless executed with efficiency and a little charm.
19496|0|A prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp.
42912|1|A quirky comedy set in Newfoundland that cleverly captures the dry wit that's so prevalent on The Rock.
6587|1|Both leads are outstanding. Langella is especially mesmerizing as the calculating grand manipulator. It's not an impression of the former president, but a piece of his essence.

14145|1|Roos does better at imparting a sense of the striving that's inherent to L.A., letting us know, through the characters' living situations, that not everyone shares in the town's magic.
41903|1|With a few extra zeros on the budget this time around, Sommers runs riot.
24453|1|It's sometimes so explicit, corny and odd that you can understand why a studio had second thoughts about it. But it also now has the feel of a true epic.

39936|0|While the subject is well handled and enacted in a series of outstanding characterizations, it seems dated and makes for grim screen fare.
18513|1|It would all be too obviously feel-good if Ducastel and Martineau weren't also tuned in to the liberating drift of the open highway and a sharp native humor that adds needed flesh and blood to their walking metaphors.

78352|1|A nice portrayal by Ashlee of a wanna-be rocker, in a music story in L.A. without drugs!
29044|1|This film is quiet in an eerie, slow burn, dripping with noir sort of way; disarmingly reserved, it manages to burrow under your skin and leave a lingering impression.
77819|0|"Charlie Kaufman possibly could have uncovered this story's true smugness. Instead, Jack Black and Ben Stiller exaggerate what works about their styles to the point of annoyance in a can't-miss misfire akin to John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd's ""Neighbors."""

14700|1|There are those wonderful performances by the lead players - and especially Channing, who has been underused or misused most of her film career - and they make it fairly enjoyable entertainment.

73993|0|"The trash heap of ""There's Something About Mary"" ripoffs grows a little higher."
26119|1|Under Sidney Franklin's watchful supervision and William Wyler's masterly direction the story has become the most stirring, heart-clutching picture of our times.
5673|1|A smart comedy melding cold-war paranoia and pre-feminism gender roles that only intermittently succeeds is far more welcome than yet another big, loud, juvenile attempt to make us laugh.

25458|1|Let Kolya work its magic upon your heart.
69732|1|When Farrell's on screen, Daredevil becomes more than just a finely tuned entertainment machine. In a movie that will rake people in no matter what, it's fun to see something unexpected.
5815|1|With virtually no music and very little expository dialogue, this is one of the rare films with enough faith in moviegoers to let them figure things out for themselves.
36089|1|It's as gentle and warm a film as [John Ford] ever made and it follows a classic Ford theme: the creation of a community in the west...
57937|1|...a fairly effective little thriller that's backed by a blistering pace and a trio of expectedly strong performances.
10961|0|If you are looking for mindless action, it's not bad. But since this is trying to be something more than that, I can't quite recommend it.

31319|1|Among other things, Mr. Herzog visually dazzles us while he's pulling the rug from under our feet.

63095|1|Mr. Noyce interweaves the political and romantic plots masterfully.
8755|1|Forget haunted houses and the mountains of the moon: There's no better environment to show off the wonder of the immersive IMAX 3-D experience than the deep blue sea.

38544|1|Surpise, surprise! This college comedy is better than you'd expect.

12275|1|The Enterprise's first feature, with smarts outdoing guns.
75699|0|...pretty much your standard teenage-Romanian-werewolf movie...
14327|1|Snipes and Harrelson make a winning team, even if their partnership doesn't quite stand up to comparison with Eastwood and Wallach in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, or Redford and Newman in The Sting.
35841|1|Looks even starker and more jarringly isolated today than it did in 1961.
70946|1|It's a lot of fun.
31271|1|Grows on you, largely because of the charm of its youngest cast member, Scarlett Johansson.

16056|0|Farley might want to be like John Candy, but, while Candy knew how to make an audience laugh, Farley keeps missing the mark.
49271|1|An outstanding gallery of connivers
15468|1|Although the slowish pacing early on over-indicates how both magicians' marquee misdirection (a disappearing act) will be achieved, The Prestige still manages a neat trick of its own.
17899|1|While it's fair to call The Usual Suspects a gimmick in search of a movie, one could say something similar of, say, an Agatha Christie mystery. [Blu-ray]
3001|1|Fabulous immigrant-family saga to see with teens.
1062|1|Every scene drives home its point, plainly, that man's inhumanity to man is incurable.
31884|1|The production is a most realistic, hard-hitting and perceptive look at the seamy side of pro football.

74408|1|Jokes, puppies and that scary Cruella -- there's plenty for children to like.

62161|1|Smartly edited with terrific location work in New York City. The dependable Kotto is a standout.
3751|0|Who knows whether Dan Brown was motivated by a distaste for Catholicism or merely by money? Regardless, it seems dishonest for him to foist his debunked heresies on the gullible, unsuspecting public as if they're the God's honest truth.
47153|0|A mildly pleasant film with two charming leads.
33697|0|Adrenalin: Fear the Movie
24301|0|Farrell is the best thing about the film, which veers into oversentimentality quite a bit for a film that's shot with such a gritty aesthetic.
20056|1|...a perfectly watchable (yet far-from-memorable) romantic comedy/coming-of-age story.
26453|1|The Wedding Banquet never becomes bogged down by its own seriousness. Lee manages to keep the production buoyant by including scenes that are often riotously funny.
79781|1|"Along with his later 8 1/2, La Dolce Vita is regarded as one of acclaimed Italian director Federico Fellini's best-loved and most influential films. The '60s-set tale of one man's struggle with the so-called ""sweet life"" stars Marcello Mastroi"

6974|0|Perfectly dreadful in every respect, this big-budget remake of the late H.B. Halicki's 1974 indie hit may well rep the nadir of the Bruckheimer (and Simpson) franchise, and doesn't even rate on the most basic level as a good car-chase picture.
8606|0|This feelgood romantic comedy is short on laughs, sexual chemistry, and the thriller subplot won't produce any white knuckles.
70897|0|Wit is drowned out by caricature, and the antics become laboriously over-the-top.
46361|0|Somehow all the glibness never translates to funny.
77359|1|It's a sweet, lyrically funny, multi- layered work that again demonstrates that Woody Allen is our premier film maker who, standing something over 5 feet tall in his sneakers, towers above all others.
72722|0|While le Carre's narrative returns an unequivocal guilty verdict on the drug companies, the jury on Meirelles's storytelling abilities remains hung.

34892|1|A fine, honest tale that gives full respect to the pain of yearning and the power of hope.
1894|1|[The film impresses] with its painterly and dramatic lighting, beautiful dissolves and tracking shots, sophisticated effects, and unexpected eccentricities.
79623|0|An Arabian Nightish saga told with some briskness and opulence for the childish eye, yet ultimately falling short of implied promise as an adventure spree.
1206|1|A symphony of sound, animation and unbridled Disney spirit.
57243|0|Pretty awful in its un-MST3Ked incarnation.

13834|1|An entertaining fluffy popcorn comedy with plenty of eye candy for the guys and gals.
71275|1|Road Trip ... celebrates the triumph of hedonistic righteousness in a world where it already rules.
46293|1|Even if it is, as he claims, his last film, Saraband will be a testament to Bergman's skill as a filmmaker, still a creative force to be reckoned with after 60-plus years in the business.
