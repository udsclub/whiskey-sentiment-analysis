98924|0|This film is headed quickly for DVD. In the video store, though, it isn't funny enough to be shelved in the comedy section nor dirty enough to be filed with the smut.
27848|0|Watching Inspector Gadget is like watching a human Swiss Army knife for nearly an hour and a half.
28866|0|Houston, we have a problem. It's called The Astronaut's Wife.
15178|1|What a biography. And what a screenplay.
87782|0|Rutinaria adaptación de un best-seller sobre temática exótica, con lujos de fotografía, vestuario, dirección de arte y hasta música que no disimulan un argumento cursi y previsible.
73078|0|The acting is facial-expressions- visible-from- 100-feet overdone and the choppy editing makes for awkward storytelling. However, the battle scenes, which make up at least half the movie, are killer.
32172|1|Brilliant.
33377|0|Lawrence Kasdan, it seems, mulled over the first draft of his screenplay twenty years ago; it should have been left to languish in development purgatory.
69623|1|For those who enjoy a ripper of a good yarn, Paycheck is good value.
13897|0|Blood and Wine is a murky attempt at film noir that has a couple of good twists, but overall it wastes its talent.
48422|0|Features inexplicable actions, dubious coincidences, and characters you'd happily murder yourself given half a chance.
4423|0|Mugging to an unfunny script, Keaton and Davis are no Tracy and Hepburn, and the funereal pace doesn't help.
69054|0|A disappointing failure of tone, a lush and overblown self-indulgence in which David Lean has given us a great deal less than meets the eye.
94709|0|Shrek the Third has the curse of the third in a bankable series. It is too often sappy, tiresome, and overblown. A franchise such as Shrek, with all the money it has accumulated, should be able to buy a little freshness and originality. But instead
8310|1|Enjoyable in a playful way
84847|1|A celebratory experience, paying homage to those who, out of a lack of anything better to do,...created an outright phenomenon.
19044|0|"As drama it gets a little too soapy and the jumps in time can seem abrupt, but ""Cavalcade"" really does convey a sense of history and historical periods."
7667|0|Andrew Bergman's direction makes it watchable, but his screenplay pulls its punches on the sleaze, and tear-jerking sentimentality and inadequate humour don't combine well with the drama.
27039|0|The special effects are decidedly on the cheap side.
51295|0|What puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in Britney Spears' first movie.
4255|1|An ingenious, cathartic exercise in illusion and fear.
74682|0|It's probably best to think of the film as an extended music video, a watershed moment for movie sound tracks, and not much more.
28379|1|A showcase for wit.
7054|0|For a while, the cast is appealing enough, and the design is House Beautiful enough, to camouflage the Fatal flaws that turn the second half into an overblown, predictable snicker-fest.
58642|1|A wild ride that effortlessly combines devilish dark humor, slapstick comedy, extreme violence and bitter satire.
100197|0|ABBA's legacy will stand the test of time far longer than this
3658|0|Generous souls may try to blame this travesty of the Deadline comic-strip on the studio execs who forced director Talalay to tone down and re-edit her cut.
61713|1|Fortunately for Wilco, who have a passion for excellence, creative freedom, and innovation, Jones's camera recorded footage at the scene of a crime against art.
78434|0|What were they thinking?
102548|1|The best movie I've seen about teen angst since Donnie Darko comes from Belgium?
94863|1|As observers we can project our own fantasies onto Ben's, and [director] Ellis enhances this dreamy effect with low-budget ingenuity, like cleverly executing location changes in the same unbroken shot.
97269|1|The monsters are routine CGI creations, crudely animated and unconvincing. In a film of such visual majesty and surprisingly weighty drama, they present an unfortunate and needless distraction.
4254|0|Poor execution of a great concept. Why doesn't Englund ever meet Freddy? Why aren't there more movie refernces? Has Langencamp'
32938|0|This film is stale.
102249|1|You do feel that, with it's knowing one-liners and classic movie references, Igor is trying terribly hard to amuse an adult audience, possibly at the expense of children it should be entertaining.
8274|0|Works best as religious satire, but never quite takes off as a mystery or a tale involving bloodsuckers.
94516|0|Below average, overlong drama that fails to deliver an emotional punch, largely because it's unsure of whether it wants to be a father-son drama or a romcom.
68778|0|A cutesy boy meets girl romantic comedy flatly directed by Delbert Mann.
20825|1|An inspired update of the Faust legend featuring a tour de force performance by Klaus Maria Brandauer.
9721|0|Villains curl their upper lip and snarl in bad Russian accents, while Van Damme bungles four-word sentences.
67899|0|The acting is terrible,with Connery, at his lowest common denominator, stealing the show.
97587|0|Some laughs, but you expect more from Apatow.
2975|1|In Connery it has a hero who is inescapably appealing.
76953|0|Saddled with the sort of dialogue that would fell a von Trapp.
46984|1|Jane Camion's stunning feature debut is a bold and audacious dark comedy about sexual politics and dysfunctional family relations.
61560|0|It's like watching Univision or Telemundo on the big screen.
70303|1|Cybulski, called the Polish James Dean, gives a broodingly intense performance.
18943|1|When the Torah is explained in mathematical terms, it's enough to make you want to take up second year trig - like the movie, a deeply flawed idea.
12738|1|It is a stirring drama of World War II, in which Spiegel has had the excellent help of British director David Lean, in charge of the action, and of a fine company of international players.
37692|0|Trixie is the kind of movie that makes you want to quit your job and become an irate stalker making some famous person very sorry for their sins.
102364|0|Not a cinematic powerhouse, but a good conversation starter
32416|1|Like its predecessor, Fantasia 2000 offers a plotless string of beautifully animated vignettes set to music; unlike its predecessor, it's a good deal shorter and far less tedious for it.
93621|1|Sure it might be barely plotless fluff, but it's well executed barely plotless fluff, and doesn't try to pretend to be anything else.
102530|1|The Power of Song shows this icon of 20th-century music to be a man of passion and principle, and a true American. An important figure, an important film.
57853|1|Chabrol's ostensibly placid version of Madame Bovary invests Flaubert's portrait of stifled womanhood with unmistakable flintiness. It chafes against the beautiful images with perfect irony.
31169|1|Trading Places is a light romp geared up by the schtick shifted by Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy.
44535|0|Suggests a sudsy version of The King and I without forceful personalities or fancy production numbers.
21682|0|A decent way to settle the little ones down on a Saturday afternoon, sure, but so is Ritalin.
72190|1|it's all very silly and highly unbelievable, but the five main leads are all having a good time.
44948|1|Tran Anh Hung, who earned an Oscar nomination for his first movie, The Scent of Green Papaya (1993), has created another exquisite portrait of Vietnamese family life.
6853|1|The film is full of gratifying gags like these, but it also has to strain for newly enlarged scope.
20635|0|"It strictly remains more ""trick"" than ""treat."""
89547|0|You have to wonder why they even bothered with the subtitles. It's not like they make much difference.
58902|0|A minor cult film.
2319|1|Does this film know it's funny? Does it think it's scary? In truth, it's enough of both to enjoy.
43524|1|It's one of the strange ironies of Hollywood that adult audiences are usually treated like imbeciles while children receive much greater respect.
33120|0|Where the Buffalo Roam is a shambling stiff, destined to tarnish the reputations of everyone responsible for it.
41545|1|An audacious movie about skid-row existentialism.
37724|0|every time it starts engaging the viewer, it quickly shifts gears and heads into a new decade
101899|1|What Role Models does well is extract every last loose-moral laugh it can from its who-is-educating-who? scenario.
74540|0|The general value of this film is far bellow the standards expected from someone like Fritz Lang.
10719|0|The format of interweaving what little storytelling there is along with stand-up routines is an unfulfilling one.
52238|0|...The latest proof that trying to adapt a film from a video game is a bad idea.
54455|1|The top-billed actors deliver: Hanks with his resonant reserve and Newman in conveying Rooney's failed attempt to live up to his self-image as the ultimate just and loving patriarch. [Blu-ray]
24384|1|Eastwood in fine form.
90842|1|Clichéd dance movie with some fun moves.
91505|1|... an illusion of grand production values and produced and released... with a mix of high culture and popular showmanship.
52263|0|A stronger actress, say Michelle Pfeiffer or Cate Blanchette, would have given this political melodrama more credibility and power, but Andie MacDowell is poorly cast and she seems lost.
41360|1|[Allows] Fincher to shine as the skilled, stylish director that he is.
32624|0|One measure of its desperation and lack of respect for its audience is the frequency with which it labors to wring humor from flatulence and excrement gags.
101486|0|mono pragma poy se boithaei na pernas tin ora soy, to na metras poses gkrimatses prolabainei na kanei o anyparktos Colin Firth, hlapakiazontas kanapedakia
48382|0|Whilst interesting, Nichols' film follows too many paths to ever be truly satisfying.
90354|0|The script, which was co-written by director Billy Kent, has the forced 'raciness' of a mid-'70s dinner-theater sex comedy.
94078|0|Ice Cube's do-it-yourself sequel is too formulaic.
91257|1|Like Ben from Bennifer, George Reeves aspired to be a Great Actor, but was weighed down by audience expectations. Affleck does a terrific job with this role.
84329|1|Amy Adams and Emily Blunt, two fine actresses, get the opportunity to glow in strong lead roles as complex, emotionally fractured females who work hard to earn your respect -- and reclaim their own.
68239|1|Despite the flaws, Evans's thoughtful script and the unclichTd performances of Wood and Mazzello exert a powerful grip. The film stays with you.
70597|1|At its heart lies a sweet romance, with good performances from both the leads and an Oscar nomination for supporting actress Lahti.
51465|1|Beyond its contagious, wacky humour, the film has a very sweet heart
82638|1|The bank robbery action, the nose-thumbing at authority, and the rise of an anti-hero -- a colorful action yarn.
79198|1|Dated, but still moving '40s classic with Garson and Colman.
77520|1|A jazzy, offhandedly brilliant exercise in colorful mendacity and shell game shenanigans that benefits from the cool, authoritative occupational swagger of John C. Reilly.
58880|1|An evenly paced, gently acted and subdued black comedy with a subversive moral at its heart.
91266|1|Worthwhile for the amusement of the escape to a bygone era alone. But when you factor in an absorbing pulp fiction plotline, you've got all you can ask of a cinematic experience.
91740|0|This is one of those religious epics that looks like a religious epic, which is fine as far as it goes, but misses the mark because it doesn't manage to translate the feel of the original to the screen.
29226|1|Hugely enjoyable and very clever portrait of Harvey Pekar.
50974|0|...a sensational self-expose, in which the director presents us with any number of characters that ... reflect and represent various aspects of Todd Solondz
101487|0|"Words almost fail me after watching this terrible romantic comedy from Griffin Dunne which is perilously described as a ""sort of Carole Lombard screwball comedy"". Would that it were."
70401|1|This harrowing, white-knuckle tale of human endurance and gut-wrenching dilemma mingles the dramatization of these events and interviews with both climbers into an unforgettable, sometimes comically deadpan nightmare.
32480|0|Shepard's material has worked its way into categorically better films, and the talents of the creative, ex-Police musician Stewart Copeland go largely untapped.
63559|0|Sadly, what began as a smart sci-fi franchise has apparently been huffing glue since 1985.
3205|0|It's pointless to blame the cast members, who at least are in there trying.
1404|0|A witless, sexist, offensive mishmash that is surprisingly inept, considering all the high-power talent involved.
83919|0|What were the filmmakers thinking? I mean, what besides making a second trip to the barn to milk the $300 million cash cow that was Miss Congeniality?
30729|0|Unbelievably boring.
64934|1|Talk about a movie that earns its tears.
2488|1|Creates a scenario that it's inevitable the heavy rains will fall over the bloody land ... .
101591|1|All in all it's a modern-day, Kevin Smith fairytale: a big-screen bearing, perhaps, of his soul at its sincerest and wittiest, if not filthiest.
79050|0|What makes this one worth a peek is that the role of a pasty-faced zombie-vampire is played by no less than Humphrey Bogart!
5982|1|For all the dynamism and drive, the film walks a fine line between exposure and outright exploitation -- wherein lies much of its appeal.
40937|0|This could have been a compelling movie about a wonderful writer, but instead it's a tedious, pointless mess. After spending over 2 hours with Arenas, I still knew nothing about him. Javier Bardem's great performance seemed to be a complete waste.
58201|0|Interesting, but not compelling.
9396|1|Fred and Ginger's best.
98359|1|Brimming with exploitation antics, grindhouse sensibilities and, heh heh, exploding bunnies, Doomsday conjures a future thrown back to the dead-end styles and amoral excesses of the eighties - and no future could be bleaker than that.
30319|0|I'm all for family-friendly entertainment with a minimum of sex, violence, and foul language -- that is, when done right.
2513|1|Young teens will like brash, immature humor.
56457|0|...the film itself kind of lags behind on the same dirt trails over and over again, looking around at all the pretty sights without actually going towards them to investigate.
1645|0|All this star power goes for naught in Traeger's film, which tries to blend bucolic sweetness with juvenile let's-make-a-porno jokes.
86188|0|A 'Mad About Gramps' episode that requires Falk to line-dance to Travis Tritt and otherwise demonstrate that old people sure are funny and cute and flatulent.
81820|1|"Jim Caviezel, hot off his success in ""The Passion of the Christ!"""
24247|0|Every year the DVD will [be] displayed as though it's worthy of renting. But it's out because it takes place around the holidays, not because it belongs to be there.
32520|1|Easy Rider, is not only emblematic of independent American cinema, but, released in 1969, is the definitive statement on the death of the 60s.
80621|0|The title says it all...and is the only reason to see this misfire.
93935|1|The plot plays out as predictably as anyone might expect, but the fine details keep Pride squarely above average.
101378|0|You could have filmed zombies in a gorgeous 19th century beach house and gotten the same emotional impact.
16462|1|"Largely sweet and insubstantial, not so much ""funny"" as it is charming and grin-making."
309|1|A guilty pleasure.
81744|0|As a character drama about dealing with violence and loss, The Interpreter is a quiet success. Unfortunately, it's a thriller, and all of the qualities that make it a successful character study rob it of the tension a thriller needs to succeed.
97204|0|The second half finds the audience inhaling the fumes of a rocket with more fizz than fury.
68891|1|The madcap Marxes, in one of their maddest screen frolics.
23836|1|pure joy--whimsical, funny, and downright entertaining
38005|1|More serious than you'd expect.
40093|1|It lives on, haunting and creepy, an embodiment of the guilty soul of film noir. No one who has seen it has easily forgotten it.
91949|1|Here, the feelings run very deep, and dark as dried blood, with Clint aware that some things don't need to be said and others shouldn't be shown.
37071|0|Roger Moore is a pastry chef's idea of James Bond; but Christopher Lee as the archetype of the evil antagonist makes this 007 outing just about bearable.
44498|1|It's a movie with a lot on its mind - while never toppling over under the weight of its good intentions.
83018|1|That IMAX 3-D cameras have plunged so deep to record an often bizarre array of sea creatures undoubtedly delivers a certain 'wow' factor, but the accompanying commentary is heavier on breathless excitement than solid fact.
78615|0|Big, grand, messy. If you enjoy a nice slice of Hollywood miscalculation every now and then--and who doesn't--you might have a good time.
1942|0|So concerned with bigness that it forgets to thrill.
53857|1|Chick flick for mom; teens may not enjoy it.
89333|0|Just when the baseball slapstick starts wearing thin, a final-reel gush of truly cynical sentiment on behalf of the physically challenged sends the ordeal-factor off the scale.
64593|0|Captures the brash boldness of the novel, but not the literary wit. A misguided affair.
53143|0|Angelina Jolie's romance/comedy/drama isn't terribly romantic, comedic or dramatic.
24373|1|Eastwood's mythic Western divided film critics: Some were baffled by the audacity of his playing a religious figure, while others claimed he was just embodying the mysterious knight-stranger, a common character in classic Westerns.
71606|1|A brightly amusing romp, which can truly be recommended for the entire family in that time-honored (but somewhat neglected these days) Disney tradition.
96373|1|Being faintly disappointed by a new Wes Anderson film -- films whose primary form of emotional address, after all, is faint disappointment -- remains one of the few consistent pleasures of American moviegoing.
22477|1|One of the smartest, most nail-biting thrillers in EON's
60048|0|It's hard to believe that this drivel was based on a book... but Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson make it somewhat tolerable at least.
17252|1|Titanic provides an absorbing blend of historical fact and old-fashioned Hollywood tearjerking.
29090|0|Envelhecendo terrivelmente mal, torna-se risível em função da trilha sonora nada apropriada, das péssimas atuações das protagonistas e do roteiro que desperdiça a boa premissa.
32101|1|A loopy contemporary comedy more reminiscent of [Jane Campion's] earlier film Sweetie.
384|0|When the slicing and dicing and blood-spurting become as unstoppably frenzied as they do in the course of Ninja Assassin, one's instinct is less to take fright than take 40 winks and hope to wake up when it's all over.
94444|0|Never satisfying no matter what genre it attempts.
77048|0|While striving for a bit of liberalism (ain't we City types the real stoopid ones) almost every scene then throws in the towel and falls back on a clutch of unfunny country-livin' clichés.
71843|0|Giant animal silliness.
27190|0|While It Came from Outer Space's theme is a refreshing change of pace from the doomsaying brethren of its era, its appearance is not.
16877|1|...boasts a tongue-in-cheek, downright campy sensibility that ultimately pervades every aspect of the proceedings.
12290|1|It may seem too spare, too clinical, its moments of war even too familiar for some. But, aiming for minds as well as hearts, Kubrick hits his target squarely.
59902|0|Fassbinder's work here is muddy at best. His black and white cinematography limits his typically washed-out color palette while failing to connect us emotionally with the bygone era.
66535|1|...Cagney's picture through and through. He imbues every scene with the kind of electricity only a handful of screen stars have ever managed.
24101|1|Superior sci-fi horror.
21313|1|Not a whole lot happens, but horror fans will appreciate the atmosphere.
4187|1|The period's feathery drawing style abounds, and an all-round warmth pervades.
60575|0|At some point during Bringing Down the House, I covered my face ... I haven't had that kind of reaction to a movie in a while.
43796|0|By the time O'Neal gets around to intoning the famous tag line, you'll be so sick of hearing Francis Lai's love theme that you'll want to strangle the projectionist.
19410|1|Grounded in a gritty reality - and shot as such - it's still an action classic today that offers adrenaline-fueled pacing without insulting one's intelligence.
35855|0|Unique atmosphere, solid performances and profound discussions about the nature of our violent, technology-obsessed society don't add up to enough by the end of the movie.
61635|1|Jacques Perrin's spectacular documentary takes observation a step further as he literally seems to take flight with flocks of birds as they make their annual migration.
92004|0|"The third ""Saw"" in the franchise loses its edge."
57310|1|Demme's film looks very French, and appears as appetizing as a croissant.
21894|1|funny and completely twisted
71365|0|Plays like a two-part episode of Clifford's really small TV show.
8069|0|The makers of this sluggish, by-the-numbers action pic couldn't even be bothered to exploit the obvious angles.
55712|1|Alec Guinness received a well deserved Oscar nomination for this hilarious British comedy
52930|0|The premise is admittedly pretty crafty, but other than that two-minute distraction, Return to Horror High is certainly no great shake.
43909|1|Doesn't matter if you have no interest in the Internet, high finance or business in general. Startup.com works in purely human terms.
78887|1|Jennifer Jones offers a virtual reprise of her sultry performance in Duel in the Sun as the titular heroine of Ruby Gentry.
21398|1|[It] may be one of the most romantic and perverse ghost stories ever filmed, set not in a haunted castle but in a haunted city...
92741|0|It's a delectable premise, rendered with smooth efficiency but we never really get beneath the surface of this shallow parallel reality.
68210|0|quite good
89844|1|The Notorious Bettie Page may be nothing but a series of beautiful poses, but audiences will be more than happy with the result.
94663|1|Isn't the same thinking man's zombie film as its predecessor, but it ramps up the action and will leave you on edge enough that you'll be searching for a nightlight before going to sleep.
51408|1|By film's end one feels as if they have indeed taken a long trip with these people -- and along the way has grown to know and care about them.
68211|1|None of the other recent apocalypse movies has shown so much political or cinematic sophistication.
54244|0|Peter Gallagher must've been hard up for cash.
63462|1|It's an exercise in urban paranoia and mental disintegration that echoes or anticipates everything from Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby to Bitter Moon and The Pianist.
48806|0|This one is for the Wayne completist who must see all of his 142 films.
95962|1|There are plenty of surprises in this amusing Donnie Darko-ish metaphysical thriller, but watching Van Wilder and Blade: Trinity star Ryan Reynolds flex some previously hidden acting chops is the main one.
9434|1|Old-fashioned life-of-a-family pic that's like nothing you'll see today -- and I mean that in the best way possible.
88918|1|Enjoyably quirky thriller with bizarre, off-the-wall performances from its entire cast and some striking location work.
14594|1|At a time when songs showcased in movies were being shot as MTV music videos, leave it to director Alan Parker (The Commitments, Fame) to offer a full-blooded musical with epic elegance on its mind.
22696|0|Madonna has made a career out of toying with image and ego, but this is a vanity project in the smallest sense possible.
55067|1|Beau Pere conveys the ways in which some men prove to be pawns in the chess game of love.
97810|0|The dance scenes are fun to watch but the script's not too light on its feet.
34140|0|Ghost Dog himself is so remote and focused on his path, it's hard to drum up a lot of identification or sympathy.
101925|1|Niccol is no stranger to hot-button issues, but he outdoes his previous efforts by injecting this satire of war profiteering in the Halliburton age with a wicked arsenic wit.
76995|0|The title alone betrays an entire Hollywood mindset of rehash, reheat, recombine. Re-please.
73088|0|Plucked from its cultural context, Bang Rajan is being offered to American audiences as another example of Asian extreme action movies, and gore hounds will find it gratifyingly full of spurting blood and flying limbs.
24018|1|Fast-paced and witty, this is Chase's best solo venture to date, and will hold almost anyone's attention for its well-edited 98 minutes.
32190|0|The acting is acceptable but is as extravagant as the script, and Boorman's direction is repetitive and ponderous, beating that single antiwar theme to death long before the adversaries do.
28181|1|As an alcoholic ex-actress, Jane Fonda gives a brilliant, Oscar-nominated peformance in Lumet's routine thriller set (for a change) in L.A.
83096|0|Orky is very concerned with the environment and can repair relationships between parents and children. But Orky cannot save this movie.
14128|1|"""To boldly go"" never went quite so boldly as it did here."
36955|1|Simultaneously ethical and unethical, the snappily dressed Verdoux exists as an extraordinary challenge to capitalism's status quo during its seismic swing toward fascism.
2528|1|Idiotic, amateurish - and really, really funny.
29134|0|Lawrence has become involved in a film that makes us acutely embarrassed for him.
58337|1|For two-thirds of its running time the film is close to genius. But there's still no third act.
38886|1|The mystery keeps the viewer riveted to the screen.
69436|1|a fun flick
37707|0|The film has less to do with politics, women's or otherwise, than with a very conventional notion of the redemptive power of mother love. Which would be all right if director Hal Ashby had managed to mount it effectively.
35632|1|Winning, sweet-natured '80s romcom has profanity.
42933|1|Perhaps the biggest surprise is Liotta, who turns in a hilarious turn as Dean, in a blatant send-up of his mobster screen persona.
3913|1|It's often very funny, looks great and is played to perfection.
19987|1|An inevitable sequel that's not as good as its progenitor, but better than most movies with the numbers 2 through 8 in their titles.
83335|0|Nino acts like an Italian fairy-god-uncle... transforming this house into a home - where flowers thrive, violin music fills the air, and everybody eats dinner together.
86464|0|Mirrormask eventually establishes itself as an thoroughly interminable piece of work that substitutes endless creativity for context and character development...
52072|0|This beautiful but notoriously disappointing film is one of the most overblown epic Westerns of any decade.
498|1|Much to my surprise, I found Babe charming in an eccentric, oddly tough-minded sort of way. And if it isn't quite good enough to change my mind about the entire critter-chat genre, it is certainly good enough to recommend.
78529|1|The outrageous character Renee Zellweger has crafted is so dynamic and funny she's able to hold the sequel together.
1189|1|Even as you laugh at these guys, you feel an overwhelming sympathy for them. Sensing that they love each other, you want their dumb, dysfunctional lives to work out.
11047|1|E.T. remains Spielberg's finest demonstration of his ability to merge the feelings of suburban dissatisfaction - alienation, if you will - that permeates a lot of his work, with a unique sense of childhood wonder and imagination
61200|1|Charming and disarming...
39518|0|It's a tortuously rambling attempt at a slasher pic, throwing random scenes at us without purpose, reason or consequence.
84997|0|Another month, another anodyne tween-com from Hilary Duff.
50121|1|The story is slow in parts but as this is a Nickelodeon film, it is filled with all sorts of fun moments that children are sure to love.
59596|1|Standard, low-budget slasher film, elevated by a breakthrough performance by Angela Bettis.
4370|1|Serviceable family entertainment.
14287|0|It's harmless but unsurprising.

88653|0|Grating and wildly unpleasant from beginning to end, London is perhaps one of the least entertaining films that I can recall seeing.
27141|1|"Like the hugely successful B-Movie that inspired it, Harry Novak's 1965 sexploitation classic ""Kiss Me Quick!"" ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" is an exploitation film that draws on a grab-bag of social identifiers to expand on conventional hypocrisies..."

96148|1|Particularly for Radcliffe fans, it's an agreeable journey.
100822|0|I cannot accept that this is a Star Wars movie.
51112|1|The director's peppery edge and humour lift this above the normal drive-in fare and Steele adds punch.
80174|1|Albeit scattershot, Phantom does cohere as a satire of keeping up appearances in which everything is as it appears.
74479|1|Like all Zinnemann's work, this meticulously crafted political thriller is involving but not exciting due to his detached perspective and the fact that we know the outcome, that De Gaulle wasn't assassinated, but it's cast with Europe's best actors.
5735|1|A watchable futuristic prison flick. Decent B-movie thrills.
92382|1|This French comedy fondly lampoons both the popular French spy movies adapted from Jean Bruce's novels in the 1950s and '60s and the colonialist era they were set in.
48115|0|a caution against an entire American culture grown fat, brutal, and stupid on their own frugal repast of bread and circus
6412|0|Big and impressive in its epic scope, Germinal nevertheless suffers from uneven acting, over-the-top histrionics and a constant dark and dour tone.
67522|1|The occasion is death, but the movie is a joyous celebration of life.
66025|1|Morris. Hawking. Two of my favorite artists together. It couldn't miss, and it didn't.
34447|1|There is perhaps some discrepancy in the play between Wayne's heroic image and the pathological outsider he plays here (forever excluded from home, as the doorway shots at beginning and end suggest), but it hardly matters, given the film's visual splendou
40861|1|It may not be Dickens, but it's vintage Disney.
84404|0|While his script is good, even poetic at times, it certainly cannot be called an outstanding effort.
9816|1|Funny, pathetic, sad, absurdist -- writer-director John Herzfeld plays it any number of ways, and makes them all work.

65751|0|Schmaltzed up, dumbed down, bombastically-scored family drama of touchy-feely life lessons.

72279|0|..excels in period atmosphere and photography...But there's also a lack of drive and urgency in Techine's direction, which become most obvious in the muffled ending.
99243|0|Fact, fiction and chronology are juggled and blurred with such abandon that piecing it all together is bound to be a fruitless and frustrating effort.

45786|1|Quintessential Greenaway.
4211|0|This is more often self-portrait than portrait; like Hitler in Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will, she's presented as a fully formed deity without family background or ideology save a reverence for beauty and strength.

4064|1|Most biopics mistakenly try to take us from cradle to grave and end up skimming the surface. The wisdom of Cobb is that writer-director Ron Shelton knows that the close study of a single day can decode a human life.

89234|0|Poor Joe Pantoliano, Kid Rock, and Joanna Cassidy get mixed up in the flatulence.
100892|1|Folman's use of animation permits an audience to engage with the events, such as they are recalled, in a way that the simple testimony of those involved could not achieve.
57575|0|Even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency.
73517|1|On the whole his imagery is forceful.
13988|1|A masterpiece of Southern storytelling.
18336|1|It provides some generous insights into his psychic background when his unsupportive parents greet him back in New York at the end.
39478|1|Better than most superhero flicks to come down the pike. I assure you, this will achieve underground cult status one day.
24463|1|All very tongue-in-cheek (typified by the opening sequence, lifted straight from one of Joan's pulp novels) and great fun.
26538|1|Funny. SLC Punk! got to me.
92568|0|Pretentious twaddle that tells you nothing about Arbus. Robert Downey Jr. manages to be dignified even when covered in mountains of body hair. That's something.
80723|1|A hugely impressive piece of work for a young director previously known for his documentary U2 Rattle and Hum.
28487|1|If you die having seen only one Vincent Price movie, you could do worse than to have it be Masque.... Corman's most opulent and visually impressive Poe picture, and his grimmest.

96378|1|An intriguing blend of mainstream audience-pleaser and a more subtle, even intellectual agenda.
51387|0|A second-rate thriller with first-rate production values.
72460|1|The dour subject matter and director Mike Nichols' unflinching approach may make this a difficult viewing, but it is rewarding.
100937|0|Predictable and uninspiring.
56429|0|The opening moments culminate with a drunken date rape during which the rapist vomits on the back of his victim. It doesn't really improve from there.
55635|1|Above average kids movie. The girl is smart and the monkey is clever. Harvey Keitel's villain is a big surprise.
40471|0|It's assembly-line art, colorful and professionally crafted... more imagination will probably go into the marketing of the movie than went into the making of it.
2933|0|The leading performances, if acceptable, are not everything they needed to be to fully flesh out these elegant immortals.
85545|1|Just kind of a mildly entertaining footnote.
19480|1|The film is not just about the race between Abrahams, the Jewish law student (Ben Cross), and Scottish missionary Eric Liddell (the late Ian Charleson). It's a character study and a social history too.
38298|1|Actor Clive Owen proves to be powerfully unflappable -- a working-stiff James Bond, whose understated intensity draws you into the movie and refuses to let you leave.
40956|1|Schnabel can take on an apparently spent genre like the biopic and produce a pair of films that ooze vitality as they give their subjects a much needed celebration.
88057|0|Comedy can be a deadly weapon in the wrong hands.
39209|1|Both fascinating and entertaining-like Jack Elliott himself.
70411|1|The facts drop away, and it becomes impossible not to read the movie symbolically -- as a journey to the center of the earth, or farther still.
30903|1|One of the rare horror anthologies with a sharp sense of storytelling and an intrinsic ability for irony and metaphor...
5437|0|Fallon's obsessive quest to eliminate witnesses comes to seem more and more like utter madness -- but then, maybe that's the point. It's hard to tell amidst the layered gunfire and random explosions.
19770|0|...the casting director continued to find young performers who were wonderfully cute people and woefully bad actors.
25492|1|An intermittently engaging crime thriller that fuses elements of '30s era film noir with '70s era exploitation.
9509|1|This purely satirical version sometimes works, and sometimes doesn't.
11431|1|Private Benjamin is a comic fairy tale with a delightful performance by Goldie Hawn.
84081|0|Has too much plot and not enough music or comedy.
81160|1|Malkovich's elegantly malicious performance gives Ripley's Game a magnetic center.
20116|1|A wildly original roller-coaster ride of hilarious mischief.
64761|0|This time Mr. Burns is trying something in the Martin Scorsese street-realist mode, but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again.
27496|1|Southern California isn't exactly Transylvania, but the settings are effectively spooky. And there's some amusing satire on the horror-pic genre. The plot is weak, though.
56028|1|Utilizing lots of complicated, well-choreographed steadicam shots, La Salle directs with confidence -- this may yet be his true calling.
58066|1|The eleventh hour plot twists are both fitting and unexpected.
51034|1|This debut for helmer and vid vet Dewey Nicks and scribe David H. Steinberg, a feverishly naughty revenge comedy, is awful and subversively spunky at the same time.
65038|1|It's not only a good watch but is informative.
1544|1|"It may once have been a second-rate ""B"" picture, but John Woo turns it into something better."
31612|0|For about an hour it's a fine, ghoulish carnival sideshow, and that has its charms, but there's a thin desperation about the climax.
4082|0|It's unclear just how much sympathy we are to extend the unrepentant and bullying title character.
90680|1|Stranger Than Fiction has a self-regard that can grate, but Ferrell and Thompson give winning performances that suggest the film's aim is true.
8804|1|Although the 1940 edition rushes to tell its story, the 1944 rendition is content to linger over details of Victorian atmosphere, plush set designs, and spooky noises.
97585|1|Another comedy winner; if you have to ask why, it's because it involves the Knocked Up guy. Hilarious - even the Beatles bit, this looks set to be a hit.
23444|0|A movie a little at odds with itself--finely executed, but too cutely clever for its own tough, gutsy material.
80452|1|...doesn't quite capture the magic of the old television series, but it makes a good stab at trying.
94912|1|...marks a substantial leap forward in terms of [Eli Roth's] directorial abilities.
23978|1|As it is a remake, it doesn't have the shock Lord Of The Rings possessed upon its release, but this is a beautiful beast of a B-movie, thrilling and touching.
7113|1|You have to love Best Brains for doing their best to reward the fans.
67031|1|I haven't been crazy about a lot of Van Sant's recent work, but what he does here is simply astonishing.
37205|1|rather dull
20503|1|It may have cost five times the amount of any other Disney film in the preceding two decades, but by God that money ended up on screen.
89773|0|Warrior is a good-looking film that feels more like an allegory about the power of positive thinking than a drama.
6897|0|The new Diabolique mostly dispenses with subtlety, contenting itself with regularly scheduled cathartic jolts that pass for suspense in our degraded culture.
99825|0|M. Night Shyamalan offers up low-intensity thrills that fail to match the shivery shudders of his best work (THE SIXTH SENSE, SIGNS). His patented approach - mixing domestic drama with horror - plays out on a much larger canvas.
86640|1|A slouching portrait of Bukowski that's likeable, if superficial.
19768|0|The Friday the 13th saga continues with this typically underwhelming entry...
12448|1|There is no easy watching to be gained here, but nor is this a hard slog -- each scene is beautifully crafted, painting a vivid and fascinating picture of Tarkovsky's vision.
19746|1|Unsophisticated by today's standards perhaps, but still contains plenty to satisfy the dedicated gore-hound.
953|1|The movie has no moral or message, does not attempt to rehabilitate Nico as an anti-heroine, and finds mostly emptiness and sadness in her life. I have a feeling Nico would have enjoyed it.
25994|1|Oneof the best of the bunch!
27412|1|How does Disney do it?
14265|1|Spielberg had paced the film beautifully so that one is always on edge, tensed for those scary moments that turn out to be false alarms, and left somehow totally unprepared for the real shocks.
46061|1|Mindlessly enjoyable escapist fare in which a courtroom drama is enlivened by intercutting it with a couple of wholly improbable but spectacular chases in--and above--New York.
15693|0|[An] insipid, lifeless, animated feature.
79730|0|Hung out to dry with nowhere to go but in quicksand.
95976|0|As a comedy of male delusion, Night seems to shrink from its flimsy dramatic subtexts; as a probing of dream and reality in love, its pretensions to depth suggest a neutered comedic courage: Woody Allen-lite.
78699|1|Gorgeous, but also very violent.
5224|0|The film treats this profoundly preposterous plot as if it were a serious idea.
43004|1|That Jane will see the flaws of her theory is a given, but it's an intriguing, if uneven, journey of discovery.

75866|0|Wistful oddball documentary by George Hickenlooper.
84275|1|The Criterion Collection's 4K Blu-ray offers a beautiful transfer of Ettore Scola's long unavailable gem.
27434|0|Parker's shuttlecock technique only succeeds in throwing Wilde's cascading rhythms seriously out of whack and makes it hard to attend to the language as fully as one would like.
58637|1|Undeniably impressive.
25045|0|In the absence of anything resembling structure, character, point of view or sense of purpose, there is no place else for this empty project to go.
92449|0|TURISTAS seemed to have a fascinating, cautionary premise,but in execution, the movie turned out to be messy and decidedly unmemorable.
84120|0|Strictly for anyone who ever wanted to know what it would be like if Chris Columbus directed El Topo.
91355|1|The Science Of Sleep is truly a delight at times, a startlingly original piece of work that's not as accessible as Eternal Sunshine but is every bit as magnificent when in full flow.
64977|0|In the second half of the film, Frei's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives Nachtwey for self-analysis.
22448|0|Nodding, winking and sighing, The Lodger lumbers its way to a final twist so anticlimactic and silly as to warrant an incredulous titter.
96237|0|"It's high time for ""Resident Evil: Enough is Enough""."
31074|1|An extremely literate science-fiction drama.
17362|1|Tarantino's tribute to creative influences, writer Elmor Leonard and blaxploitation star Grier, results in a more mature but less audacious film; last shot, taken from Queen Christina, only shows how magical Garbo was and Grier isn't
63409|0|Hawks delivers his usual heavy-handed direction, but the film's premise is too flimsy to spread over two hours. The script is marred by tired comic routines and slow pacing.
7345|1|A sparkling blend of sci-fi and comedy that affectionately spoofs every Star Trek cliché known to man, Romulan, or Klingon.
66631|1|A raucous crowd pleaser with a pumping soundtrack, some awe inspiringly talented kids, and perfect comic performances.
55302|1|Cushing's cool demeanour and grace were ideally suited to his role as the quietly manic Baron and he gives a chillingly subtle performance.
63788|1|An intelligent and extremely well-made romantic drama that tells an intriguing story with economy and insight.
75863|1|Wisely switching from film to DV when the setting demands a more subtle camera situation, it's a mature documentary from a veteran of the form.
71027|1|Too amiable to cook up anything truly memorable...
36239|1|Taught, scary and still lots of fun.
5823|1|Campion never underestimates the power physical obsession exerts over human souls, and, for once, a modern film treats erotic passion honestly.
16625|0|(Joel Schumacher) tenía ganas de hacer un musical y se sacó las ganas; sólo que no bastaba con poner gente cantando envuelta en trajes brillantes.
73666|1|One of cinema's great comedies.
84078|1|The true measure of a star is his ability to transform ordinary material into movie magic. James Stewart's presence in this routine crime-drama gives a plain film a complex core.
3771|1|It's more than a worthy capper to Malle's brilliant career.
32238|1|Much of the three-hour movie takes place in the prison, but the resonant characterization, expansive plotting, and judicious use of exterior locations and flashbacks turn the walls into windows.
37636|0|Bloody, boring and pandering, is as poisonous as the drug trade it pretends to defame.
31855|1|The entire cast is superb, each with a good ear for comedy.
76975|0|Balsmeyer may remind you of the guy at the party who, after one too many shots, puts a lampshade on his head. It's funny for maybe a moment -- until you realize, to your horror, that he doesn't know when to stop.
93451|1|Sweet, predictable date movie. Teens OK.
22642|1|Performances to die for
43096|0|What's annoying about this version is that it's been dumbed down for American audiences.
93502|0|Fails to raise even a titter.
67428|1|The winning conceit of producer/director Lauren Lazin's flamboyant documentary about the life of Tupac Shakur is that the late rapper's voice is the primary source the audience hears.
76125|1|A powerful, chilling, and affecting study of one man's dying fall.
73579|1|After the Rehearsal may well be another Bergman classic.
36485|1|The journey of Maximus, from triumph on the battlefield through despair and degradation in slavery and then to a final epiphany in the Colosseum is an exciting one - and Russell Crowe plays the character with considerable toughness and authority.
49325|0|I was wishing I was sitting through Bones a second time.
38997|1|Nothing is sacred... Of course, you should expect this from the director who made poo funny when the South Park creators were still in diapers.
74393|1|Baby Doll (1956) has been called notorious, salacious, revolting, dirty, steamy, lewd, suggestive, morally repellent and provocative.
67536|0|Takes the post-apocalyptic themes of Children of Men and blends it with the jaded morality of Lord of the Flies to questionable success
46406|1|I tend to doubt that you will ever see this movie double billed with Citizen Kane, but the two movies are structured pretty similarly.
55839|0|... so many directions with so much silliness that a surprise no longer surprises.
16303|1|Such ease of shorthand (the earth Mother Hubbard, the three sisters as mother, whore, and lawyer) detracts from the kind heart of Soul Food.

85441|1|Having a dream isn't easy ...
6718|0|A silly little trifle with more wisecracks than laughs.
66415|0|an intriguing mess
41440|1|In many respects this is a black counterpart to The Naked Gun, and very nearly as funny; the bounty of antimacho gags is both unexpected and refreshing.
91806|1|The success Fields has with this film comes through the uncomfortable intersection between comedy, melodrama and tragedy. Oh, and romance.
51414|0|You'd think a movie with Bob Hoskins, Michael Caine, Helen Mirren and Tom Courtenay couldn't be all bad, but you'd be wrong.
44917|0|The film is like an after-school special turned over for re-editing to both a romance novelist and a lurid specialist in peekaboo.
35898|0|...remains an instantly forgettable, wannabe epic.
90598|1|Woody Allen's London-set comedy caper doesn't break any new ground, but he and Match Point muse Scarlett Johansson are good for some odd-couple laughs.
40494|1|Sutil recordatorio de que, en pleno inicio del siglo XXI, la imaginación y la pureza de corazón se mantienen más que vigentes.
62638|1|Beautifully shot and executed, the effort is generous with disturbing, puzzling behavior, yet wise enough to provide clear clues to aid interpretation.
76869|1|It's an oddity in some ways, and its brief appearance in cinemas can only be the precursor to a DVD release, which is how it will mostly be seen. It's a smart, sharp piece of work, however big the screen.
49263|0|[Mamet] is a giant in several areas, but I'm not sure moviemaking is one of them.
25056|0|It really is that bad.

17886|1|Well-acted drama full of Clinton-era jabs.

25148|0|The biggest question for me is 'Why?'
84723|1|It is pretty, and it stays just left of the dial of darlingness, and Cornish's is the most goddamn, gosh-wow debut I've seen in years.

97260|1|Smith turns in a terrific performance, nailing Neville's angst while allowing room for humor.
8093|1|The plot is hamstrung by trite formulas, and there's too much violence and family tension for very young viewers. Shaquille O'Neal is likable as the title character, though.
44678|0|"""so bland it makes Pablum seem like hot curry"""
91581|0|It's less of a labyrinth than a forest path, one that takes you through wonderful scenery but doesn't lead anywhere.
72936|0|Perhaps it's only just that a movie about a loser should be a loser itself.
2557|1|The three women are so spirited and funny -- so emotionally keyed into all the hearts and flowers -- that they give the movie their own kind of truth.
16469|1|The briskly paced, high-spirited movie is complemented by a funny score that includes the old disco hit You Sexy Thing.
90042|0|The duds-to-gags ratio is way too high and the general aesthetic (visual and verbal) way too crummy.
85933|1|The script is little more than an excuse for letting a bouncy team of sketch comics have their heads. Unlike most films pasted together in this way, it displays a certain cohesion.
50099|1|Not all the gags work, not all the gross-outs serve the greater good, but How High is funny, quick, and the very definition of a pleasant surprise.
949|1|With extraordinary technique, Ofteringer paints a moody, melancholy picture of a legend who decayed into the ghost of herself.
5619|1|Ai No Corrida is an undeniably powerful, stylish and impressive piece of work.
55058|1|The fascinating, evolving relationship between Carla and Paul is the real subject of Read My Lips. The labyrinthine crime-drama landscape they navigate is the icing on the cake.
20894|0|Those not yet wise to formulaic pablum are likely to enjoy this ice hockey kiddie ensemble comedy. But their older escorts might want to bring a novel and a flashlight, or a Walkman or portable television with earphones.
70012|1|If the ending is predictable and even anti-climactic, chalk it up to a first effort. The rest of the film, brilliantly shot by Tak Fujimoto, is worth a look-see.
6659|1|A fascinating examination of the artistry, camaraderie and idiosyncrasies among a generation enigmatic jazz giants.
62464|0|I got the feeling that a whole lot of talented people had gone and wasted their time on a project too bland to be worth it.

31699|1|This 1940 film is one of the best literary adaptations ever (and one of the quickest too -- it was in theaters within a year of the book's publication).
35121|1|From the start, the film bowls you over with excitement and for those who can latch on, it's a nonstop ride.
43584|1|It crawls under the skin by placing you firmly in the shoes of the mourner.
13346|1|The biggest and the best of Hollywood's super-spectacles.
19040|1|A gloriously, heart-rendingly beautiful, stirring picture of a generation in British family life.
32833|1|Awesome jailbreak film with gritty performances.
19489|0|Granted, this is a British film and so you expect a restrained, understated reaction from the runners, but it's this decided lack of fun that makes the movie drag so much.
11401|1|As lovely and intriguing as 'Jean de Florette' in every way.
88185|0|[Uwe Boll] is fast becoming known as one of the worst directors on the planet.
28616|1|Not to bad for a Chase comedy. Love those lamb fries.
13801|1|The first big hit directed by Brian De Palma.
11832|1|Accomplished but detached; you're pulled in, but you couldn't be blamed for resisting.
101242|0|It's ironic when the tactics it uses to ratchet up the suspense actually reduces the very real tension that gets communicated in its first half.
30387|0|If there's a point to this, it's what Herzog's point always is: That obsession can drive you nuts. I'm not sure I needed a freaky German traipsing through the jungle for 2 1/2 hours to drive that point home.
89698|0|Making fun of art students is like shooting Darwin fish in a barrel.
63500|1|Leterrier is nowhere near Lee as a craftsman, but he's much more comfortable with the demands of lowbrow genre filmmaking.
61742|1|Top Stars, Top Music, Top Fun.
85038|0|According to this film, New York is a joyless place where people live only to drop names, attend parties, cheat on loved ones and brood.
37412|1|Bob Clark's teen sex comedy carries a stamp of social satrie that is timeless.
83175|1|One of the great films of French cinema.
94237|1|It's a richly seen and felt movie, but not one with a feel-good message.
94389|0|The second panel in Haneke's trilogy (preceded by Seventh Continent and followed by 71 Fragments) offers a chilling and haunting postmodern look at isolation, alienation and violence, with a critique of mass media effects on actual behavior.
24726|0|It's one thing to be offbeat and unconventional and quite another to be unbelievable.
86391|1|While it weakens in its final stretch...A History of Violence succeeds enormously thanks to the strength of its direction and performances.
95928|1|...benefits from the inclusion of several genuinely funny whacked-out bits of comedy...
55177|0|Julie Davis is the Kathie Lee Gifford of film directors, sadly proving once again ego doesn't always go hand in hand with talent.
25984|0|A rather superfluous experience.
83440|1|Artfully directed, professionally performed and just twisty enough to make viewers get lost in the overtly Hitchcockian trappings...
81640|1|About the only CGI illusion occurs when the bad guy exhales cigarette smoke through the blowhole of his tracheotomy. But Pinkaew isn't blowing smoke: this is the real deal.
66479|0|A misbegotten musical adaptation of Dickens' much too perennial tale.
48832|1|Earthbound but not bad.
75272|0|I find it tediously pretentious, but there are striking images in it, and it does get across a vague impression of Frankensteinian meddling with the brain.
80142|1|Wholly entertaining and memorable, Theatre of Blood is ripe camp, an excellent film, and a lasting tribute to the career of one of the most important actors in the genre.
5395|1|By the end of the movie, whether or not you're a member of Sinn Fein, the Brits' brutality toward the Conlons will get your Irish up.
17190|0|This Home Alone clone is genetically spliced with childhood memories of Tom and Jerry.
78215|0|Ponderous and superficial, and no art deco fashions or tasteful drawing rooms can compensate for it.
59618|1|Splendid Boulting Brothers satire with a great Peter Sellers performance.
5988|1|The film [has] a raw, sometimes discomfiting immediacy... The cast attacks their roles with matching intensity.
45586|1|Playing a character perched precisely on the point between adolescence and manhood, Broderick is enjoyable all the way.
28968|0|A leaden exercise in what can go wrong when movies attempt to explore mysterious forces with dated special effects and easy symbolism.
97528|1|"... when we look back at ""There Will Be Blood"" decades from now, we will probably be saying the sprawling epic about oil, family, faith, greed and deception is Anderson's crowning achievement. And that's saying a lot."
79655|1|Davis' near-crazed performance being over-the-top but satisfying in a campy way.
89342|0|What is Craig Kilborn doing in this movie?
50334|1|No film from the Zeroes - hell, maybe ever - more forcefully imparted the horrors of war as thoroughly, coherently and hauntingly. Even justified wars run rampant with monstrosities, and this showed just how critical camaraderie can be in conquering them.
62388|0|One of the problems with The In-Laws is that it spends as much time with the uninteresting and unfunny wedding story as it does with the spy stuff.
17900|0|Like the politicians it criticizes, the film loses sight of its ideals.
41266|1|Overhyped - but worthwhile
26533|1|A cross-cultural gem that is spiked with superb performances, colorful characters, and one of the great closing sequences in recent memory.
53826|0|It's not a great picture by any means, yet there are highlights in Rapid Fire worth savoring, most centered on Lee's martial art choreography.
26900|1|A film that combines a stunning sensuality with a rigorous economy.
94422|0|Britain's most-beloved mute behaving like a buffoon while vacationing in France.
36560|1|Criminally underrated with two great performances from the lead males.
28386|1|[An] entertaining little comedy that should be forgiven for not living to its potential.
100670|1|Weiland's occasional heavy-handedness is more than redeemed by the lightness of his cast.
17030|1|It proves that Disney can be beaten at their own game.
37796|1|What's not to like? Shaft rocked!
639|1|The most intriguing is a glassy-eyed follower whose right hand shoots out a hissing reptile that can extend itself for miles. Exotic creatures like these make watching Mortal Kombat feel like being in a high-tech fun house.
2449|1|Bushwhacked isn't much of a movie. But it made me laugh more than I'd like to admit.
96661|1|Fessenden, who directed, produced, cowrote, edited and even has a part in the film rightly values mood at least as much as he does delivering more abominable snow monsters.
62013|1|At the film's center Bruckner more than holds her own, beautifully capturing the anger, uncertainty and yearnings of an unhappy kid impatient for her 'real' life to begin.
22680|0|This is a terrible, terrible worthless movie that you shouldn't give any time to.
1819|1|Arguably Lee's best film since Do The Right Thing.
19904|1|Young Ms. Harris is probably the movie's most powerful element.
28100|0|ovaj film zahtijeva mnogo strpljenja od prosje%u010Dnog gledatelja
81207|0|The discomfort zones of a young girl cry for sympathetic toughness, not Ball's snickering at pubic hair and clammy suburbanites
32726|1|The two leads play to their strengths.
44606|1|A spectacular start to one of Hollywood's most surprising and popular franchises ever.
29578|0|Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.
64485|1|A spirited crowd-pleaser.
46656|1|A bunch of rednecks get mad and seek revenge. If that sounds good to you, have at it.
91988|1|Gela Babluani, according to the film's sparse press kit, is only 26 years old but already knows more about suspense than some filmmakers learn in a career.
20157|1|classic mid-1980s Spielberg
78566|1|It's a fascinating film that goes off in so many directions that the viewer may have a hard time getting a handle on it.
60827|1|Gerald L. C. Copley has done a first rate adaptation of the true story of Joy Adamson, who with hubby George involuntarily domesticated several pet lions.
34268|1|A gorgeously shot and smartly written outdoors adventure.
85915|1|Chances are excellent that Carroll Ballard's latest film 'Duma' isn't playing in a theater anywhere near you. That's a shame. It's one of those rare children's films that actually succeeds in delighting tots and their parents.
92381|0|A lowbrow spy spoof that can only go so far with such a silly plot.
43551|0|The Mummy Returns is all but a patchwork quilt made up of, if not leftover scenes, then scrap ideas.
81698|1|With her whiskey-marinated, desperate-for-love, full-tilt blooz mama wildcat yowl still intact, Janis Joplin is the best thing about this film...
36708|0|A bloated musical that is far from great and more like average.
91468|1|To Palfi's credit, he never attempts to titillate. His mind-boggling visual imagination is ably supported by Gergely Poharnok's camera and the art direction.
21521|1|Every character moves fluidly and imaginatively against an extravaganza of detailed background and dazzling effects, all emboldened by fascinating colored textures.
5322|0|A visually arresting but emotionally uninvolving dark comedy.
7046|0|a mixture of live-action and stop-motion animation that is heavy on fever-dream spectacle, but fairly shallow in terms of character
48447|0|The movie is light years behind the touching celebration of youth found in Stand By Me.
54|1|Offers a winning portrait of sassy black sister solidarity.
80411|1|Fine performances by Conti, Takeshi (brilliant in his first dramatic role), Sakamoto (a Japanese pop star in his film acting debut who also contributed the memorable score), and Bowie enhance this provocative film.
55382|1|You end up with a fast-paced, sci-fi, action hero, monster movie that screams, the makers hope, for a franchise.
80666|1|Bill Cosby ghost movie has some iffy humor, profanity.
26122|0|Worse than awful!
15345|0|Pre-millennium tension is still the best explanation for the recent tidal wave of disaster movies--which hasn't made it any less boring.
11593|1|Robbins' heavy-handedness still can't derail this memorable jab at far-right demagoguery.
55663|0|It's a real riot when a guy goes tumbling and thudding down a 300-step flight of stone stairs only to climb back up and do it again. What inspired comedy!
79460|1|Penn's film displays a deep and abiding love for America, set against a critique of the uglier aspects that exist alongside all that the beauty.
31565|1|This series should be sealed in a time capsule. It is on my list of the 10 greatest films of all time, and is a noble use of the medium.
5273|0|Here is a movie with broad ambitions: It wants to be a caper, a comedy, a romance, and a showcase for MacAulay Culkin. That's too much of a stretch.
20945|1|Live-action version keeps its thrill and charm.
28353|0|Merely proves that feeble, witless jokes will flop no matter how grand the setting.
42351|0|Series 7 casts us adrift in a contempo world ruled by gladiatorial zeal and bloodless emperors.
89605|1|It's the third successful teaming of choreographer Busby Berkeley with stars Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler.
89987|0|Feels like two movies: one good, one pretty pointless, neither of which is worth the hype.
34737|1|Porém, o filme é bem-sucedido naquele que é o quesito mais importante para este tipo de produção: assusta.
33982|0|A contrived plot that expects you to believe in something far more outrageous than a plump elf who delivers gifts.
22300|0|Considering the nature of the production, it's no wonder that Hitch never gets inside any of the characters
49293|0|It has moments of sweetness, and moments of hilarious comedy; but when it comes down to it, the tendency to use gross-out tactics makes it hardly worth sitting through.
63976|1|It's a well-done satire that only the thinnest of skins would find insulting.
101548|1|This well-designed and executed piece of entertainment is actually very satisfying.
46870|1|Promoted with the apt slogan 'Forget everything you have ever seen', Jodorowsky's film takes no prisoners, except maybe for purposes of torture.
72771|1|A tight-fisted and paranoid mini-classic.
74634|1|Altman's signature telephoto framing, omnipresent murals depicting demon-like creatures, and an atonal score add a creeping menace to uncanny California desert settings.
33387|1|Shows how our lives are often throttled by the emotions of fear and desire.
27024|0|Terrible '80s sequel has violence, nuclear weapons.
24228|0|It's been done before, and Raimi doesn't do it much differently or put his own stamp on it.
80253|1|[Truffaut] ecreates childhood, and yet he sees it objectively, too: He remembers not only the funny moments but the painful ones.
8736|1|The most complex film made by Alfred Hitchcock.
38312|1|Scary Movie is a sporadically hilarious parody of teen horror movies that too frequently seems half-baked.
79744|0|A stale spook concoction from the William Castle-Robb White production team.
80380|1|At once a lament to the ravages of age and an examination of those tiny foibles which separate reality from dramatic artifice, it's a baffling and intricate film which, although light on conventional pleasures, still manages to provoke and beguile.
7269|0|Might help you get to sleep at night?
98852|1|a nice choice for family movie night if you have kids who haven't yet reached their teens
96142|0|Radcliffe is good at showing vulnerability but without the skills to give it gradation. The magic doesn't work for him this time.
16847|1|In terms of sweep, ambition and precocious cinematic competence, it heralds the arrival of a new talent.
30453|0|With its sluggish pace and awkward continuity, 'Crazy in Alabama' emerged as one of the most disappointing films released in 1999.
76232|1|...may not be the most exciting or well-focused drama of the year, but it manages to engage our intellect most of the time and keep us guessing well up to the end.
37257|1|It's a nice, if undemanding, Yuletide treat.
26959|1|High camp about child abuse... oy Faye!
91700|0|"There are people who will see ""The Marine"" just because it features John Cena, and those people will not be disappointed: The movie does, in fact, feature John Cena."
12658|1|Bittersweet romance with mature themes, sex, profanity.
21143|0|[Director] Miner is tasked with getting these characters in one setting, and he accomplishes his duty for the most part.
88595|1|...it's always good to see Ford back in action mode. He lifts a routine film out of total mediocrity by his very presence.
7221|0|There are too many moments of unintentional comedy caused by the ropey macho dialogue and the hammy performances of bad guys William Sadler and Barry Corbin.
55974|1|Even if the case against Kissinger is not fully convincing, the documentary keeps you glued to your seat and thinking long after you've left the theater.
13085|1|George C. Scott's intuitive, powerhouse performance paints a complex picture of a steadfast soldier that believed firmly in reincarnation, colorful language, and the glories of war.
52294|1|This charming, thought-provoking New York fest of life and love has its rewards.
34322|1|Though its plot wins no points for originality, Breaking Away is a thoroughly delightful light comedy.
96514|0|A resoundingly unfunny sports-movie spoof that should have gone straight to DVD.
86611|1|One of the best music documentaries ever of one of the most unusual musicians ever...
86709|1|...Baumbach's most emotionally potent and visually coherent film to date.
5333|1|Movies are, after all, about fakery; so is the story of Norville's rise and fall and redemption.
26911|0|The Mummy shuffles down to The Big Easy and starts getting squeezy!
38389|1|"Duel in the Sun (1946) was branded ""Lust in the Dust"" at the time of its release, a classic epic western"
80549|1|Likably goofy Larry Cohen horror satire.
25892|1|Brynner is very good, his austere presence and unflinching intent making him seem indestructible.
39976|0|Just when you thought they couldn't get worse, Saturday Night Live-based movies hit a new low.
7197|1|Photographed by the great Russell Boyd but looking drab and washed out for 108 minutes, the movie just gets by on heart and a conversation-stopping finale.
84794|1|... surprisingly fresh and charming overall.
23182|1|Part gritty prison drama, part inner-city chronicle, the energetic Slam defies easy categorization, serving as a compelling plea for black males of how to survive in oppressive society. The film won the 1998 Sundance Jury Award for Best Drama.
78381|1|Love is a delicate thing, and identity even more so. Enduring Love breathtakingly tears both asunder to find them anew...it is, in a word, exquisite.
1257|0|Despite all his craft and sincerity, [Eastwood] and screenwriter Richard LaGravenese can't quite turn Robert James Waller's cardboard best-seller into flesh and bone.
87989|0|Casanova is just a farce, true, but there's a smugness to the proceedings that leaves a bad aftertaste.
27986|1|It is in the observation of human detail, and in many memorable little scenes that the film scores most heavily over other epics, and in which it finds an inner strength.
6182|1|Proves that the good life cannot be purchased but must be patiently constructed out of love and devotion.
47100|1|It's real ugly, but darkly funny at the same time.
73722|1|John Huston's version of Malcolm Lowry's dense, poetic unfilmable book is ambitious but only semi-effective in conveying this cult novel's tone; it's ultimately saved by the towering performance of Albert Finney as the alcoholic self-destructive consul
92914|1|Hit musical La La Land drew inspiration from The Young Girls of Rochefort and it deserves revisitation; it is one of the greatest films of the 1960s.
93880|0|Offers its moments of requisite thriller twists that will appeal to fans of that genre.
11176|0|"...Sleepover"" will have you snoring in no time."
28950|1|More than lives up to the promise Troche showed in Go Fish.

93805|1|"""The reality of love's disappointments enriches the film's heroine, who never married in real life, and brings a 200-year-old figure into living focus."""
92185|0|This could have been far more illuminating, challenging, or at the very least entertaining.
33371|0|A dreary, turgid melodrama featuring the much ballyhooed debut of pop diva Whitney Houston.
51436|1|If it's not quite Sunset Blvd., Vincente Minnelli's The Bad and the Beautiful stands on its own as a scathing portrait of Hollywood's cutthroat ways and means.
90379|1|The edgy humor and oddly compelling lead characters make it well worth seeing.
1768|0|In attempting to make its politics palatable as entertainment, the film has grafted them onto a boatload of Hollywood implausibilities whose excesses cripple believability.
5070|1|The film is actually like high school, and not a movie about high school. There's a big difference, and that's why the film has quickly become one of the biggest cult classics of the last twenty years.
33501|1|This is an original, a stark and (sorry) biting work far more complex, both stylistically and thematically, than first meets the eye.
67168|1|Luscious modern French noir.
96071|1|A persuasive argument that the inception of, and response to, the Iraq War perverted America's ideals and intellect. Its moderate temperament hides obvious roars: Remembering outrage is all that will keep this from again occurring unopposed.
23064|1|Sinise is quite good as the guy trying desperately to prove that he's innocent, even as he has nagging self-doubts.
55210|1|Anchored by a terrific performance by Abbass, Satin Rouge shows that the idea of women's self-actualization knows few continental divides.
8805|0|a moderately entertaining variation on the old gothic thriller
77073|0|The prequel to William Friedkin popular shock opera emphasizes unpleasantness over scares and coherence.
63785|1|Whatever your politics, you'll find the film funny.
119|1|Skip the Harrison Ford remake and go straight to this original classic.
30185|0|A comedy without humor, a tragedy without emotion, and a story without meaning.
20647|1|Not great. Not an all-time legendary accomplishment of family-friendly cinema. But pretty darn decent altogether.
26650|1|Gets by well enough on style and star chemistry and the basic allure of watching a tightly-planned caper unfold.
63843|1|Though the storytelling is a bit lopsided, the slapdash quality is charming overall, and the movie benefits from colorful characters and a couple of hilarious scenes.
20212|1|A stoic Heston, a nice turn for Robinson, and see-through ironies.
17538|0|The first (and as it transpired only) feature film to exploit the enormous success of pop quintet the Spice Girls, this is an attempt to capture the comedic style of the Beatles films, and not nearly as bad as it might have been.
88713|1|What's real and true about Winter Passing is the relationship between Don and Reese, the father and daughter who wear their damaged dynamic on their sleeves for all to see.
81156|1|It's fascinating and entertaining, but rather dull as well.
21016|1|A charming adventure tale, in the spirit of 1930's serials, The Rocketeer is a fun ride.
8591|1|If you're a fan of martial arts, and fancy an alternative to the heavy going comic adaptations ahead, then this is your bag.
17720|0|You've been warned.
10199|0|Lovely animation and trippy story ruined by never-ending, excruciating songs.
42657|0|Rourke and Johnson fail to credibly play squinty soulmates, looking as though they hurriedly went their separate ways once the cameras cut.
72055|0|I don't think any critic could have predicted a turkey like this based on the immense level of talent that is involved here.
2169|0|A thriller without thrills.
17945|0|A Price Above Rubies would have more impact if filmmaker Boaz Yakin didn't allow its energy level to sag in several scenes, and if he avoided some lapses into Hollywood-style sensationalism.
15037|1|In almost every respect, Donnie Brasco is an original, the unexpected rebirth of an old and oft-told tale.
89767|1|The action is non stop and the special effects jaw dropping, with a scene involving San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge an incredible highlight
73263|0|High style and noirish overtones about mind control and brainwashing in corporate America. Nothing new there, so nothing new here.
27048|1|Lon Chaney lives!

99072|1|... has fun with the tale and Americanizes the genre without losing the pleasures of its Asian inspirations.
41275|1|Though beginning as a tale about alienated youth, the film quickly devolves into a melodrama of a son (Sean Penn) corrupted by his own father (Christopher Walken) in a valueless world.
85243|1|Director Wise keeps the action fresh and lively, drawing excellent performances from Newman, Angeli as Mrs Graziano and Mineo in a small but significant role.
87310|1|Its dark, dog-eat-dog vision of the world we live in may give you geopolitical nightmares.
40758|1|Stone's hyperkinetic direction keeps you riveted. He stalks every move Champlain makes around the studio as he revs up bigots, druggies, sex fiends and religious fanatics whom he then viciously puts down.
50182|1|Jim Carrey seems a bit out of his depth in this often-engaging anti-HUAC film.
48493|1|Unforgettable
52463|1|Like eavesdropping on people you didn't even know existed in America
77514|1|Well acted and intriguing...
30088|1|There's a very special, and weird, purity about the Bond formula as it is presented here: all the excess is in place but still reined in by some last measure of discipline.
71888|1|"A deserving modern classic, even if only for being so bold as to describe Katie Holmes' breasts as being ""the exact opposite"" of the Holocaust."
46578|0|Better than its sequels -- that's not saying much.
88971|1|This film about cigarettes is addictive as the substance and much more fun. It's hard to believe that you could have compassion for someone who shills for Big Tobacco.
2083|1|A hip indie version of Truffaut's Day for Night, Living in Oblivion celebrates the very act of filmmaking as grand folly, a triumph of absurdist heroism.
91868|0|Having cut his teeth on documentaries, Kevin Macdonald acts as if a shaky-cam aesthetic alone is enough to fuel dramatic tension.
98762|0|This is a prime example of a movie that isn't bad, per se, just unnecessary, a competently made but wholly unremarkable trifle.
64924|0|...The images are unsupported by storytelling of any particular gravity...
89388|1|"Because of Hopkins, because of Ann-Margret (who hardly looks like that Ann-Margret, adeptly proving herself as an occasional dramatic actress), and because of Burgess Meredith as well as Fats the dummy, ""Magic"" is one of the top-notch films of the 1970s."
4942|1|"""Carlito's Way"" is best watched as lively, colorful posturing and as a fine demonstration of this director's bravura visual style."
8638|1|The film is a Hepburn triumph, and moviegoers who resent the theatre's habit of requisitioning their stars may feel that Miss Hepburn's time on the stage has not been spent in vain and that she simply prepared herself for this achievement.
14001|1|OK family fun casts Arnold with Sinbad.
45625|0|Where are the laughs (and stars) of Caddy 1?
34022|1|In order to get into this film, one must suspend a truckload of disbelief.

32339|1|Its portrait of a floundering community is the film's strongest virtue.
31495|1|For all the emphasis on its leads, Moonstruck is a brilliantly cast ensemble piece and two smaller supporting roles deserve a special mention.
32373|0|You long for [Williams] to break the metal mold, if only for a minute, to remind you that you are watching the best improvisational comedian of this millennium.
62101|0|Once it gets the bodily function jokes out of its system (sorry), it settles into being a fairly agreeable little movie.
23009|1|Between this masterpiece and that other Ed (Wood), TIm Burton and Johnny Depp are at their dual-career best. Ed Wood is about how insane Hollywood is -- and Edward Scissorhands delivers the pure magic that, once in a rare while, escapes the place.
78401|1|Just when you think you've got it sussed, the movie throws in some audacious twists, resulting in one of the most memorable climaxes in recent screen history.
82068|1|I must admit that I came out of DiG! with a certain degree of admiration for Newcombe -- and for this documentary.
63527|1|[Witherspoon's] so charming.
97376|1|Fierce without being cruel, sweet without becoming saccharine, and never short of hilarious, it's not only the best comedy of the year, but one of the best films, period.
76394|1|While recognizing that it's not any sort of great piece of acting by Robert Mitchum or a searing portrait of war, if one accepts The Enemy Below as an action-filled war movie, it's thoroughly entertaining stuff.
30250|0|The entire film is a haphazard scrapbook of highs and lows.
27777|1|If you want some mindless entertainment then go see this, if not, wait for the video.
78947|1|Of the four extant versions of this perennial horror classic, Paul Wegener's 1920 version remains the best.
1293|1|Mel Gibson's Oscared, bloody Scottish spectacle.
20472|1|"One of Spielberg's most difficult ""problem"" films."
40902|0|Rather hollow effort.
62989|0|[Lumet] may be the quintessential New York director, but A Stranger Among Us argues that he should stay out of Brooklyn.
4038|1|One of Spike's most underrated and insightful.
74469|1|A minor masterpiece from a major artist.
27189|1|"The hokey ""xenomorphs"" would egregiously emphasize the film's subtle indictment of human prejudice."
76368|1|Explores the structure of the family in its many possible forms and makes an argument that Colin Farrell is perhaps one of the most charming blokes on the planet.
86029|0|A generic duffer that's as exciting as a hole in the ground.
21889|1|Darkly humorous and visually inventive, Burton's second film, which deservedly won the Makeup Oscar, fulfilled the promise he showed in his debut, launching a brilliant career with Batman and other original movies, many of which starring Johnny Depp.
30481|0|Three to Tango is too careful, too proper in its approach, to shift into high gear.
43119|1|If not exactly enjoyable, then at least halfway tolerable.
29212|1|I can't imagine how the filmmakers went about it, let alone pulled the whole thing off, but their film comes together in unpredictable and remarkably pleasurable ways.
15795|1|The plot, trifling as it is, doesn't much matter. What makes the movie such a hoot are the clever gags, imaginative special effects, and the snappy byplay between the well-matched Jones and Smith.
86507|1|A timeless treat.
95610|1|Tell No One has shades of Hitchcock's Vertigo -- and not to its detriment. [An] extremely gripping and fascinating suspense film.
81303|0|The film works as a slice of life but has nothing valuable to say about people or the way they conduct their relationships.
32049|1|You'll see things that countless horror films have stolen, but unlike a lot of classic films that have been ripped off for years, this one holds up.
41430|0|Adequate pulp carried by the engaging Pam Grier
57251|0|Ghost Ship is better than Thir13en Ghosts--but we're talking incrementally.
15545|1|McGregor breathes life into a less-than-interesting role, Fitzgerald shines and Tompkinson is excellent as a man on the brink of cracking up. But Postlethwaite takes top honours ...
21910|1|Intriguing experimental film from Hitchcock
21895|1|An appealing mess.
54303|1|Damon Wayans and his younger brother Marlon make a terrific comedy team in Mo' Money.
63103|0|It's more dumbfounding that so much time is wasted on a cast of unknowns, second-stringers granted solos long before Kelly or Justin take center stage. Why not support with other first-season alums?
32225|0|Bizarre comedy of errors is surprisingly good-natured, but not that good.
63230|1|The actors make this fun if you can overlook the ludicrous view of Jeremy Leven's screenplay concerning how novels are written and what publishers generally pay for them.
48456|1|At times Zoolander threatens to disappear up its own catwalk, but it's often very funny stuff.
89975|1|It's to the film's credit that I still found it an enjoyable satire, as glossy and superficial as the industry it purports to skewer.
99754|1|This is such a lovely film from writer/director Daniele Luchetti, nostalgic perhaps, but with that indefinable Italian whimsy that takes serious political themes and undermines them beautifully.
41293|1|A big, colorful, entertaining movie that could only have been made in the 1950s.
102124|1|Recalls the old-fashioned, golden-age Hollywood movie-movies that wrapped forbidden desire, aching heartbreak, personal tragedy, war, adventure and breathtaking thrills in a glittering overlay of movie-star glamor.
20902|0|Director Brian Henson should have left brand expectations out of it and simply carried on in the vein of his father's excursions into fantasy.
55071|1|A well-meaning attempt to channel the spirit of the 60s counterculture.
70355|1|Has become modern classic, but falls so short of great.
58071|0|...more cartoonish than anything else...
9149|0|[An] intermittently entertaining but thoroughly conventional Biggie biopic.
64476|1|This one is for the Western fans who have been clamoring for classic tales of guns, revenge and a little hokey romance without an ensemble cast or gimmick to keep it afloat.
101791|0|Steams ahead with express-train determination, scooping on to its cow-catcher any cinemagoer hoping he can outrun yet another true-life drama about black sportsmen overcoming bygone bigotry.
52519|1|Kiddie-TV satire has foul-mouthed mania to spare, but never attains true inspiration.
51381|0|Jay Chandrasekhar helms this wacky vehicle with all the conviction of a defective police siren...feels more like an excuse for Chandrasekhar and his fratboy Broken Lizard comedy troupe players to merge and serve up their pet project just to kill some time
45613|0|Chevy Chase, as a socialite who sells the club to Mason, and Dan Aykroyd, as a psycho ex-Marine hired by Stack to dispatch his enemy, are pitifully awful.
95826|0|If they decide to make Daddy Day Spa with Martin Lawrence and Jim Belushi, I don't want to hear about it.
30642|1|Two hours long and anti-climactic, but Bond fans won't be disappointed.
22716|0|Last Night employs an intriguing 'what if' scenario and mines a few authentic moments, but is hampered by the narrow imagination of its young creator.
4090|0|You won't have a gay old time.
44105|1|A treat for baseball fans but might bore others.
45038|1|I'll make the radical claim that losing around ten minutes would have made the film flawless. But it's almost made up for by that ending...
38816|1|Isn't really about the Second World War, but rather about the senselessness of the Vietnam War . . .
101068|0|Pointlessly rancid and redundant...Hopefully, Disaster Movie will indeed vanish as quickly as a three-second burp at a chili-eating contest.
87697|1|Has neither hero nor villain, only humans. Beyond imperfect, they are complicated thinkers, lovers, dreamers, and performers.
3837|0|This setup is ludicrous, but actually it's the most credible thing in this whole sorry, dishonest film.
80595|1|One of John Carpenter's most underrated films, gory, grim and good.
102031|0|It's hugely silly, but peppy enough to be tolerable. What grates most are the patronising racial stereotypes: the dirty Mexican dogs are just waiting to be rescued by LA ladies and given a good bath.
47384|1|Good ghost story ... genuinely creepy.
86180|0|If Reiser's smart, he'll hire Falk for a new Columbo episode, 'The Case of the Roadkill Movie.'
25938|1|Massive marketing notwithstanding, the original film is still quite an achievement.
91635|0|On a sweltering July day in 1934, John Dillinger went to the movies and ended up dead. Now, 75 years later, the movies are killing him again.
84875|0|Against the rest of Rodriguez's work, it's mostly forgettable. But it gives you the feeling he's probably a pretty cool dad.
77121|0|Obviously the cast and crew don't care that this makes no sense--they got a great holiday in Fiji.

72939|1|Anyone who's seen a few romantic comedies, the older the better, will find something to like about The Baxter.
37722|0|If you're into Bakshi, it might be okay. I'm not. It isn't.
53744|0|Generic action film not good for kids, or anyone.
60721|1|The performances are astonishingly strong--edgy and kinetic, open and fearless.
31773|1|Sherritt has been in a lot of movies, but the role of Rev. Maclean seems like one he was born to play. He owns it, the way that Pitt and Sheffer own theirs, and as a result it takes no time at all to believe this group as a family and become involved.
47082|1|Greatly amusing, but its lasting achievement is DeVito's atmospheric authority, shaping a genuine filmmaking triumph in style and mood that deserves a standing ovation.
31028|1|A movie that is both a wow of a show and a masterpiece of misanthropy.
34246|1|By today's standards the film is tame, but back in 1956, Vadim's feature debut was sensational and scandalous, catapulting Brigitte Bardot (who was married to Vadim) to the status of international sex icon.
72694|1|Fascinating mix of comedy, gender bending, feminism and fantasy.
53745|1|A solid thriller with a great cast that tends to suffer from some faults...
41472|0|Though the script is remarkably faithful to Jennifer Egan's novel, it relies too heavily on voice-over to move the plot along, preferring to baldly inform the audience of developments than letting us figure them out for ourselves.
42873|0|It's rumored the actors were paid for this. You don't need to.
54196|1|That the film can still move us despite its imperfections is part of its accomplishment.
69580|0|Good comedy is derived from the characters, but this film doesn't establish its characters well enough to be effective on that level.
66824|0|Girls Will Be Girls is gross-out camp, much like the movies of John Waters.
30110|1|The film lacks the exotic, colourful flamboyance of the best of its successors. So shoot me.
52913|1|Offers a fresh twist on winning out and gives us pause to think about our way of being in the world
96825|0|The credits state that Martian Child stars John Cusack, Amanda Peet and Joan Cusack, but really, it stars Lucky Charms, M&M's and Amazon.com.
4981|0|A one-joke movie, stretched to the limit.
37095|1|Varda transforms the typical French cinema gamine into a complex, tragic figure: the girl who's all too good at playing plaything, forced to face the hollowness of her youth.
4305|1|Demonstrates how even highly gifted people can bring themselves down
22523|0|Where can a movie like this go except straight into a brick wall?
20763|1|...a passionate movie about passionate people in passionate times.
31230|0|Mostly a hodgepodge of stale show-biz stereotypes mixed with the brand of schmaltzy emotionalism that can be bought off the rack of any store on Rodeo Drive.
43075|1|A worthy companion to Traffic, which isn't all it's cracked up to be, either.
58120|0|it's got all the warmth and charm of the Bataan Death March
46081|0|The human actors are secondary, for the real star of the show is Number 5. He's really pretty charming, though his unusual antics aren't enough to carry a feature-length motion picture.
41233|1|This charming musical based on the comic strip character Little Orphan Annie features many memorable songs and pleasant dance numbers.
97912|1|Clearly, such material appeals primarily to teenage fanboys, but del Toro's dark humour broadens its scope.
71922|1|Mr. Matthau is so good playing old men, we may never know when he finally becomes one.
101153|1|It's a mammoth shame that this film has slipped down the back of the sofa of movie history.
24775|0|So slavishly formulaic, so deprived of an any inspiration of any kind, that it very well could have been written by a monkey.
33927|1|A well-crafted concert film that should delight fans and attract new ones.
79832|1|... an accumulation of minor touches, little dissonances, imaginative observations, and pieces of creative business: hundreds of details that erupt with lives of their own but fit together like a clockwork mechanism with a human heartbeat.
43208|1|Oh, such fun for older teens!
92744|1|Made with formidable assurance, a compelling look, quiet skill and impressive economy.
83089|0|Keeps a smile on your face even though there are only a couple of actual laughs along the way.
53104|1|It's not going to be everyone's bag of popcorn, but it definitely gives you something to chew on.
58742|1|Engaging.
24184|1|A Swiftian satire on white yuppies -- it's American Psycho with five psychos.
34607|1|As expected, Fozzie the Bear and the old geezers Statler and Waldorf receive the lion's share of the choice lines.
12733|1|It's consistently fleet and funny, even as it probes the heady abandon and looming hangover that typified the decade of discontent.
49410|0|Basically a low-rent remake of the 1984 low-rent teenage sex comedy Hot Dog ... The Movie.
90187|0|When 'Stoned' veers away from the known facts of the Stones' story ... it [slows]. For anyone less than obsessed with such Stones arcana, it's hard to imagine how it could matter at all.
60776|1|It may be off beam in its philosophy, but its quality of humor is not strained.
54064|1|Stanwyck's metamorphosis from indolence to hysteria is brilliantly executed.
28907|1|Bouquet and Auteuil inhabit their characters believably and turn in resonant performances.
69399|1|Burton, favoring form over content, flavor over fact, has been often criticized for not knowing how to bring his work to satisfactory resolution. But I'd call that a good thing. Blame it on his dad.
5471|0|A bummer.
68315|1|[William] Friedkin creates a jittery atmosphere of adrenaline and corruption and danger...
20404|1|The movie, a heady thicket of political intrigue and double crosses, is slower, talkier, and more prosaic than the first two films, and its narrative seams sometimes show. And yet it's more than the sum of its mazelike convolutions.
44877|1|"The whole film plays a great deal like an extended episode of ""Iron Chef"": lots of edged weapons, dead frogs, and campy dialogue."
26545|0|SLC Punk cannot quite reach the richer depths it grasps for, because it doesn't have the material to support the large dramatic distance Stevo has to travel.
82671|1|A powerful dark tale that is emotional and profound in its unsentimental characterization of lowly underworld figures.
32291|0|Sadly, Kirk Douglas' real-life stroke is the most compelling ingredient in Miramax's new cobbled-together caper flick.
67347|0|...without a single glimpse into what makes Esther tick, it's impossible to feel a single thing towards her except apathy.
90129|1|Gore gets admirable points for using intelligence in his arguments rather than fear
43793|0|If you're going to make a serious tearjerker, somebody's got to die. It's in the handbook of romantic platitudes.
68659|1|Directorially, production is John Ford in peak form, sustaining interest and suspense throughout, and presenting exceptional characterizations. Picture is a display of photographic grandeur.
26484|0|Once the thud of its wooden dialogue has settled into a deadly mechanical clomp -- about 10 minutes into the film -- you wonder why this risible movie didn't go straight to video.
12035|1|"It may be legend, and it may be romanticized, but ""Lawrence of Arabia"" feels authentic. It's as stirring an epic as Hollywood has ever produced-one reason why the American Film Institute has named it the Number 1 epic of all time."
62240|1|The two chief pleasures of High Society are the performances, which bring life and vitality to the characters, and the music, which makes this the kind of movie that never loses its appeal.
2326|1|"[VIDEO ESSAY] ""Strange Days"" owes a debt to Michael Powell's ""Peeping Tom,"" the film that ruined his storied career."
29577|1|[Blu-ray Review] Worth a look, but creatively falls victim to a series that slowly declined with each new entry.
89814|0|Great music and costumes, but with a woeful plot and jaw-droppingly stilted dialogue. Cuban-born Garcia's main complaint against Fidel seems to be that rich, corrupt Cubans could no longer dance the night away.
28675|0|An unnecessarily-long thriller that contains far more talking than action.
48327|1|A highly enjoyable thriller.
79802|1|It's a study of human weakness and cruelty, it's a portrait of Christ the suffering servant, it's the heartbreaking story of a young girl's descent from innocence to despair. But above all, it's a movie about a donkey.
72296|0|Yawn.
66926|0|The impression left is that one can turn a serial-killer movie into a pretentious art-house film, but why would you want to?
89944|0|There are more farts and embarrassing sex jokes than laughs -- far more.
42101|0|Joffe's extravaganza is a hollow, if pretty, shell.
41884|0|No, it wasn't.
37936|1|The distillate of Lubitsch's cinema of insinuation and evanescence
35615|0|This all would have been perfect for a half-hour TV show or one of those horror anthology films. As it is, even the resourceful Reiner and Goldman are hard put to keep things going until the inevitable final clash.
74833|1|Escape from Alcatraz is relentless in establishing a mood and pace of unrelieved tension.
75566|1|I'll Sleep When I'm Dead deftly traces the sad, steady pulse just under the skin of things . . . the lingering images etching out their own fitting epitaph.
54660|1|Good music, creative twists and a moving performance by freaky Christopher Walken saved this potentially stinky kiddie film
63664|1|"In a summer full of ""summer movies,"" I Capture the Castle is a fortress reminding you what is most real and important in life is within."
99371|1|Delicately handled and handsomely made.
92325|1|Por alguns instantes, o filme parece ter algo relevante a dizer sobre a desumanização provocada pela guerra ou o niilismo de uma geração entediada e descrente, mas constatamos que quer apenas chocar, desperdiçando as ótimas atuações de Bale e Rodriguez.
62048|1|Ghobadi's witty dialogue successfully balances pathos and humor in palatable fashion
17452|0|"Abrasively loud, gratingly acted, appallingly directed and without a moral core, this ""3 Ninjas"" also boasts a screenplay with the most ""Unhhhs"" of the decade, that exquisite sound you make when trying to anihilate another human with your foot or a karate"
15800|1|...an affable (yet somewhat forgettable) bit of escapist entertainment.
38850|1|The story of Sleepaway Camp is pretty much everything you'd expect from a slasher movie and nothing you'd ever expect, which is what makes Hiltzik's campy and disturbing summer camp tale still one of the more memorable horror movies ever made.
22837|1|By themselves, Chan and Tucker do not provide anything inspiring or refreshing, but when they are combined, they form a surprisingly entertaining comedic duo.
2195|0|Writer/director Chris Columbus delivers his usual slapstick and sap shtick, but the sitcom-slick results fall flat.
69222|1|The Brothers get to perform some of their most irresistible routines.
12972|1|MacDowell was never more convincing and Chris Elliott is a dry delight as her lens-man. Murray and movie, meanwhile, are a mutual godsend: Groundhog Day rescued his career from calcifying in self-caricature.
7587|0|Sporadically funny, but never more than a sting of crude gags.
84281|0|Michael Haussman's over-directed conspiracy thriller takes place in a small desert town in New Mexico and recalls a bad episode of The X-Files.
9203|1|The whole thing is really a condensed summer holiday, all hot sun and suavity.
7499|0|Baldwin is shockingly uninteresting, walking through this role... or should I say sweating, for Dave is covered in perspiration in practically every scene.
90264|0|The cast just about escapes with its dignity after this derivative, predictable urban thriller.
21090|1|Although film is a bit uneven, production benefits from a tasty look, an airy tone, and a delectable, unblemished performance from Hannah.
91649|0|Depp's performance overcomes every flaw in the film. He ends up playing Dillinger exactly as he should be--suave, mysterious, romantic, but with obvious elements of cruelty and unbridled violence.
82627|0|Obviously intended to be a bright and breezy romantic-comedy thriller, it ends up a mangy old mutt of a movie thanks to a charmless script and disastrous casting decisions.
3588|1|An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well!
10239|1|Both grimly funny and thought-provoking.
88264|1|Wayne Wang keeps things on an even keel, with good supporting performances from LL Cool J as Latifah's romantic interest, Timothy Hutton as a corporate villain and Alicia Witt as Hutton's secretary/mistress.
94548|0|Zach Braff brings what he always does -- a basic mopey charm, some sarcasm, even a rudimentary self-awareness.
22635|1|Without a shadow of a doubt the most rewarding, funny, and likable romance of the last twenty years. It heralds the decency of romantic love against the gears of a cold, grinding mechanical world.
23277|1|Mournful and moving, eerie and uncompromising.
65714|0|Try as it might to hold our attention, it disappoints at every turn, ending in a whimper rather than a bang.
95086|1|In Search of a Midnight Kiss is a surprising charmer, a wandering modern romantic comedy with enough bittersweet aftertaste to give it substance and enough wit to keep you entertained.
96713|0|Garlin's clearly inspired by his own experiences living as someone who's fat and funny, but being honest isn't the same thing as being perceptive.
56012|1|If it weren't for the likeability of Jackie Chan and his inventive, acrobatic, larger than life and entertaining martial arts prowess, a film like The Tuxedo would be a minor disaster.
12443|1|Directed by Soviet filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky with the same unearthly visual style, and the same mingled concern with technology and psychology, that he showed in his towering 'Solaris' a few years ago.
31718|1|Lubitsch demonstrates that romantic comedies, like popcorn, can be enjoyed salty as well as sweet.
50559|0|"Walter Hill, who also directed the first film, surely recognizes the hollowness of what he's doing here. He also hasn't had a hit since ""48 HRS.,"" which no doubt explains why he's once again tilling these charred fields."
7586|0|The blockbuster action thriller genre is ripe for sending up, but this lazy effort has to go down as a miss despite the presence of spoofmeister Leslie Nielsen.
81613|1|Vital and delirious, The Saddest Music in the World hurtles along on twin tracks of vaudevillian humor and gleeful bad taste.
23707|1|Riveting and repulsive, with a claustrophobic perspective that mirrors its subjects: all id, all in the moment. But it's also shallow, all on the surface.
2615|1|It soars because of the sizzling chemistry of Douglas and Demi Moore.
19550|1|This tension between the permissible and the forbidden, between exterior and interior, between the illusion of freedom and captivity, between light and darkness becomes the organizing principle of Bertolucci's spectacular epic.
43712|0|Needlessly corny...a manipulative melodrama that wastes the presence of a fine actress such as Bates...Furlong's brooding becomes rather tedious in Bill's drowsy dud
52661|1|As a salon full of characters, Impromptu provides great fly on the wall fun.
20247|1|Fttingly the one installment in the trilogy that most resembles an old-fashioned movie, from its lovingly evoked western setting to its charmingly sentimental mood.
68981|1|Yes, it is lowbrow and sophomoric. What you'd call dumb-de-dumb-dumb fun.
1737|0|Takes two giant steps backward.
54694|1|A real step forward for the digital video revolution.
60372|0|It's disreputable, occasionally ludicrous and merely kinda fun.
16065|0|Dreadful attempt at romantic comedy
4644|0|There's virtuosity here but no magic.
50828|1|If its bite and sass have diminished for today's new audiences ... consider that a testimony to the attitude, style, and technique it pioneered and infused into American popular movies.
23070|0|If Blair Witch Project's hand-held camera work made you feel sick, this one will have you throwing up in your popcorn.
1003|1|In the title role, Van Ammelrooy provides a strong center to the rambling story, both feminine and authoritative.
22185|0|Only for Van Damme's die-hard fans
99810|0|Wahlberg is atrocious, as wooden as the trees terrorising him.
3395|1|...Redford manages to build quite a snowball of drama in all of this, full of heroes and antiheroes...
69968|1|Arguably, this is Preminger's masterpiece.
33002|0|Extremely prolific and generally untalented, Jess Franco is the Spanish Ed Wood, albeit without Wood's gift for humorously inane dialogue.
37000|1|Based upon a potboiling bestseller novel, Frankenheimer brings an artistic sense to the film, but he can only take it so far.
8665|1|A big beautiful film! You can watch it 1000 times and still giggle!
96782|0|Elite Squad is a relentlessly ugly, unpleasant, often incoherent assault on the senses from Brazil.
43573|1|A measured yet deeply enthralling character study of loss and loyalty.
15968|1|Sure, the movie follows a basic romantic comedy formula, but it has a freshness about it, mainly because Aniston and Mohr make a sweet match.
80492|0|Very little seems to happen in this social vacuum, and none of it is memorable.
28009|1|...the point at which Kubrick's black humor crosses over into blatant parody.
84977|0|Compared to the flashier Superman, the dark knight was always more human and prone to brooding, but this film is way out of whack.

72631|0|Earnest but misguided biopic
69270|1|Another winner from the greatest surfer of the French New Wave.

52769|0|Violent and ultimately uneven and unsatisfying.
29089|1|Nifty little thriller.
44772|1|A sort of wandering rom-com epic -- kicking romantic fallacies in the ribs while capturing something essential about the solipsism and dreams of young urbanites.
27018|0|Super disappointment w/Pryor comedy emphasis a cosmic mistake
45053|1|The movie does not offer a clean-cut look at morality and heroes, who emerge from a reluctant position, but it does draw a definitive line between good and evil.
47260|1|This late masterpiece (1962) by Howard Hawks transcends every literary value in the book to become a brilliantly entertaining and insightful work of pure cinema.
38432|1|You'll probably think in a new way about the sounds and the music, the look of places and people, how much or little you take note of the scents and sensations of daily life.
22036|0|a minor work in Hitchcock's canon
62593|1|An upstart's precocious proposal on artistry, independence, and the business of family, or vice-versa
11635|1|Not for the weak of heart or the closed of mind.
710|0|It is so focused on its own boldness, its dare-to-shock sensuality (the film got an NC-17 from the MPAA, but is being released unrated), that nothing else comes through.
39089|1|One of the funniest movies starring a multiple murderer.
99919|0|...a manufactured piece of work that's been geared towards the lowest common denominator.
47334|1|A chilling picture of coming global crisis fuelled by our lack of fuel.
301|1|As a whole, Four Rooms is only diverting, and pretty mindless, but at its best it's a lot of fun.
89841|0|The film was directed by Mary Harron from a screenplay she wrote with Guinevere Turner. In the past, these two did substantial work. Now they play, so that audiences may have the double pleasure of enjoying their porn while feeling superior to it.
71672|1|...a fascinating, if frustrating, look at the relative lack of power and security and place a child has in our modern world.
15963|0|Dull but harmless.
47391|1|Silly western revisits Jesse James.
17705|1|[Ferrara] works unapologetically in B-movie territory, but does it with A-movie style.
33043|1|A big, over-the-top comedy, with a sense of humor probably best appreciated by misanthropic nihilists.
76038|0|This isn't one of [Keaton's] best, despite some amusing scenes.
14573|0|This British drama gets increasingly lurid as it goes. And its handling of risque material is sensationalistic, even exploitative.
589|1|"Significant as both history and film art, this gloomy tale has no ""convenient"" villains and refuses to indulge in stereotypes, instead focusing on larger forces, such as racism and political apathy."

27401|1|A splendid, eye-filling adventure that harkens back in many ways to the 1967 animated version of The Jungle Book.
36214|1|In the desolate surrounds of a prison environment that affronts humanity McQueen finds the redemptive struggles, and unrelenting spirit in the feces smeared walls of a British prison.
1846|0|Watch the opening for Bruce Campbell's death scene, and then run far away.
54695|1|Tadpole has more than its share of problems, true, but they are problems that can be borne.
22779|0|You're kidding right? A truly embarrassing spectacle deracinated of the novel's interesting political questions.
20400|1|This hits have gotten bigger, and the violence has gotten bloodier. It's less of an examination of family and more of a character piece for Michael.
11634|1|This is a bitter pill, and it is difficult to swallow.
7571|1|A fairly entrancing vision of a human race overrun by evolving artificial intelligence.
73916|1|An orgasmic mix of on-road mayhem that plays at 1000 miles per hour! Marvel in some terrifically-choreographed stunt
54223|0|Arnold has his place on the small screen, but here his attempts to save his neighbourhood from corporate takeover seem overextended.
96377|1|"Arguably Wes Anderson's most compassionate, mature film, ""Darjeeling"" dances around disconcerting what-ifs: If they weren't your brothers and sisters, would you voluntarily befriend them, or do you tolerate quirks and annoyances because blood links you?"
3802|1|Hallstrom finds the right bittersweet tone for his dysfunctional family tale (and one of Hollywood's few films about obesity), marvelously acted by Johnny Depp and particularly Leonardo DiCaprio in his second outing as a retarded adolescent.
93913|0|Pretty much a run-of-the-mill carbon copy of Rain Man.
79765|1|They don't make movies or movie directors like this anymore.

324|0|Goes nowhere fast.
43901|1|Honest, suspenseful and educational.
15829|0|When it's good, it's very good. And when it's not, it can be as silly and self-important as a bad '50s sci-fi movie.

44419|1|Okay thriller.
63231|0|About as funny as root canal work and as romantic as a rainy fortnight in Wrexham. Rob Reiner should make a phone call to Christopher Guest a priority.

16272|1|An egotistical Austrian undergoes a spiritual transformation through his contact with Tibetan Buddhists.
98813|0|Feverish yet bizarrely apolitical, the movie tries to have it both ways and fumbles its outraged and reconciliatory impulses equally
32864|1|The flaws of this acutely self-conscious 1970 road picture grow more obvious with every passing year, but so does its passion and eloquence.
33234|1|It is one of the most visually hypnotic films ever -- and that's not hyperbole.
73404|1|One of the best westerns of the 70s, if not all time.
38851|1|The justly-famous closing image is one of the most baffling and incongruous climaxes in a genre known and celebrated by devotees for its WTF factor.
64598|0|The result is without dramatic or moral weight, despite Highway's contrived comeuppance, and it's impossible to care about the characters.
13425|1|Despite an intelliegnt performance by Ben Kingsley in the lead, Attenborousgh's worthy biopic is too conventional in illuminating the venerable leader.
38561|0|Annoying movie that wastes a talented cast.
1615|0|Pandas are many things. Adorable fuzzballs. Voracious eaters. Vanishing species. But, as actors, they are black and white and dull all over, which The Amazing Panda Adventure demonstrates all too well.
98040|0|Easily Lawrence's best starring role. But keep in mind that's only compared to his other movies.

32347|1|Intense, mature version of The King and I.
53180|1|Love, in Godard's case, is indistinguishable from cinema and thus he sees the growing capitalist machine as a threat to both.

35407|1|The classic tragedy, in classic form.
20855|1|Blue Velvet is a throughly unpredictable, frequently disturbing and sometimes jaw-droppingly funny film. There isn't anything else quite like it, and it's pretty wonderful.
39651|0|A leaden, but not especially wretched example of early-'90s body horror...As the third Hellraiser, though, Hell on Earth is beyond worthless.
81492|1|With Samurai, faced at 71 with what may have been the most challenging project of his career, [Yamada] blossomed like a gnarled cherry tree exploding in flowers on the last day of spring.
40338|1|The lead characters are extremely well played by Laura Linney and Mark Ruffalo. Yet above all it is Kenneth Lonergan's writing and direction that left the biggest mark.
9019|1|Gloria Swanson and William Holden give definitive, Oscar-nominated performances as the fading star and hack writer, respectively, in Bily Wilder's darker than dark comedy about the inner workings of Hollywood at a crucial phase of the industry's change.

84545|1|Squeaks by on the top-notch comedy quotient.

46621|1|De Jarnatt does a superb job of cultivating a vibe of bleak, apocalyptic hopelessness...
6074|1|What Bobby Fischer took away, dashing the hopes and the innocence of his acolytes when he spurned chess, may never truly be recaptured. But some of it has found its way to the screen.
88127|1|Malick manages to do something I never thought possible, and that's make America seem like a New World to begin with.
46736|1|It isn't a perfect film, but it's never less than strikingly original.
13798|1|An exercise in high style that even the most unredeemably rational among moviegoers should find enormously enjoyable.
86988|0|Dave Spritz is a shallow creation, one that even an actor of Cage's talents cannot bring to three dimensional life. The problem gets worse: we wouldn't much care for him even if he were real.
82562|1|...the film at once seems like a visually dynamic conflation of a Robert Flaherty film and a proto-neorealist fable comprised of photogenic locals and working class heroics.
17|1|There's no denying 3D adds extra texture to Pixar's seminal 1995 buddy movie, emphasising Buzz and Woody's toy's-eye- view of the world.

83730|1|Apted gives this smarter-than-average script a slick look and expertly develops suspense.
94536|0|Shannon, a born comic sidekick, cannot carry the central role; disappointingly, the story sputters out into a sentimental finale.
54874|0|Individual sequences generate an eerie tension that's always deflated, creating a jarring stop-and-go rhythm, and the atmospheric trickery never strays beyond a lot of smoke and mirrors.
69753|1|There are mysteries to be explored in [Ceylan's] compositions: Why are so many people so far from the camera? Why is that floor creaking? Where did that bright red basket, suddenly lowered onto a dingy street, come from?
69739|1|A startlingly quiet film that is buoyed by a droll humor, splendid visuals and bittersweet reflections into the human condition.
85287|0|Why would such a talent as Martin Lawrence make a totally useless, inane movie? I'm guessing that, as usual, money talks.
26854|1|Jet Li is freakin' unstoppable!
97953|1|Imperfect though it may be, In Bruges has charms that are difficult to resist, much like the city for which it's named.
71425|1|A production which would rather scare its audience with gore than reel it in via a gripping whodunit.
1329|0|If anything, Rumble in the Bronx is a good example of a foreign film trying to look American and failing miserably.
55192|0|The movie version is like a bedtime story -- pleasant but a little soporific.
1336|1|A strained but nevertheless involving little personal drama about a delinquent's alleged murderous deed. Schroeder's suspense piece is arbitrary but satisfying thanks to the reliable leads.
67385|1|it's the closest we're gonna get to the golden age when Mel Blanc did the voices and the cartoons were directed by Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng and Robert McKimson
26963|1|Mommie Dearest features an intense and bold performance by Faye Dunaway as Joan Crawford.

79684|1|Interesting as a claustrophobic vision.
94184|1|A very impressive feature debut with this brutal western revenge thriller.
7433|1|The gung-ho corniness, colorful characters, and unflinching bad-ass attitude are just so damn entertaining, and Hill is never apologetic...
55658|0|Action is relatively mild for the genre and, unfortunately, so are the jokes.
26552|0|Spade serves as both star and co-writer of this lame, crass romantic comedy. Most of the jokes he's written fall flat, and his delivery isn't much better.
14794|0|[Chechik] has crafted Benny & Joon not as a seamless whole but as a tumble of scenes. Unfortunately, too many of them are inspired by Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd or Buster Keaton, and they seem to spill from the screen like Bozos from a kiddie car.
57839|1|Marshall puts a suspenseful spin on standard horror flick formula.
72267|1|Andre Techine, maestro of the French New Wave directors, tells a seductively simple story of survival set on the outskirts of German occupied Paris in June of 1940.
53173|1|Despite its lack of perspective on history or the evolution of the sport, Dogtown and Z-Boys does what documentaries do best: It makes even viewers who have never touched a skateboard feel a part of the action.
17565|1|The John Woo school of the ballet of bullets gets a full dose of Sam Peckinpah under the steady hand of director Antoine Fuqua's finely framed tale of revenge.
39290|0|Kate complains about being an immortal, grousing about 'the endless, numbing sameness of it all.' I know how she feels.
50829|1|handsomely mounted period piece, but can't shake off a certain air of good manners
82570|1|A delicate charmer, sometimes precious, but nonetheless fine.
10880|0|"The exaggerated raw violence of ""Reservoir Dogs"" leaves one feeling cheated in the end. For this movie isn't really about anything. It's just a flashy, stylistically daring exercise in cinematic mayhem."
92359|1|Ultimately, Fast Food Nation is preaching to the converted.
60985|1|It's so good to have friends -- regardless of how little they may be.
60723|0|Inundated with trip-cam trickery that (rides) the ups and downs of the main character's drug buzzes, the film is nothing if not stylish, but falls short for lack of depth.
78850|0|Mostly forgettable story that employs a relative of the original transparent dude. Yes, taking the potion can make you insane. Been there, done that.
36535|1|The film that launched the French New Wave, Breathless remains an outstanding testament to the great ideals of fun filmmaking that infused the movement.
66319|1|Every scene drives home its point, plainly, that man's inhumanity to man is incurable.
84067|1|Dirty, sweaty and thrilling.
10089|0|It's a slick and sassy attempt to get mileage from a dependable vehicle by wrapping it in as many sure-fire gimmicks as the filmmakers can cram onto the screen.
67904|1|An extremely underrated film. Well worth watching, again and again.
16682|1|A great showcase for the actor's skills.
17772|1|I'm an explorer myself, but take my advice, if you have any aspirations of seeing Everest - do it in a movie theater.
21443|0|Chris sets off on a rescue mission, and ends up running the gauntlet of big city perils in a belaboured spinning-out of a weak storyline.
23782|0|It has all the right moves. It knows all the right words. Its characters have all the right clothes, expressions, fears, lusts and ambitions. But there's no payoff and it doesn't lead anywhere.
49089|1|A brilliant and truly incredible piece of art that deserves to be watched...
83265|0|I'm all for anime getting wider release here domestically, but not if it's top heavy with the Explodo and half-baked philosophy.
31170|1|As a satire on the internecine savagery of fiscal doings under late Reaganite capitalism, the movie is not as biting as it thinks it is; but it's still the best hoot since Arthur.
42978|1|A modest, non-pushy little movie, one that resists hitting you over the head to get laughs.
74188|1|Rich, strange and gorgeous, F.W. Murnau's Sunrise shows what an artist of the late silent era could accomplish cinematically, backed by an open checkbook and fueled by the highest aspirations even in the simplest of morality tales.
69596|1|Excellent but upsetting, only for older teens.
24716|1|The birth of slapstick.
66225|1|Not the sextet's finest effort, but still drop-dead funny.
62015|1|The truest depiction I have ever seen on film of how children grow up with divorced parents. Hollywood blockbuster hype notwithstanding, this is actually the must-see movie of the summer.
100156|0|That faint thumping noise you hear is Russ Meyer doing donuts in his grave.
83416|1|Intends to let the world know something about the Kurdish people and their suffering.

71706|1|A showcase for three very talented actresses.
73701|0|No one but Tennessee Williams could have concocted it, but anyone other than John Huston should have directed it.
99758|1|Although familiarity with Italian politics helps in appreciating this film, anyone can enjoy this energetic tale of a house divided.
33214|1|Broadway-like funny romantic comedy sitcom about struggling Manhattan actors, that has its awkward moments.
99004|0|While not without its funny moments, this labored sequel ups the nudity and gross-out factor while diminishing the sweetness and evident camaraderie of its appealing leads.
49693|0|Gimmicky sci-fi, outer space B-flick.
92995|0|The problem with this film is that it's not bad enough.
79152|1|In Letters, the glossy romanticism of history crumbles before our very eyes.
46437|1|Dennis Quaid actually manages to make Jerry Lee Lewis likeable.
44288|1|Nudity and excessive exposition accompany gore-infused visual f/x in this splashy modern Goth extravaganza.
66186|0|Dreary suburban thriller.
81972|0|Well, this particular fantasy surely lost its novelty value a while back, and frankly never did much for me anyhow.
37863|1|The love of learning is tops in classic law school tale.
9502|1|Mildly amusing Jackie Chan adventure.
75325|0|It's so ho-hum, it's hard to stay awake through it. And the title? One of the Mackay kids eats the daisies at the new house. Somehow, in the book that seemed a lot funnier.
15245|0|It's cheesy-looking and convoluted and has as much character as a bus tire.
1987|0|I've never seen a film -- whether it was based on a book, a play, or in this case a timeless legend -- treat its source material with such cavalier disregard.
16638|1|Unpleasant to view but ultimately satisfying.
61269|0|One more nail in Reynolds' cinematic coffin
9424|1|This ambitious adaptation of the Edna Ferber novel is often touched by greatness, yet it's ultimately too scattershot to satisfactorily maintain its bloated 200-minute running time.
6884|0|Just a slightly amusing timepasser.
62001|1|Bigger and badder than No. 1, but still a blast.
32103|1|Sigourney Weaver dominates with her powerful performance but the film, a feature debut from theater director Scott Elliott, is so poorly conceived and staged that much of the emotional impact gets lost
43027|1|Brosnan... completely alters the tone of the movie with every scene he's in, bringing a level of smarminess that makes it far more interesting than just a bureaucratic spy thriller
101501|0|At its simplest, it's a gorgeous film with beautiful period costumes and intricate set designs. However, something tells me that's not the level director Saul Dibb wanted to achieve greatest on.
74266|0|So much of this Danish-Swedish import is so uninteresting that it quickly becomes a chore to sit through. And that's too bad, because the film has a lot to say about professional- vs.-personal life struggles.
11247|1|A fine, trenchant political documentary on a par with The War Room
34151|1|Smart, engaging, and weirdly cool, Ghost Dog defies easy pigeonholing in favor of a complexity all its own.
7136|0|Space Jam is harmless kiddie fare, but it may not be every adult's idea of a good time.
13998|0|In this formulaic star vehicle, Schwarzenegger gets to fly like Peter Pan, act like Superman--and fulfill all the fantasies kids may have about their fathers.
75104|1|Somehow it can't make the leap from an enjoyable light film to a movie to remember.
1438|1|Avoiding the safety of the PC blanket, David O. Russell has crafted a canny, crafty and altogether adorable little misfit of a movie.
83969|0|too much of a one-note concept to make the entertainment value lift much above lake level
77329|0|If you're looking for a long, solid laugh, Highwaymen will do the trick.
36956|1|Monsieur Verdoux can boast a screenplay with a highly unusual moral complexity and a deeply philosophical bent...Yes, Verdoux is a film that name-drops Schopenhauer, but it's also damn funny... [Blu-ray]
68074|1|Director Alan J. Pakula, who cowrote the script with Frank Pierson, has done a reasonable job of compressing Turow's plot into a two-hour space. But the narrative skeleton is all that's left.
87120|1|If only every women's movie had Nine Lives' fire, intelligence, and conviction, they wouldn't have such a shaky reputation in the first place.
77161|0|Monotonous.
78035|1|Dylan Kidd is back with an intimate and endearing love story featuring some exceptional performances and solid writing.**
71321|1|This enthralling documentary ... is at once playful and haunting, an in-depth portrait of an iconoclastic artist who was fundamentally unknowable even to his closest friends.
52722|1|The incessant comic relief, clumsy and cumbersome, too often gets in the way of a cracking good tale.
94462|0|...Scott Wiper's hopelessly inept directorial choices - coupled with an overall vibe of ugliness - ensures that the movie ultimately fares about as well as its straight-to-video action brethren...
85571|0|Stealth offers a plot so laughably preposterous that you halfway expect instructions to flash on the screen with a point tally in the corner.
87864|1|Lapses in judgement occasionally jar -- like the habit of playing middle of the road ballads over key scenes -- but the central romance is touching enough to lock us in while bringing out the moral of this story.
10585|1|This is reportedly the last time producer/writer George Lucas and director Steven Spielberg will treat movie fans to an Indiana Jones adventure, and it's pretty obvious they were determined to send Indy riding off into the sunset in style.

63036|1|Journalistic scandal story best for older teens.
24689|0|The clumsily loaded characterisation not only treats almost every other figure as dispensable, but doesn't even bother to make Meg and Tom properly sympathetic.
61983|1|Duff is a charming heroine who carries the movie cheerfully, if not gracefully-the pratfalls come early and often.
66793|0|There's no disguising the fact that, beneath all its talk, this is a very traditional, very predictable romance; it's sorely in need of some comic relief.
102058|1|I watched Hiroshi Teshigahara's The Face of Another and read about it and thought about it, yet ultimately failed to connect with it.
51239|1|Some of Pryor's greatest late-heyday stand-up.
59378|1|All 87 minutes of the film consists of interviews, with no inclination to stage it beyond the words acting as reveals of insightful new information.
70522|0|It sounds like a marvelous idea... until you actually watch the movie.
81755|0|Nothing about The Interpreter strikes us as very original.
56869|1|Despite good intentions, this uneven drama might disturb women as the journalist played by Sally Field is not only irresponsible but also not very bright; Paul Newman compensates with a strong turn.

34926|1|There's an undeniable thrill when Bronson blows away some sleazy mugger.
53925|0|Is this really the sort of entertainment America wants?
94243|0|A big cheat because virtually nothing of what happens in the first 100 minutes would ever really have happened if the truth that's exposed in the final few minutes was true.
26996|1|Acaba sendo salvo pelo mesmo elemento que contribuiu para o sucesso do original: a dinâmica e a química entre Christopher Reeve e Margot Kidder.

11420|1|Liam Neeson somehow knits Kinsey's qualities together in a likeable human pattern.

25788|0|Christine shows us what great filmmakers can do with flawed material, and how even their greatness can't solve every problem.
81566|1|The film's moments of whimsy and its wry comic insights into one man's Prufrockian drifting and yearning through life add up to a charming oddity.

80829|1|Armand Assante gives the most robust and impressive performance of his career as Cesar, a musician whose lust for life affects all those around him.
62181|1|The director wisely resists the temptation to treat slackerdom as just a blase counterpoint to the craziness of the world.
56606|0|"With an unusual protagonist (a kilt-wearing Jackson) and subject matter, the improbable ""Formula 51"" is somewhat entertaining, but it could have been much stronger."
73968|0|Your opinion of this tale of a troubled country superstar will depend totally on your reaction to George Strait. There's no denying he's handy with a tune, but dialogue proves more difficult for him.
2376|0|A forgettable sequel to Seagal's best movie.
45508|1|There is much to see on this journey, all of it presented in the abundant, deep-focus detail that is Gilliam's visual trademark.
2739|1|Typically, Burton's storytelling is sometimes erratic, but his emphasis on humanizing marginal characters -- a project that seems central to his artistic agenda -- is as strong as ever.
70119|1|The structure and character sense of the David Goodis novel are intact, and a full-throttle supporting cast has a ball with meaty parts.
13380|1|The film creates a perfect embodiment of every adolescent's nightmare.
69477|1|... the thrilleresque aspects ... are most pleasing.
11715|1|For all its chilly symmetry and beauty, the sheer injustice shown will have your pulse racing.
45528|1|Apartment Zero emerges as a genuinely creepy, disturbing and gripping psychological piece.
6627|1|Director Garry Marshall somehow lucked into a hit despite his oppressive 125-minute running time and excessive schmaltz.
8006|1|A gritty, intense and engaging courtroom drama.
67647|1|While the film hardly works as a dramatic whole, the director's gallop through the horror sub-genres is oddly entertaining, and some of the setpieces are truly inspired.
31804|1|This story of an extramarital fling that turns into a nightmare begins as a well-crafted psychological thriller but degenerates into a misogynistic thrill-fest in its closing moments.
3529|1|A beautifully told faerie tale
68666|1|...a thoughtful ensemble examination of grace (and lack of grace) under stress.
15119|1|Bad title, good movie.
12110|1|a film of sheer visual poetry and deep emotional resonance
56650|1|The saturation bombing of Reggio's images and Glass' evocative music ... ultimately leaves viewers with the task of divining meaning.
36238|1|Decent thriller about purloined diamonds and nazi war criminals. The interrogation scene will make you cringe.
78450|0|Unusually austere and ambiguous.
8982|1|I love Scarlett O'Hara. She's so full of life and energy, it's hard not to be swept up in her personality.
58668|1|It is to Washington's credit that he keeps it just real enough to move our hearts and our heads.
35703|1|The Neil Simon comedy that lit up Broadway for more than two years shines again in this flawed but still funny screen adaptation.
8061|1|Roach has to deal with some pure corn at the end, but he pulls it off and guides the actors to and through far better moments.
40221|0|It's like a third-rate Austin Powers picture cut to the whacking, attention-deficit-disorder tempo of Moulin Rouge.
26823|1|A wonderful, fun film, complete with an unlikely hero willing to take on the world.
83064|1|A moving, subtle and poignant story.
47813|0|Dull and inept. It probably won't offend your sensibilities but it may insult your intelligence.
86563|1|Um noir cujo trágico anti-herói sofre abusos físicos como poucos do gênero, este filme belissimamente fotografado traz, por trás de sua capa sangrenta, uma tocante luta para preservar um único momento de doçura.
22472|1|[Director Vincenzo] Natali's handling of mood and pace leave Cube one of the tightest horror-thrillers of the late '90s.
76133|0|Make no mistake, ivans xtc. is a mess.
97871|0|A few cute gags aside, this is an exercise in stupidity aimed at those who find 15 different names for a bong to be funny.
80550|1|'Are you eating it? Or is it eating you?' I love it!
71714|1|Otar and Lenin make terrific bookends on the post-communist experience for average citizens.
13102|1|Perhaps it's not what you expect from a prison movie, but Jim Jarmusch has always adhered to his own personal vision.
15058|1|You really are immersed into this believable world of the future.
85891|1|In equal measures joyous, bumbling and insecure, Herzlinger deftly captures the man-on-the-street appea.
80794|0|1.5
93587|1|A brave bid to recreate a modern American tragedy, with a revelatory turn by its lead actress.
45948|1|A tense, well-performed erotic thriller....Lowe's at the top of his game
98430|0|Naughty Mike Myers comedy has little to love.
83024|1|The experience is so immediate and immersive that you actually feel as if you are swimming with the krill.
50905|0|Stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed.
10304|1|a performance-driven picture--and what driving.
78980|1|To put it plainly, Sherlock Jr. is my choice for the greatest film ever made.
53636|0|A graceless and miserable film.
30994|1|Essentially, Piranha is the best example of how to do a B-movie knockoff.
45551|0|Unnecessary sequel to now politically incorrect comedy of alcoholism. Great cast, however.
81861|1|A smartly written film that refuses to fall into the traps of the teenage stereotype.
13256|1|A symphony of sound, animation and unbridled Disney spirit.
87561|0|This movie is for die-hard Usher fans only. And by this I mean teen-age girls, who no doubt will enjoy this.
90838|0|nothing new to anybody who's caught five minutes of an episode of The Dukes of Hazzard.
32277|1|"When Larch says, ""Good night, you kings of Maine, you princes of New England,"" the lump raised in the throat is not resented."
56659|0|While the juxtapositions are occasionally intriguing, much of the imagery is so hackneyed ... it feels dead to the eye.
89390|1|A very well-crafted suspense-thriller that unfolds with one dramatically tense scene after another. Hopkins is superb.
75577|1|In the end, it is the complex aura surrounding Owen's character...that stay with the viewer long after the threads of the story have unraveled in one's mind.
4061|1|A seamless, pulsating, dazzlingly visual revenge fantasy that stands as one of the most effective live-actioners ever derived from a comic strip.
73706|0|This adaptation of the Tennessee Williams play is heavy on melodrama and earnest performances, but weak on dialogue and lasting meaning.
63538|1|"... entertains and fully exploits all the accomplishments DreamWorks' animation department has made to this point... ""Sinbad"" stands as an accomplishment all on its own."
19289|1|Special mention, though, should go to Boris Leven's neo-expressionist production design and Daniel L Fapp's forceful cinematography: the crooked angles, pointed shadows and great swashes of red all heighten the mood of rabid fury.
46293|1|It's a funny, horrible story (with black humor of the sort many war correspondents write about), shot mostly in Croatia and nicely paced.
61324|0|A Man Apart is grim, lifeless and, worst of all, as boring as Steven Seagal talking about Buddhism.
59372|1|Amen., a docudrama rather than a documentary, is clearly guided by Shoah's example, asking us to reflect on the Holocaust and what made it possible rather than simply recoil from it.
25123|1|Ultimately, it is a serviceable, well-made thriller that earns its R rating.
91259|1|every bit as ambitious, if never as flawed, as the characters it portrays.
39262|0|The film implies that it's up to something appetizing, but the prevailing vibe is flimsy speechifying.
4020|1|Whoopi's performance makes it watchable.
60023|1|[Smith] and Union bring out the best in each other, especially (and surprisingly) during the more dramatic emotional interludes.
25678|0|I could not get past the pathology lurking just below the skin of this story -- its false morality, its prurient absorption in sexual violence, its sadistic glee over the hero's degradation.
148|1|At the most basic, crowd-pleasing level, Goldeneye does the trick.
85960|1|Mann's direction is immaculate, making Reginald Rose's clearly allegorical, and sometimes forced, screenplay seem even better than it is.
61297|1|A faithful remake, a spirited updating, and a deft, colorful, thoroughly entertaining heist film swimming in character and atmosphere, Neil Jordan's The Good Thief (2002)... may not be his best film, but it is one of his most purely enjoyable.
3722|1|Not bad, but Superman deserved a better sendoff before his paralysis.
13455|0|Good music. Sick imagery.
27403|1|There is not one frame of this film that I would change.
16126|0|A transparent attempt to cash in on the success of TV's Hercules and Xena
71213|0|The racial stereotypes trotted out here suggest the scriptwriters reckon Europe and the world is some kind of long-haul Middle Earth for US audiences.
31159|1|It's all outrageously contrived, and only surprising restraint by director John Landis makes it work. The writing is superb, too, leaving the two funnymen free to do the most inspired textured portrayals either has managed in movies.
7235|0|It's all painfully formulaic.
7487|1|Good, but somehow not great version of the classic British novel.
21628|0|Molly Ringwald is appealing, but the film has little else going for it.
75369|0|It's the Hustler, with Steve McQueen playing stud poker instead of Paul Newman shooting pool.
89094|0|"[Jeuenet] doesn't push it all the way to ""so bad it's good"" territory, but he at least gives a healthy dose of the bizarre that makes it memorable, in its fashion."
96004|1|It's just gunfights strung together, without a whisper of coherence or meaning.
80348|1|At this point, Wilson has his laconic surfer-dude persona down pat, so it's Vaughn who really surprises as the hilariously spastic side of the partnership.
201|0|Slow and unfunny spoof on everyone's favorite bloodsucker.
20576|1|African survival tale not for sensitive animal lovers.
50887|0|A kind of low-rent version of Love Story with overt religious overtones...
30766|1|"An often amusing parody that more closely resembles ""Hogan's Heroes"" than ""Life is Beautiful."""
8499|1|An engaging mixture of bizarre wit and eroticism and heartfelt sadness.
8867|1|"The film's final line is legendary, though I have a soft spot for Jerry's description of a sashaying Sugar: ""Look at that! Look how she moves! That's just like Jell-O on springs!"""
65501|0|This might be a good enough introduction, but hardly the best of the lot.
88270|1|[Latifah] shows both comedic and dramatic range, and garners sympathy despite the script's lack of depth.
12238|1|It's a darkly amusing, manipulative film that's still compelling in its vision of human desperation.
94057|1|A cracking armed-robbery thriller.
45467|1|The emotional complexities unearthed are distinctly adult.
1965|1|You sense that there is so much more at stake here than meets the eye, an extraordinary anger about and fear of 90s purposelessness and predatory intolerance.
59720|0|On its own baby-step terms, and despite its moneyed vanilla-himbo vision of gay masculinity and desire, Making Love plays now as a bemusing anachronism but not an insulting or self-inflating one.
9148|0|While it's now less a case of race than class in black film, Notorious seems to still be taking tabloid cues more from alien ghetto underclass drama and what's come before, rather than bringing new and improved insight to the table beyond the cool music.
46676|1|Decent thriller.
64586|1|It's sweet, likable and even vaguely hip.
43737|1|Masochistic, misogynistic, City of Women is a flamboyant, sophisticated series of set pieces, a boastful apologia pro vita sua.
60432|0|A movie about stealing pricey diamonds rather than strutting around in them, it pits ghetto jewel thieves against martial arts secret agents and high-stakes shopaholics.
66037|1|A profoundly sexist and eminently hummable 1954 CinemaScope musical with some terrific athletic Michael Kidd choreography and some better-than-average direction by Stanley Donen.
93634|1|Next isn't a great movie, but I enjoyed it anyway.
12168|1|Containing less of the blood soaked insanity of the previous two instalments, Army of Darkness comes off as more of an adventure film with a horror element attached to it.
29698|0|Story about the devil's daughter that is poorly written but well acted
100526|0|It was darker and murkier, and I didn't enjoy spending time with the characters, as I had on Friday nights more than ten years ago.
56425|1|Itâ(TM)s comedy with consequence, shenanigans rooted in an ugly reality.
71277|1|It moves at a steady clip, boasting a smart narrative, a few surprising twists, and some respectable action sequences.
90452|0|Clever and undeniably peculiar, Strangers with Candy suffers from both a complete lack of focus and a terminal case of self-satisfaction.
24961|1|A romantic drama with insights into seeing with the heart and not trying to control the other person.
57985|1|Propelled by the actor's acrobatic stunts and groundbreaking special effects, Thief of Bagdad is pure pleasure.
69978|1|A light and fairly innocuous youth picture.
51419|1|Schepisi has never made a better film, and if he never makes one anywhere nearly this good again, this more than justifies the occasional clinker in his filmography.
12075|1|A gilt-edged, no-messing, accept-no-substitutes masterpiece.
86176|1|The truth about this sweet, rather shambling little movie is somewhere between the gush and the criticism.
7012|0|While many films require a suspension of disbelief, August Rush asks viewers to terminate their disbelief without severance and have security escort it from the building.
78317|1|Moralmente complexo, está longe de representar uma experiência 'satisfatória' para o espectador, que sairá emocionalmente esgotado do cinema. Isto o engrandece ainda mais.
38715|0|If you liked (insert any Verhoeven film here) you'll love Hollow Man! I didn't, so I don't.
19193|1|What makes the film so gripping is the brilliance with which Wilder uses John F Seitz's camerawork to range from an unvarnished portrait of New York brutally stripped of all glamour.
101092|1|Surprisingly, Steve Martin created this story. In a decade of wild and crazy fictional terrorism, his was the most horrifyingly plausible - one that spun terrorism as drama into uncomfortable community theater, striking the country's friendliest corners.
42306|1|The Caveman's Valentine is a stylistically bold and bracingly ingenious thriller that grabs your attention, quickens your pulse -- and, when you least expect it, touches your heart.
20159|1|A classic '80s action-fantasy -- tweens will love!
20808|0|Not rich in plausability of plot or character development, but tonally interesting in places.
99174|1|Doug Benson is a funny guy, heartily working his laidback wit and weed-centric material to great effect, cracking up the crowds and endearing himself to the stoner underground.
96955|0|The absence of activists in the streets protesting the war in Iraq continues to confound; the empty seats at theaters showing Lions for Lambs will be somewhat easier to explain.
29511|1|From frame one, the cinematography of Newton Thomas Sigel is also unmistakable. The washed-out look and grainy feel of the picture puts the audience right into the harsh and unmerciful desert heat.
15879|1|Surprisingly pleasant.
32008|0|They don't make thrillers like this any more, and for good reason.
54482|1|My Wife Is an Actress is an utterly charming French comedy that feels so American in sensibility and style it's virtually its own Hollywood remake.
36557|1|The wintry Atlantic City is brilliantly evoked; the firecracker dialogue is a joy, and the final, chaotic denouement is genuinely unexpected.
16684|1|As the center of the drama, Mr. Washington more than fills the screen; he very nearly sets it on fire.
63158|0|The three Twentyman brothers are so good at stealing stuff you wonder why they couldn't have swiped a better heist movie.
44923|1|"What we have here is a hard-core and sometimes condomed ""Thelma and Louise"" with a good dose of Russ Meyer's ""Faster Pussycat Kill Kill"" thrown in."
95283|0|"For his feature directorial debut, screenwriter Jeremy Brock (""Mrs. Brown"") has chosen from a chapter of his own life to tell a story that is as charming and eccentric as it is unsurprising and implausible."
9847|1|A lean and mean exploitation thriller, The Glimmer Man might not be original or memorable, but the goods are delivered with reasonable flair and efficiency.
17578|0|Shows stretch marks from the start.
95320|0|Misses by the size of the Atlantic Ocean in getting to what the Beatles were about.
82001|1|[Shows] less 'the majesty of rock' ... than the banal yet ultimately far more inspirational reality of flawed human beings confronting their demons and getting down to (admittedly big money) business.
59067|0|The King of Comedy fancies itself a scathing social satire about the lust for celebrity carried to extremes. But ultimately, director Martin Scorsese's movie is a severely misconceived and distasteful study of delusional behavior.
37127|1|The story becomes increasingly implausible as its thriller elements kick in, but the moving last shot achieves a sense of spiritual transcendence and grace rare in American movies.
2716|1|The study of social manners and suppressed feelings became Lee's specialty.
39649|1|Against the odds, Barker produced a unique, imaginative, if not somewhat stomach-churning, work that has since earned aplace in the annals of horror cinema.
94918|1|It's breathtaking, heartbreaking, tragic, gorgeous, and true all at the same time.
72668|1|If you're a flamenco fan, this works as a concert film. It's as mere movie that its voice is strained.
8137|0|If it were even half as clever as the promotional web site -- which features such inventions as ROL, a parody of online service AOL -- it would be a small delight. But it's not.
96831|1|John Cusack is perfect but it's Bobby Coleman who delivers one of the most uniquely original kid performances ever. You actually believe he might be from Mars.
76761|1|Remarkably engaging, imaginative, and well crafted.
40195|1|A surprisingly enjoyable kid's movie.
16278|0|Annaud and screenwriter Becky Johnston's view of the Tibetans isn't much more sophisticated than James Hilton's depiction of the inhabitants of Shangri-La in 'Lost Horizon': They're mostly serene mystics...
18279|1|"Kiarostami executes a filmic social study that digs deep into the public and private psyche of Iran's male populace via the age-old query that Shakespeare elegantly distilled into, ""to be or not to be; that is the question."""
51404|1|Delicately handled and superbly textured, this fine adaptation of Graham Swift's Booker Prize-winning novel deals with all the really big subjects: love, friendship, death, life.
17491|0|Denzel Washington has the almost impossible task of holding together a convoluted picture that's only intermittently suspenseful and not very engaging emotionally or intellectually.
61016|1|Episodic but sublime screwball comedy, with Grant and Dunne at their most alluring.
17441|0|Cuarón and company end up throwing all the style they've got at the film... to compensate for a perpetually stalled drama.
21162|1|Narratively, this crazy-grid comedy is slighter than a plate of California cuisine, but what it lacks in solid bulk it more than makes up for in its neon array of oddball cultural colors.
4157|1|A flawed endeavor... but still an entertaining and thought-provoking film.
68351|1|If Betty Blue feasts on the bodies of its leads, it's this director's cut that fully establishes the movie's artistic bona fides.
2368|1|"Improbable as this all sounds, ""Wong Foo"" is a great deal of fun and a small step forward in Hollywood's depiction of homosexuals."
6357|1|Fast, Fun and Fantastically performed....One hot little movie
54475|0|It's the kind of movie that ends up festooning U.S. art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it's in French (well, mostly) with English subtitles and is magically 'significant' because of that.
88304|1|... likeable.
80471|0|Electric Dreams tries to be as up to the minute as the latest rock video. But it looks more like a tired holdover from the ''psychedelic'' 1960s.
36271|1|Takes you on a smart and sassy roller coaster ride.
14295|1|If My Fellow Americans had ever decided which movie it wanted to be, it might have been pretty good. As it is, the good half and the bad half all but cancel each other out.
92538|1|I know, I know, you're thinking, oh please, not Rocky again. I was thinking that too.
34808|1|See website for more details.
93007|1|Lengthy and often off-hot topic, this is still a gripping saga with stand-out turns from Timberlake, Hirsch and kid-in-the-spotlight Yelchin.
33111|1|Keaton at his stonefaced best
2703|1|What makes this a Lee film-and one of his best-is how well he and his co-writers understand all the relationships, and what's going unspoken.
72942|1|"Think of ""The Baxter"" as ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dumped."""
66483|1|Lovely. Even better than the Henry Winkler version.
77998|1|The marionettes run interference with our Hollywood-formula comfort zones -- forcing a fresh look at the hateful stupidity we take for granted every weekend at the multiplex.
26656|0|Folks, he's literally old enough to be her grandfather.
56582|0|The film's final twist is admittedly quite effective, though it doesn't even remotely justify the interminable build-up leading into it.
90710|0|The movie is a long time coming, but the wait for the self-absorbed film to end seems even longer. Maybe the Black Tiger's tears are of frustration.
23103|1|The set design, artistic direction, special effects and cinematography of this film are all stunning.
92483|0|Dracula's daughter herself is strange and memorable,far better than the tawdry B-movie in which she made her first and last appearance.
94939|0|I'm still waiting for animation to go beyond talking animals and simplistic premises with almost take away value. I guess I'll have to sit on the fence with this one...
86108|1|"It took me about 45 minutes into ""Just Like Heaven"" to figure out just exactly what it is: A contemporary retelling of ""Sleeping Beauty."""
4758|1|Young Guns for the ladies. The west never looked so sweet
13362|1|I guarantee you've never seen anything quite like it.
8634|1|Still a sparkling delight.
3452|1|Altman's much-maligned comedy about the fashion industry deserves another look.
55367|0|Blade is often ridiculous, mostly poorly written and, surprisingly poorly acted too.
68751|1|The film is much more interesting for its traces of Davis' own future roles and images than for its decoy status as a GWTW consolation prize.
66972|1|A film many people may be tempted to laugh off as button pushing feel-good fluff. Before doing so, they might want to ask themselves just what it is they find so funny about a little peace, love and understanding.
60790|1|Captures an aura of existential despondence that's married to a far less evocative (and durable) strain of counterculture romantic doom.
48570|1|The director's gift for bare-knuckles lyricism rescues scene after scene.
34129|0|Beyond the Mat wants to blend thrills and pathos, getting at the many sides of what is, as Mr. Blau stein describes it, a carny act. The problem is that he doesn't articulate any of his own thoughts beyond a few slight asides.
96118|1|[Jones] makes the father's pride, determination, stubbornness, patriotism, and love extremely, utterly believable, sympathetic, and involving.
8335|1|Like other Shelton movies, it's dappled with interesting characters.
39827|0|Fans of the genre will find very little to appreciate here, while those who aren't fans will find even less. Unless you're desperately looking for a little T&A and blood, then it's best to stay away from this party.
45716|1|The film's light tone and Amy Irving's likable performance compensate up to a point for Joan Micklin Silver's technical deficiencies.
18618|0|None of the amusement gained in watching the performances, unfortunately, amounts to much, as the script, in a desperate attempt to lend action interest to the original, static, puzzle plot, compounds surprise turn after surprise turn.
10240|1|Alive with the luscious turn-ons of sex and danger, Freeway is the most impressive debut film I've seen all year.
91725|0|The triad of performances by Toby Jones, Sandra Bullock and Daniel Craig keep it on its feet, but after a certain point it's stumbling aimlessly.
46235|1|It dodges the pitfalls of message-heavy teen movies and skirts the spite of the dumb-and-dumber era it arguably helped birth. Add two innately loveable leads and you can see it takes some smarts to sell something quite this daft.
67483|1|Halle is always great to watch and this is a well-written horror story.
6419|1|A low-budget horror/fantasy with some rough edges, Cronos reveals the dark genius of Guillermo del Toro's fecund mind.
13087|1|A bio-epic on the order of Lawrence of Arabia, Patton is a smart, even-handed, fully realized historical film. [Blu-Ray]
30260|1|A genial date comedy that will divide audiences and genders on the prominence of sports in a relationship.
84929|0|Dance sets up a charming premise and then slowly lets the air out of it over the course of 100 minutes, limping to a predictable and pat conclusion.
20896|0|The script by Steven Brill is pure formula and totally predictable. He takes absolutely no chances.
23353|1|An ingenious fable, screenwriter Ross's directorial debut playfully spoofs the small-minded lifestyle idealised by 'family values' advocates, and the intolerance and insecurity underlying that ideal.
9321|1|A flawless swashbuckler!
69629|1|The film discards serious discussion for Mexican standoffs and action scenes, trading the possibility of complex rewards for simple pleasures.
1439|1|Sounds like a French farce, you say? Well, you got that right. And it's just as entertaining.
61063|0|Formulaic but family-friendly revision and updating of the familiar coming-of-age drama.
58949|1|It's Spielberg who pulls the con by leading us down a familiar path only to rup the rug out from under us.
30442|0|It's another burnout role for Nicolas Cage, to which he brings his vast repertoire of grimaces and shuffles, as if he were variously impersonating a gargoyle on amphetamines and late Elvis on downers.
9794|1|One of the rare movies sporting great action sequences and a ring of truth.
3391|1|Robert Redford's best and richest directorial effort...
37365|1|There have been only three truly breathtaking torch singers in movie history: Rita Hayworth, Jessica Rabbit, and Michelle Pfeiffer.
78409|1|It's a brutal, vicious, well done psychological thriller that will leave you disturbed for days.
41283|0|This cheaply produced schlock is possibly the worst of the '70s trucker movies. One Chuck Norris' worst.
52499|0|"Time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool ""Clockstoppers,"" but that doesn't mean it still won't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life."
61382|1|For every bit that's flatly derivative ... there's another that connects.
55030|1|A unique document of the surreal at work within the confines of the everyday.
24513|1|Learning, especially from Scorsese, in his approach to action and performance, writer/director/star Stallone has somehow contrived to make each of his movies into a more magnificent spectacle than the last.
95017|1|As an anomaly, a curio, even as half a movie, it's a winner. As a stand-alone feature, it struggles to stand up to close scrutiny.
92189|1|A moderately amusing documentary about the second most offensive word in the English language.
87483|1|"""Lonesome Jim"" is worth checking out, if nothing else for the performances and Buscemi's idiosyncratic sense of irony."
78048|0|It's an obsessed film that is too murky to be great cinema, but interesting enough to remain intriguing.

67359|1|As disquieting a portrait of psychosis as has ever spilled across the screen.
71881|0|The structure is a mess (the film was recut against Peckinpah's wishes), which ultimately makes it difficult to tell whether its oddly compelling qualities are the result of a coherent artistic strategy or the cynical carelessness of a director sidelined.

28567|1|Inferior to the original, but enough jokes hit their marks to make it worthwhile.
13854|1|It's not just a great horror movie. It's a poem of horror, a symphony of dread, a film so rapt, mysterious and weirdly lovely it haunts the mind long after it's over.
74476|1|It's a polished and exciting thriller, mercifully unburdened with heavy political/philosophical digressions.

46693|0|Calling Pink Cadillac dumb is an insult to dumb movies.
5412|1|Agreeably camped-up biopic, ringing with righteous sentimentality and brassy defiance, with a furiously good central performance from Bassett.
55615|1|Some say this remake is better than the original, but it ain't so.

39252|1|You don't have to be a Star Trek fan to enjoy this rollicking movie. J.J. Abrams' reboot of the 1966 TV space adventure series is fast-paced, action-packed and lots of fun.

66318|1|An unforgettable nightmarish vision of excessive violence and cruelty.
24106|0|The movie had its moment in the sun, somebody made a lot of money from it and then it vanished. Mercifully so in most ways, but not without leaving at least a little whiff of younger, happier days behind.
19443|0|It's an interesting movie to look back on for its attitudes: In the guise of being a consciousness-raiser it plumps for male tenderness and demonizes the mother who can't recognize how far her workaholic ex-hubbie has come.
78351|1|Gets its great groove from the humor and dignity of the true blues musicians it documents.

43715|1|Hopeless script, but lots to look at.
66149|1|Alongside Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs, this was the most astonishing and hard-hitting directorial debut of the 1990s.

10889|1|A brash, brutal crime-caper film, Reservoir Dogs has enough raw energy for 10 motion pictures and more than enough rough stuff to traumatize the sensitive. But not only does Dogs have teeth, it has brains.

47990|1|A genre film, but it tries to tell a story from a different angle - not through tough guys and excessive violence but through a character-driven drama with several different perspectives.
83581|0|As a comedy this movie works. As a love story, the movie contains no sparks. The dialogue is stilted and unnatural, which belittles the drama.

91249|0|It turns into yet another graphic Hostel-style killfest that eventually washes away all the fun ... with lots of blood.
42103|0|For all the opulence, there's a distinct overall glumness in tone.
78687|0|While the material itself has promise (it's an adaptation of Anne Holm's best-selling novel), this drama fumbles and stumbles its way to a resolution that's far too easy.

68234|0|It's not a total loss, but the voice-over is infuriatingly overdone, as if the film-makers didn't trust the visuals, the kids are resistible and the tone's discomfortingly cute.

47089|1|Pretty good -- nice-looking -- black comedy with less copouts than usual.

74011|1|With extremely heavy echoes of his own 1998 film Ringu, Nakata is on subtle creep-out form here rather than big horror movie mode.
66729|0|Good Boy! is occasionally clever, but is never laugh out loud funny or gripping.
82527|1|Compelling and honest with flashes of dark humour which makes this a meaty comedy drama.
17650|0|Three major stars being involved, it all wraps up happily but implausibly.
3261|0|As a thriller, Murder in the First has all the elements but is so flamboyant and overblown that it becomes off-putting quite quickly.
15482|1|An epic story that deeply explores the lives of Jewish expatriots during World War II.
10156|1|An enchanting and humane fable.
68297|1|Garcia excels at eliciting strong performances throughout and maintaining a consistent mood poised delicately between wry comedy and more serious contemplation of contemporary American female lives.
42326|1|The big screen hasn't shown us a more earthy, commanding woman since Italy's iconic Anna Magnani made her stand.
33342|0|Dismal sequel to a thoroughly inessential movie.
72844|1|Static, dated, stagebound, but it's the Marx Bros.!
62772|1|Mann's first film with James Stewart, with whom he was to make a series of classic Westerns, this offers the clearest example of Mann's use of the revenge plot.
85409|0|Happy Endings is two-thirds of a really good film.
10439|1|An engaging character study.
53575|1|Grant, seeming to get better the further he's allowed to extend his range, delivers a terrific central performance, as acerbic but more complex than his sexy snake in Bridget Jones.
57435|1|A stinging film on Hollywood's studio system.
90243|1|This documentary about one of the most loathed, lampooned and beloved music genres isn't the kind of film to rock your world, though it may well inspire laughter.
60930|0|Its pretensions have the ring of, if not exactly a vanity project, a strictly personal obsession.
57592|1|Eminem's edgy, graphic quasi-biopic is not for kids.
82792|1|It felt like I was back in my childhood watching serial chapters at a Saturday matinee.
46914|1|Passable, but nothing but a shadow of previous Pryor/Wilder comedies.
4751|0|While Another Stakeout must have looked good on paper, the film seems like a hurried proposition that could have used another screenplay draft.
13432|1|What lifts the production above the run-of-the-mill is swift direction by Martha Coolidge, who has a firm grasp over the manic material.
100531|1|The X-Files 2: I Want to Believe isn't a groundbreaking film by any stretch %u2014 but that it challenges the viewer to consider certain moral imperatives in a season devoted to films revolving around explosions and fart jokes makes it a daring pie
21554|1|An intimate and entertaining animated epic...
69654|1|It never bored me, but it never truly moved me either. I liked it, but I wanted to fall in love with it.
43420|0|This personality vacuum is a real problem in a film that purports to depict a day in the life of young pop stars whom audiences can actually relate to.
45608|1|"Not unlike its cousin, ""Less Than Zero,"" this one's slick, well-acted, surface-deep, and enjoyably disturbing."

69187|1|[An] imaginative, only occasionally naive forecast of the age of nuclear warfare in 1936.
56977|0|A Cotton-candy rendition of Scott Spencer's powerful novel, Endless Love is a manipulative tale of a doomed romance which careens repeatedly between the credible and the ridiculous.
69689|0|Starts off promisingly. Eventually, though, it collapses into melodrama.
49560|1|It's all far more complicated than it needs to be, but then again, what would you cut?
38444|0|Any subtlety is lost in the broader superficiality of a work which fails to engage on an emotional level.
55937|1|Contradicts everything we've come to expect from movies nowadays. Instead of simply handling conventional material in a conventional way, Secretary takes the most unexpected material and handles it in the most unexpected way.
31061|1|"Bousman's editing and camera angles are consistently inventive, and the production design (Blade Runner is a big influence, as is Disneyland's ""Haunted Mansion"" attraction) squeezes a lot of bang out of every buck."
39470|0|A plodding production.
33151|0|a clumsy mix of film noir and the serial killer genre, with some surveillance paranoia and Freudian psychology thrown in for good measure
1501|0|Rather lame.
88456|1|Annapolis is a good film basically because it's not a bad film.
42519|1|The most interesting part of this movie is its use of broad strokes to mask subtle sketches and careful characterizations.

11383|1|Beautiful, carefully groomed, French epic.
2156|0|A not-bad chick flick with a striking performance by Gwyneth Paltrow.
66084|1|...at least this version isn't saddled with a lead performance from the notoriously stiff Josh Hartnett.
34558|1|Fun, one-of-a-kind, and sometimes scary, adventure/comedy with the always-delightful, John Lithgow.
4737|0|Even Beavis and Butt-head get to call in their critique. Naturally, they think the Lone Rangers suck.
96504|0|[A] pretty much wit-free utterly uninspired takedown of the spunky-underdogs-beat-the-odds genre.

13026|1|Riotously funny.
23983|1|Every now and then, an undertaking like Kong comes around, and it underscores the truly extraordinary accomplishment of directing a film.
33922|1|About more than Bosnia: it's about the immigrant experience; it's about tolerance; it's about making a difference; it's about learning to make the best of what one has.
76648|1|Uncle Sam may never be widely considered as a classic horror flick, but it's leaps and bounds better than the usual crap that's shoved down our throats.
10852|1|This second-tier Hitchcock is best known for Grace Kelly's star turn and sleek production values, including use of 3D.
50031|1|A subtle, poignant portrait of mature love, of the strength and conviction required to keep the faith.
13752|1|[The film impresses] with its painterly and dramatic lighting, beautiful dissolves and tracking shots, sophisticated effects, and unexpected eccentricities.
53369|0|For those, like this reviewer, who revere Allen as one of the greats, it's best that Hollywood Ending be quickly buried.
85903|1|A handcrafted masterpiece.
82816|1|While the film is over the top at times, Coach Carter has a big heart that doesn't shy away from challenging the American education system.
90668|1|Some of Will Ferrell's biggest fans might find it overly tame and subtle, but it's interesting, enjoyable and a revelation to see he can keep his pants on and still entertain.
95516|1|The movie is extremely hilarious, yet very serious and emotional at the same time.
16727|1|Murray's insouciant Sixties clowning survives being parachuted into the Eighties
96342|0|"I guess you could call it a ""satire,"" but it doesn't particularly care to take the time or energy to spin the satire in any meaningful way; it merely thunders over all its ideas like a rabid elephant."
97658|0|Disappointing, badly overwritten drama from Woody Allen, rendered almost unwatchable by dreadful Cockney accents from McGregor and Farrell.
49956|0|Williams impresses, the script does not
10712|1|An attempt to capture the same zaniness the Marx Brothers had in Duck Soup.
6160|1|We are never made to care much about the afflicted characters because Altman doesn't and thereby the stories carry very little weight.
72937|0|Unlike Woody Allen's nebbishes, who are always the smartest and funniest people on the screen, Elliot is a bore.
62679|1|Highly enjoyable.
59388|1|Makes us wonder, in a very human sense, about the various blinders we all adopt to make our peace with life.
100144|0|Undemanding fans of softcore nudity and hardcore gore will chew it down, but real horror afficionados will crave more meat on the bone.
43623|1|So good throughout that the film easily had the potential to be great.
3306|1|Packed with bloody raw emotion.
43466|0|The Forsaken is positively anaemic.
5774|1|Tilda Swinton's performance as Orlando in this adaptation of Virginia Woolf's novel is luminous and thrilling, an omnisexual romp through 400 years of history.
15443|0|Add to these problems the fact that Fathers' Day is a comedy starring two reputedly hilarious people who don't make you laugh once, and you have a movie that would be great if everything about it weren't terrible.
89204|1|Almodovar's latest is an emotionally rich film about forgiveness, atonement, and second chances that either sex can relate to.
11572|0|As trite as the framework is, Dear God might have been a charming holiday film, if only its miracles weren't so trite.
91201|1|Gripping, powerful, heart-breaking.
41147|1|A fitting dramatic tribute to the deadly brinksmanship that pulled us back from the edge during the most volatile two weeks of the Cold War.
99050|0|A movie about memory loss shouldn't be so forgettable.
357|0|There are so many numbskull moves by almost every character, it becomes more of an exercise in frustration than an enjoyable viewing experience.
60815|1|Finally, a baseball melodrama with a full count of emotional impact. Hancock's narrative delivers the right pitch of intensity

57923|1|A tough, gritty and occasionally sadistic police thriller with director/star Burt Reynolds in peak form.
24063|0|Ron Howard has as much business lamenting the death of the Rust Belt as Russ Meyer adapting Shakespeare -- and it shows.
77362|1|Fellini's half-affectionate, half-acerbic nostalgia
33495|1|Amusing trifle, notable chiefly for Paul Reubens' performance.
25957|1|Unnecessary sequel is nonetheless entertaining; Roddy Mcdowall back in simian shape.
62514|0|Death by sequel. Extremely violent sequel.
29533|1|Masterfully constructed and yet eventually rather wearisome.
14531|1|Clooney is just one of a stellar cast perfectly suited to their roles, with Tilda Swinton, Tom Wilkinson and Sydney Pollack sharing his command of the material whenever they're on screen.
90020|1|It's not seamless, but Wilson fans can safely roll out the welcome mat.
86605|1|Framed by tons of rare footage, No Direction Home penetrates the soul of one of modern music's greatest icons - at least as much as Dylan will let us.
19451|0|Hugely popular on its initial release, this looks, in retrospect, like nothing much more than a glossy soap passed off as serious drama.
70779|1|Bresson's third feature and in many ways his first major work.
17562|0|A harmless but idiotic direct-to-video romantic comedy concerned about the issues of fate.
90649|1|An emotional and gripping two hours plus that rarely flags.
62616|1|A film of mementos, of deliberately pale shadows
68602|1|This gorgeously shot, surreal feature about a middle-aged usewife, Fellini's first work in color, stars his wife Masina in their last collaboration together.
37794|1|A hip, cool, entertaining thriller.
60583|0|A tale of courage so facile and off-handedly racist that only Hollywood could have invented it. It confuses slaughter with action, and it's stupid, too.
41238|0|Huston's biggest misfire; ponderous and sluggish.
96146|0|Pleasant but pedestrian.
69915|0|[A] leaden farce.
69437|1|Delightful comedy, older teens and parents only.
42611|0|Van Damme should have stuck to the martial-arts flicks
97242|1|This plot may sound somewhat ludicrous on paper, but Pullman has created a logical, well-thought-out world that Weitz has brilliantly translated to the big screen.
34716|1|Indie director and movie star team up for thrilling, smart, snappy entertainment with a message.
78189|0|Falls short of its source.
27126|0|Must be one of those movies Christopher Lee means when he says he never made any horror pictures, huh?
95923|1|There is a lot of cleverness at work here, especially when the movie switches from the Blair Witch-style shaky camera to more accomplished and atmospheric low-budget lensing.
32785|0|A distended, talky, redundant and moody melodrama.
34989|0|Will someone please, please, write a part for Julia Roberts and not be happy just to look at her?
69150|1|Satisfyingly entertaining.
24721|0|This is by no means so good as Mr. Keaton's previous efforts.
20367|0|Most sci-fi movies offer escape, a holiday from homework, but Dune is as difficult as a final exam. You have to cram for it.
67528|1|Arcand gives us a wonderful portrait of real people forced to reconcile their pasts against a certain future and rejoicing in what once was and can continue to be...
74887|0|...a drippy, maudlin, melodramatic, semi-romantic, sometimes comedy.
21847|1|Wait for the end credits -- the mindless nonsense interspersed between the cast and crew lists is off the wall.
81619|0|The effect is so distancing that all but the most adventurous filmgoer will have trouble sitting through all 100 minutes of it.
20140|1|An amazing achievement despite a total lack of sincerity, and any film that can successfully work Slayer's grinding tune Angel of Death into the action is a masterpiece as far as I'm concerned.
3027|1|It's a near timeless milestone in cinema that lives up to its legacy as a simple, exciting, and fun science fiction fantasy.
59012|0|Dozens of characters deserve more exploration, so most of the cast is given very little to do, and scant few minutes to do it in.
83051|0|The writing shows occasional wit and the performances are charming enough, but there is too much working against them.
68343|1|Flows in a lambent pop style, warm to the touch and scarily intimate
80143|1|Gory, imaginative, wildly melodramatic -- good fun.

102589|1|A great combination of tour-de-force acting and quality drama.
3142|1|Classic monster movie still electrifies.
52623|1|The quirky drama touches the heart and the funnybone thanks to the energetic and always surprising performance by Rachel Griffiths.
33731|0|A mad assemblage of earlier, better bungle-in-the-jungle stories.
98903|1|Brand shows that top comedians, for all their limited range, can be decent actors in the right parts, a heightened sense of timing affording them an advantage in comic fare.
51193|0|Everyone else, including Mr. Caan and John Houseman, who plays a leading Houston executive, is more solemn and serious than the movie ever merits.
29214|1|Earthy, gritty and real; for older kids.
75425|0|The new version is an adequate technical exercise ... but the attempts at 'originality' undermine whatever meager integrity the original possessed.
84104|1|Toolbox Murders is Hooper's best work in years.
84024|0|This isn't a bad movie; it's just watered down.
89415|0|Holes, Because of Winn-Dixie and now, Hoot. Since we don't really have after school TV specials anymore, these kid novels-turned-hokey movies seem to be fitting the bill.
20353|1|Director Stephen Frears accelerates entertainingly through Christopher Hampton's wig-and-powder sado-comedy about sexual mind games in 18th-century France.
82811|0|I'm not against the idea of a talking zebra in and of itself, but this movie containing said articulate quadruped is decidedly bad.
83412|1|Plenty entertaining and chock full of valuable lessons about friendship and respect.
97500|0|There are some likable elements to this unusual, erratic, ultimately frustrating film.
75897|0|Es triste tener que decirles que lo único grato de la cinta es el cuerpo desnudo de la Heather...
57618|1|Moore gives one of the year's great performances -- subtle, lingeringly rich -- in director Todd Haynes's peculiar revisionist homage to old Hollywood women's pictures.
91730|1|Brave heroine risks it all in biblical epic.
2976|0|Despite its merits, the script fails to escape the silly season that fouls up so many thrillers, that time when the twists merely seem like the narrative equivalents of those violin shrieks on a cheesy score.
25831|1|Directed with a nimble, savvy touch.
11186|0|We want stomach butterflies, but all we get are soda bubbles.
102584|0|One finds a mechanical plot which is scarcely worthy of the cast, which includes Clark Gable, William Powell, Myrna Loy and Leo Carrillo.
97538|1|All of the actors clearly relish the film's fast and busy pace, smart dialog and vivid characterisations.
6509|1|"Simplistic and stupid, but it made me laugh a lot. And compared to Part 2, it's real close to ""Citizen Kane."""
14101|0|The absolute nadir of the series, a movie so bad in so many ways that the second-worst has to squint and use binoculars to see that far down.
91106|0|The plot is too laboriously constructed, and the reason for the murders appears too incredible.
56706|1|The film engages with the divergent paths taken, linked by childhood friendship and a mewling kitten, but a third act event is presented so abruptly it confuses the viewer until it rebounds somewhat with a satisfying closure.
13482|0|Alden's script goes from charming to preposterous to preachy.
36314|1|It's a wham-bam bumpy ride, great fun in the old-fashioned war movie tradition.
85052|1|The Deal could have had a more solid impact with a leaner script shaving off some of those subplot detours. And can we drop those lewd seduction routines in these movies already that hello, would never get the babe in the real world.
24168|1|Drew comes through for us. Her easy charm and winning smile put us back on track, giving us something familiar and wonderful to cling to.
75626|1|A quietly told film that--by casually tossing in a surprise here and a plot twist there--builds up to an ending that carries an intense emotional impact.
85030|1|As coming-of-age stories go, My Summer Of Love is far more provocative and mysterious than most.
8080|1|A successful summer diversion, the kind of film you start forgetting the moment it's over but is fun while you're watching it.
60577|1|"Just because Larry King called this ""One of the funniest movies ever"" doesn't mean the rest of us have to similarly lose control of our mental faculties. Still, this isn't nearly as awful as its reputation, thanks mainly to its three central performances."
21044|1|Disney classic is delightful but sometimes scary.
3632|1|Mr. Spacey's Buddy is a caricature so dazzling that even Buddy might have to say something nice about it: cool, withering, studiously suave, and spurred by impulses that might seem peevish even in a 2-year-old child.
25445|0|Adolescence was never supposed to be this wholesome.
75205|1|Kings Row (1942) combines a turn-of-the-century setting with a small-town melodrama uncovering evil and depravity.
45326|1|From a strictly visual standpoint, the film is like nothing you've ever seen. In terms of story, however, you've seen it all before.
81591|0|The only real scares here take place as images in Brody's head when he hallucinates under Dr. Becker's treatment. The rest of the film has a somewhat sappy quality to it and doesn't deliver any suspense or thrills of any kind.
82642|0|Stander refuses to take a stand on its own subject matter.
71812|1|Moving drama about a troubled man.
36941|1|When it hit cinemas in the summer of 1925, the Berlin-premiere audience applauded Chaplin's 'dance of the dinner rolls' for so long that the film was rewound and replayed, while the BBC recorded 10 straight minutes of audience laughter at one screening.
6528|0|It sounds like a horror movie, but it's a romantic fairy tale. The scariest thing about it is its shamelessness.
60690|1|Although the ending briefly dips into some silly sentimentality, the film as a whole is liberated by Cassandra's sardonic charm and a madcap exploration of the mother-daughter nexus.
8082|0|Fled is a movie without a brain in its head, and it borrows cheerfully from lots of other movies, but at least it has the integrity to acknowledge its sources.
54124|0|Bogus and wickedly unoriginal.
69350|1|The story is a bit cliché, but it bristles with energy and positivism.

54241|0|The star and his numbskull cronies piss on Capra's grave with acrid insincerity.
6943|0|Had a pop artist handled this, the franchise could have had its On Her Majesty's Secret Service; with machines directing machines, however, it's closer to its Live and Let Die
97073|1|Great heist tale, with good visual style.
50272|0|Cussler's attempt to make his concept of an ironclad ship making its way from Richmond to the African desert is no more credible on film than on the written page.
70290|1|Richly composed and photographed, with atmosphere aplenty, Ashes and Diamonds suffers somewhat from an excess of loose plot ends and of underdeveloped characters, perhaps a consequence of having been based on a prestigious novel.
29607|0|This might have been tailor-made by director Pollack to ease Ford into more straightforwardly romantic territory.
53733|1|Director Otto Preminger's only western is a simple, frequently charming, and beautifully photographed film blessed with fine performances and great teamwork from Robert Mitchum and Marilyn Monroe.
6329|1|It has problems - a LOT of problems - but as bubblegum westerns go, there's also a lot to like.
11802|1|Soderbergh brings a bracing edge of humor to his probingly analytical drama.
28730|0|Beyond Mirren's performance, there's not really much reason to see this film.
42366|0|Blow Dry is enjoyable in a low-key way, but it's far from an unqualified hit, and lacks the infectious energy of Beaufoy's earlier effort.
21515|1|Aside from its title, there's no secret about it: The Secret of NIMH is exciting, engaging, and often magnificent to look at.
72928|0|A droll romantic comedy that relies on a self-deprecating brand of humor which must be a bit of an acquired taste. The film's utter predictably sinks this exercise in obviousms, making its few funny moments not worth waiting for.
25476|1|A tough, entertaining homage to the kind of gritty '70s crime film that long ago gave way to a slicker yet tamer form of action movie ... Both the studio's cut and Helgeland's cut work about equally well.
3878|0|Fans and would-be fans of Ann M. Martin's books may be enthralled, but, for the rest of us, The Baby-Sitters Club is something of an endurance contest.
72834|1|What's most evident, however, is the raging egomania at the center of the brothers' comedy - Groucho in particular.
37061|0|For this movie 007's license to thrill had definitely been revoked.
4822|1|Underrated nineties gem!
98061|1|Awkwardly preachy yet charmingly personal.
58384|0|Perry's playing-to-the-cheap-seats drag shenanigans hijack a morose street melodrama every 15 minutes and haul it into places even Flavor Flav fears to tread.
36733|1|Its aww-shucks charm becomes hard to resist as the three sailors dart around Manhattan, looking for culture, sights, and, of course, 24-hour love.
82745|0|Unfortunately, the story is painfully recycled, heavily indebted to Blade Runner (1982), along with healthy dollops of Beauty and the Beast, Isaac Asimov's robot stories and the mythological echoes.
35538|0|Sadly, the PVC-clad Nyah is a crashing bore.
40416|1|I wanted [Buddy and Abby] to become lovers, which means they sold me on themselves.
57763|0|Writer/director Kari Skogland clearly has an agenda - the film is vehemently anti-gun - resulting in incredibly obvious and preachy instances of dialogue and a ham-fisted approach to the storyline.
94124|0|Is this movie a good old-fashioned good versus evil potboiler or a newfangled political statement about anti-intellectualism? The Reaping could have gone either way, but it did neither, and it did so spectacularly.
89688|1|Cynical and raunchy comedy for adults only.
51143|1|Really likeable family comedy set in cutthroat Hollywood.
85198|0|This wobbly low fidelity romantic comedy is filled with distinctly unlikable characters and an unsubstantiated use of child sexuality that further clouds the film's morally rudderless course.
39403|0|Bait probably would have been better with a little less plotting and more leisure time for Foxx and his friends to really develop memorable moments.
44681|1|Zen masters can see and appreciate the beauty in a cracked, bumpy, and uneven pot....Carlos is a Zen master in the making whose love enables him to see Nicole's inner beauty.
36619|0|With a plot that is constructed entirely out of formula situations and familiar plot elements, Center Stage feels like a rerun of Flashdance grafted onto The Cutting Edge.
76157|1|...an entertaining yet undeniably forgettable romcom that benefits substantially from the stars' charismatic work.
73801|1|Less a film than a moment in time--at least that's what Ken Park's dreamy bookends would have you believe.
64819|1|Moira Shearer has a fragile loveliness and a freshness wholly lacking in almost all the stars of today -- she gives a most appealing performance.
83034|0|"While there are many of the right ingredients here -- a likable cast, plot potential, a dreamy English countryside setting -- I still can't say ""I do"" to this fluffy flick."

39884|1|Alas, poor Focker. He can't help himself. And we can't help ourselves from falling about, equally helpless, at this superbly antic movie.
99391|0|Clunky and smug, Meet Bill isn't convincing for one moment.
4210|1|Mueller's dialectical approach allows him to expose many half-truths (and a few outright lies) by adducing contrary evidence; by the film's end, Riefenstahl's apologia emerges clearly as an elaborate mythification of self and history.

19221|0|Diabolically dull and somber to the point that it's almost worth laughing at it, except that Gregory Peck's incredibly serious expressions have the tendency to make laughter dry out and die.
45167|1|Bergman never made another film this painful. To see it is to touch the extremes of human feeling. It is so personal, so penetrating of privacy, we almost want to look away.
98215|0|It's the audience that deserves Protection from this Witless Larry the Cable Guy vehicle.

48349|1|Sutherland is the key to the proceedings and his intense, narrow-minded, obsessive search for his ex-girlfriend is what kept me going most of the way.
20017|0|As needless a sequel as one could envision...
77951|0|Roberts lets his actors run loose, leading to such embarrassments as Caine's unidentifiable accent or Glenne Headly's turn as Henry's Danish * nurse.
6090|0|That`s a more upscale marketing concept than Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but it still doesn't make the movie any good.
55556|0|The handiest thing about casting a Culkin in your movie is that if he doesn't exactly fit, you can just exchange him for another, like a rented tuxedo or Baldwin.
92525|1|...There's nothing too small about Nolte's performance. He's the perfect companion for a rookie feature film director looking to make a good first impression.
17059|1|This is the most straightforward, understated, and powerful big-screen representation of the gospel in recent movie history. And for that, Amistad should be recommended to everyone.
8013|1|The best Grisham to hit the screen yet.
77459|0|This unnecessary sequel to 1999's Baby Geniuses is so bad it makes the Olsen twins' catalog of work look like Laurence Olivier's Shakespearean output.
20052|1|The Exorcist not only tops the horror genre but transcends it, resulting in a profound experience where moviemaking horror, thrillingly dramatic storytelling and deeply felt spirituality of the Catholic kind make for pivotal viewing.
29584|1|It is strong in parodying the original, so fans should look out for it so long as they've got a sense of humour.
3686|0|The problem here is clearly the script, with very little that is original and amusing.
95748|1|More sensuous than raunchy, but a remarkably engrossing adaptation of an early version of the famous Lawrence novel.
56017|1|A keeper, for its humor, its action, its hint of romance -- and its too-brief cameo by the great James Brown.
89197|1|Pedro Almodovar's Volver is amazingly bright, fresh and clean for a film dealing with murder, adultery, incest, malignant disease and the occasional supernatural apparition.
20567|1|[An] overpoweringly charming concoction of standard Gaelic tall stories, fantasy and romance.
41608|1|Dennis Quaid rocks.
47854|1|It's a little movie with a great big selling point: Robert Forster's subtly nuanced and effortlessly engaging portrayal of Eddie Miller.
4203|1|"The literally last-minute stab at domestic foreplay is simply unbelievable, but Baloo's lip-licking post-mortem (""I still think he'd a made one swell bear"") is what sticks."

71979|1|The film's real joy comes in its camp performance pieces, which outrageously poke fun at the guilty pleasures of musical theatre.
12407|1|Allen joins the Catskills tummler's anything-for-a-laugh antics with a Eurocentric art-house self-awareness and a psychoanalytic obsession in baring his sexual desires and frustrations, romantic disasters, and neurotic inhibitions.
87813|0|Beautiful but slight.
1720|0|As for Two-Face, my favorite Batman baddie on the printed page, Tommy Lee Jones makes a complete mockery of the character with a broad performance that's difficult to stomach.
35830|0|It's a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting, but none of it is terribly funny.
37398|0|The death trips are part travelogue, part bad dream, and they quickly start to pall with the same scene basically being repeated five times.
81358|1|The solid screenplay satisfyingly clicks everything together, unraveling little mysteries as it goes and leaving nothing hanging.

86205|0|While this misleading doc lauds neo-conquistador Eisenhower for coining and anticipating the military industrial complex, let's not forget how he propagated something else - the CIA extra-legal tactic of target assassinations.

77437|0|Big hair, tight shorts, crappy skating, terrible acting. And Linda Blair.

11491|1|Gast never makes a mistake by turning the camera on Ali-he comes through like a champ
100119|1|Too loose and aimless to sit with Herzog's best, Encounters drifts along on its filmmaker's frostbitten humour and his ever-searching eye for weirdness and wonder.
12686|1|Perhaps the best the Coens have to offer -- stylish, funny, harrowing and brilliantly shot.
74612|1|If the take-no-prisoners humor of Citizen Toxie is very funny, the movie's relentless comic excess is ultimately a little exhausting.
8362|1|It is a long (three hours), often exciting and always well-directed film about the struggle for survival of one of the five Mafia 'families,' the Corleones, in late 1940s New York.
72072|1|It seems a shame to waste any of these actors on a movie with no higher aspirations than educing a few second-rate chills.
78626|0|[A] comedy so broad it barely dents its targets and a patronising moral conclusion that goes against everything its protagonists originally stood for.
74027|1|It bears as little relation to the real Nashville as Altman's 1975 feature, but director Peter Bogdanovich, the talented cast, and the credited and uncredited screenwriters are so busy conjuring up a charming world of their own that I didn't mind.
90752|0|Kiddie-friendly toilet humour, a whiff of suspense and familiar voice actors make it passably entertaining, but there's little warmth or emotional satisfaction to be had from its cynical characters.

71805|1|The shelf life of a marriage is meticulously plotted by Sweden's leading arthouse director. Not that the plotting is over: Saraband, is the master's newest edition to the marriage saga-- years after and will be released this year ( 2003).
72233|1|No matter how contrived the format seems at times, every one of the hard-luck tales is violently good pulp.
57542|0|Bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable. But for the most part, The Weight of Water comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness.
17617|0|Things are pushed over the top rather successfully, but breaking momentum is a pretty big mistake for movie that wants to wow us with ruthless efficiency.
90578|1|A solid little B-movie arriving cloaked in the dodgy garb of a fanboy phenomenon, Snakes on a Plane really ought to garner some sort of award for truth in advertising: It's exactly what it says it is and very little else.
58774|1|The thriller inadvertently becomes an exercise in erotic violence: Director Bigelow turns the heroine's uniform and gun into fetishism, making her film a field day for Freudian psychologists.
99835|1|A wildly funny parody of low-budget horror cinema.
74823|1|In a breakthrough role as the new nun, Deborah Kerr heads a superb cast, including Flora Robson and Jean Simmons, in one of the most stunning color films ever made, deservedly winning the Oscars for cinematography and art design.

38802|1|This movie clearly means a whole lot to Clint Eastwood, and he does a darn good job of showing why.
85924|1|Leave it to Judd Apatow to take a simple concept you'd find in basically any sex comedy, and add his own original twist on it.
13469|0|The screen is swamped by a bathetic, self-preening sententiousness.
68559|1|Lancaster's brilliant performance anchors Frankenheimer's fine film, a liberal-minded, optimistic celebration of the power of redemption.
32371|0|Columbus lays on the sentimentality thickly, sometimes letting it get in the way of the storytelling. The longer the movie continues, the more overt he becomes in his emotional pandering.

43630|1|The most famous and infamous propaganda film of all time is revealing for its stern depiction of the way Hitler's Germany sought to present itself to its own countrymen and to the outside world.
96569|0|The movie, which looks like it was made on the cheapest camera borrowed from the A/V club, was apparently based on the experience of its writer, Reed Fish, who should either await more interesting experiences or work up some imagination.
97948|1|In Bruges is a refreshingly different take on the hitmen genre.
19400|1|"Its trigger-fast, explosive scenes and high-tension chase sequences (the one in ""Bullitt"" pales by comparison) will have you literally gasping for breath."

75075|0|"The terrible problem with ""Father Hood"" is that no one involved seemed to have any idea of what kind of movie it should be, and one feels their conflicting visions at play throughout."
78537|0|The latest installment of the life of Bridget Jones is tired and sloppy.
76412|0|The style is intact but the content is missing.

24433|1|Saturday Morning Picture Club stuff, only dearer.
45222|1|Somehow the flat, arid Nevada landscape mirrors the characters' bleak existence and sets the overall mood of despair and depression.
59410|1|Refreshingly free of postmodernist theorizing and gender-study cant.
11974|1|Action thrillers assail but rarely test us; this is the tautest, most provoking, and altogether most draining example ever made.
56557|0|The threat implied in the title Pokémon 4ever is terrifying - like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming.

73064|1|Unfolds like a novel full of characters we can't help but care about.
69237|1|an utterly mesmerizing and completely disjointed crime thriller that is more about tone and style than it is about its fragmented narrative
18109|1|It's a modern corporate espionage type thriller and it's cool. It's got a smart pedigree and a tiny budget and big big ideas.
71247|0|Johnny Depp is the saving grace of a sub-par, often boring mystery film with a spirited performance.
67186|1|This is the first entry in Universal's modernized version of the Sherlock Holmes series.
71729|0|Both the characters and the setting are a bit of a blank here, so it's no surprise the movie is, too.
54042|0|It has a basic problem, which is that there is no popular original material for it to satirize.
48578|0|Few films benefited that much from being so short.
50634|1|Minghella lays on the whimsy a bit thick at times, but his wryly funny and heartfelt observations on sorrow go down much easier than the Hollywood brand of lump-in-the-throat histrionics.
60983|1|The Hundred Acre Wood never looked so appealing.
94938|1|This is not just another penguin movie.
44067|1|While not one of Altman's strongest films, this cynical tale merits a look as a meditation on American history, mythmaking, and showbusiness
83005|0|Hide and Seek is a technically slicker paranoid thriller than director John Polson's previous Swimfan, but its esteemed posture makes it even trashier.
39238|0|A rather lazily imagined, though energetically executed pastiche of big screen sci-fi clichés seemingly appropriated at random from other films.
60658|1|All that fancy footwork, wow! And a mature story that manages to rise above the typical teen fare. And Freddy Prinze, Jr. isn't anywhere to be found.
18310|1|A funny and clever caper with a most unlikely romantic hero.
6740|1|This animated movie based on the comics of the same title is fun once you accept it on its own terms, i.e., brainless and adolescent.
92998|0|Even in the realm of oversized animal movies, this is a singularly appalling effort.
32142|0|The lowdown? This ain't sweet.

71372|1|DeNiro can play a complete wimp and Murray can play a heavy--who knew?
54144|1|...an affable but hopelessly uneven fantasy...
47120|0|Aside from a strangely eclectic collection of supporting actors, Worth Winning offers nothing you'd want to spend 90 minutes with.
62389|0|Instead of escalating the comedy the remake merely makes it empty and more expensive.
32032|1|McTeer shines in her film debut, bringing to the screen a naturalness not seen in a long time.
83884|1|Mitchell, in her dual role, gives a breakout performance (two of them, in fact).
65937|0|A half-hour sitcom stretched into an unfathomable 90 minutes of played-out ethnic caricatures that should land the entire cast a lifelong ban from Italian pride parades.
38830|1|A last hurrah for the type of on-camera, practical monster effects that would soon go the way of the dinosaur, extinguished by the asteroid impact of digital technology.
41123|0|The comedy inherent in toupee gags gradually runs dry, and the interplay between the main characters sometimes doesn't offer enough sparks to pick up the slack.

68312|1|The film is cheesy as hell but it is a ton of fun for someone who remembered how this passed as uber-edgy back in the day.
25389|0|Landis directed with his customary heavy-handed comedy touch and encouraged his cast to giggle at their own inane shenanigans.
92936|0|Stale, earnest, and dignified (like most of Henry King films), this Biblical saga primarily served as star vehicle for Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward.
99120|1|Fresh, spunky and well acted. Sally Hawkins is enchanting and the rest of the cast is enjoyable.
88521|1|Mixing mirth with more sophisticated moments, this delightful romantic romp ultimately triumphs primarily because of the easy-going screen chemistry generated by Sanaa Lathan and Simon Baker.
65761|0|"""Casa de los Baby's"" is a frustrating and tedious experience to endure."
10643|1|What is so enjoyable, apart from Harry Wild's shimmering camerawork, is the tongue-in-cheek tone of the script and performances, best evidenced in the sparkling banter and innuendo between Mitchum and Russell.
1621|1|...an intoxicating, frightening and emotionally honest essay on the self-destructive impulses of the nascent artist.
67806|1|"With its unusual look and neatly folding method of storytelling ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" is an artistically uninhibited silent horror film that still sends chills."

45711|0|Is this the one in the apartment or the one in space? Does it matter?
27685|1|If a part of me has resisted and sometimes even resented his mastery, this undoubtedly can be traced to a problem with realism that his work as a whole throws into relief. To put it crudely, why reproduce the real world when we have the thing itself?
68137|0|It's so determined to be haunting that it gives up the ghost.
46205|1|It has the charm and advantage of a genuine visual style of its own, both laconic and witty, as well as a likably dopey plot and cast of characters.
66587|0|It feels like a history lesson from a particularly inept substitute teacher, hitting only a few highlights before it returns to a flat read of gangster specifics.
55631|1|The blended themes are awkward and unnerving.

11907|1|To answer the big question first: Yes, The Empire Strikes Back is just as enjoyable as Star Wars. In fact, this is one sequel that defies tradition by being better than the original on several counts -- most of them technical, but a few dramatic.
90039|0|...less profound than it is uneven, an intermittently satisfying mix.
75050|0|Heder seems perversely bored, unable to hold his eyes open; was that a conscious acting choice, or was he simply reading his lines off the floor?
76375|1|Totally laid-back, this all seems pointlessly unstructured, until you realise that's the way it's supposed to be: an endearing look at barbell bums who may never win through, but have fun trying.
2974|0|Ridiculous from start to finish. Connery, Harris, and Fishburne couldn't have wasted their time in a less productive fashion.
87665|1|While the film itself remains a subtle attack on religious naivete, the director would never be as mindful of the possibilities of spiritual healing as he is here.
59013|0|The supporting cast alone is the worth of this film - see it for them.
36515|0|Up at the Villa is lovely to look at, but it doesn't make a great deal of sense.

5482|1|Bradford gives a memorable performance
80305|1|Though not a patch on the Clouzot movie, it is still rather gripping, the photography is superb, there is an excellent use of sound and an eerie electronic score by Tangerine Dream.

45225|1|A problematic but provocative piece of work.
88039|1|By sheer willpower (and some of the best art direction of this year or any other), this is a fitting, poetic epitaph to the life and career of Ismail Merchant.
90644|0|For all its noble intent the film brings to celluloid life makes just about every fear anyone had about a Hollywood treatment of the 9/11 tragedy.

45639|1|Keaton's performance (just barely) lifts the movie from its formula stupor.
71494|0|People who find Smith's work too brazen or fringe will really fall for this picture, likewise those easily pleased by this genre will enjoy. Hardcore fans may be very upset by Smith doing something so ordinary and even mundane.
43556|0|A fascinating work that never quite coalesces, Tuvalu finally becomes oppressively repetitive.

43022|1|James Bond for kids, Spy Kids 2 is an energetic, inventive and zappy adventure filled with colour, gadgets and larger than life characters. It's a blast of a movie.

7697|0|Coppola, of course, was abducted by aliens and replaced with a pod person in the middle of filming Godfather III.
6063|1|The movie has a lot of laughs, its action sequences are thrilling, its surprises are startling, and it shows a real ingenuity in the ways by which it gets Willis into, and out of, trouble.
73549|1|Why don't we have a Kurosawa altar at which to worship? After all, this is one temple I'd actually attend.
670|1|Rollicking, soap-like tale of women's love lives.
27706|1|This ain't Pigs in Space, but it's pretty good regardless.
77953|0|Technically a motion picture, Around the Bend is essentially an advertisement for Kentucky Fried Chicken. It also happens to be mind-numbingly cloying.
43871|0|Texans are idiots, but they have hearts as big as the great outdoors--I get it already.
41725|0|Murphy's humor is at bottom very downbeat and often, as when he describes his bowel movements, just not all that interesting.
20421|1|The very title evokes slippery visions of both spirit and sex.
44331|1|Co-directors Jason Leigh and Cummings have delivered an uncharacteristically smart comedy with surprising dramatic turns and excellent performances across the board.
97649|1|If you are looking for a bit of dippy romance at the cinema, this is worth trying on for size.
9346|1|It's one of the smartest of all noirs, and thus among the most enticingly savage and dangerous.
47955|1|After two intense hours revisiting the elemental bond between parent and child, the grit of daily life washes away.
1751|1|This silly little masterpiece regards Deneuve as the goddess of light she really was -- a figment of our collective appetite for the unreal.
10466|0|Corpses pile up, dreadful secrets are uncovered, and Bishop eventually gets to the bottom of things, a full hour after the least attentive viewer will have figured out who's behind it all.
85368|1|"Filmmakers Henry Alex Rubin and Dana Adam Shapiro wisely chose a high-energy aesthetic to portray quadriplegic rugby (a.k.a. ""Murderball"") through the story of Mark Zupan and his American teammates battling for Paralympic gold."
96135|1|It's much better than a lot of the stuff playing in theaters.
22458|0|This ode to the allure of clipping suckers and psyching out the competition is richly atmospheric but thin in the character department.
20389|1|Scorsese's film is a work of passion and faith, and admirable for the way it fearlessly explores its themes, disregarding canonical dogma in search of human truth.
22583|1|In Mike Nichols' fairy tale about the workforce, Melanie Griffith gives a charming performance as an absued scretary who decides to take charge of her life and in the process also gets the lover of her bitchy boss (well played by Sigourney Weaver).

76432|1|One of Bresson's most sublime and understated films, in a career that consists of a series of meditational masterpieces that minutely and compassionately examine the human condition.
64993|1|Redford and his team make no claim for Peltier's guilt or innocence. The issue is whether Peltier received a fair trial, and the evidence they've amassed is impressively damning.
83221|1|Throughout, Zhang emotes like Bette Davis.
3427|1|Raimi's movie borrows heavily from classic spaghetti westerns, but Raimi has a style of his own, and plenty of it.
42590|1|I prefer a little more dysfunction in my dysfunctional family comedies.
98930|1|Even if it badly needs editing, runs almost a half-hour too long and chickens out totally in its final scenes, it's still miles above the Hollywood comedy median.
29588|1|This is fun but, compared with Kurosawa's other 60s efforts, relatively slight.
22773|0|Adrian Lyne directs this film as Zalman King might direct an episode of One Life to Live
19656|1|Stillman's script is so present at every moment that it's easy to overlook how precisely the film has been directed.
71516|0|A misogynistic, dull-witted bore.

55788|0|Between explosions there is enough room left for only minimal character development.
54877|1|I come away from Signs exhilarated by Shyamalan's skill at keeping his audience guessing.
43684|1|Fellini received a well deserved Oscar nomination for this bizarre, wildly flamboyant but plotless spectacle, inspired by the firt century author Petronius, flaunting glorious production values.
57163|1|(It) is a downright transgressive film because it brazenly allows its characters to just talk. Actually it allows Andre to talk and, just as importantly, for Wally to listen.
59227|1|The film's intent to serve as a cautionary tale is admirable, but Olmos acts better than he directs, and the film is shapeless and disjointed. .
21902|1|Serves only as perverse entertainment.
57754|1|It's so good that you can practically see the Hollywood 'suits' trying to put together the cast and filmmaking team for the all-too -inevitable American remake.
4862|0|Talky, tame original sci-fi study in paranoia.
2891|0|Strains to evoke tortured artist agony, but instead just strains.

65160|0|An unappealing melancholy sitcom dramatization.
55223|1|let your mind go, forgive the wear and tear of time and enjoy the adventure
1991|0|There's swordplay to the hilt, but the story itself never quite gets in Gere.
75027|1|The movie has a curious and cumulative power.
45541|1|It's a beautifully told, charming story with lyrical songs and fabulous dance routines
99298|1|Redbelt seems like a rush job that relies too much on the quick fix. I'm very willing to suspend my disbelief, but Redbelt becomes outlandish.
82478|1|The only problem is that there's just not that much of a reason to sit up and check out what all of the noise is about.
101580|1|Mark Wahlberg's titular hero hasn't cracked a smile in seven years. The surprise is that he makes the lonely cop seem half human with half a dozen words and a staggering amount of violence.
34962|1|Film noir is the most intoxicating of Hollywood cocktails, and none is more potent than Double Indemnity.
2447|0|The schoolmaster to whom our pity is drawn is a pretty weak and lukewarm individual, hardly fit to be a teacher of growing boys -- even a teacher of classical languages, which he is.
23934|1|Pink Flamingos is the cinematic equivalent of the entire alphabet in one, prolonged belch. However relevant in this analogy, Pink Flamingos is not confined to the practices of immaturity; it is timelessly repulsive.
16947|0|There's only slightly more plot than appeared in the original computer game, and the result is undemanding fun.
78321|1|Despite an occasionally hampering pace, Vera Drake is worth [it] because of its impeccably conceived and acted characters and the moral quagmire they present us with.
55152|0|A forgettable prison boxing movie.
23556|0|The direction is as blunt and vacant as the plotting, the jokes are obvious and the performances (with a couple of exceptions) charmless.
27813|1|Thirty years later, there are still rumblings of making another sequel, but no one would dare suggest a reboot or re-imagining; Ghostbusters is perfect exactly as it is.
51289|0|Spears's technique indicates she's a graduate of the Brady Bunch Acting Academy...
62410|1|The film is sleepy and has a general air of mystery and unreality, which is fitting for a fable. All the performances are delightful.
35571|0|Somehow it comes off like a TV celebrity roast.
17701|1|Ferrara's dangerous vision of the city at night goes beyond what most creampuff directors are capable of; he gets to the core of everything from the silent, dark windows of towering penthouses to the vicious rattling of crime-ridden subways.
78287|1|A study of friendship, disappointment and self-deception, Sideways, directed by Alexander Payne, has at its centre the most leisurely of bachelor parties: it's a road movie that stops off at vineyards.
48585|0|I spent most of the movie struggling not to throw something at the screen or disrupt the other patrons by screaming in frustration.
56756|1|The wonderful lasting mark of a true artist.
8531|0|Gore seekers need only to know the body count is high and the scares are cheap as director Peter Hyams shares his beast's repellent disregard for human life.
64140|1|Gimmicky but intermittently funny, Woody Allen's feature directing debut is based on the retooling and redubbing of a minor Japanese thriller-actioner with American actors.

75520|1|The movie's influences can be found in nearly every conceivable corner of modern film.
44735|1|"""The Adventures of Felix"" and its star have charm to spare."
94073|1|this wacky comedy simply glides over the ice, never falling in the cracks or tumbling off course. Heder plays the angelic-faced blonde-mopped former child protégée ... and Ferrell is the sex addicted Tsunami of Swagger, thrown unwillingly together.
71130|1|Occassionally overflows with self-indulgence and didacticism, weakening an otherwise and often potent critique
74060|1|An absolutely riotous Western.
91637|0|Instead of glamorizing the early 20th century thug life, it humanizes it a little too much. This drags the movie down and is not the reason I like to go see gangster movies.
94187|1|It may be too ponderous for some, and an appearance by Anjelica Huston as a snake-oil peddler near the end is a touch too surreal, but if you're a fan of Westerns the way they used to make them, you'll be mesmerised.
72690|1|A film not to miss.
42432|1|The big-name cast is a great, nostalgic throwback to the 1950s, when its players' names -- Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, Kim Novak, Tony Curtis -- graced giant theater marquees.
40856|1|It looks like director Mark Dindal has been watching a lot of Chuck Jones lately.
35864|1|A guilty pleasure to be sure, but Ford is great and Robert Shaw's final speech is irresistible.
72977|1|Weird, but brilliantly done, allegorical drama.
90435|0|Alejandro González Iñárritu's latest sprawling, dispersed art-film blockbuster prompts a question: Does he just not know how to tell a story?
58081|0|Friday After Next is a lot more bluster than bite.
64826|1|gloriously original and provocative--a truly groundbreaking fusion of reality and fantasy that helped pave the way for future musicals
45676|1|...a worthy followup to Murphy and Landis' first collaboration, Trading Places.
102545|1|This is a movie specially made for viewers who like a surprise ending.
1426|1|The movie is not as special as Cinema Paradiso, but in its own way it is enchanted, too. Mother of God, what faces.
60152|1|It's one of the best films of an artist's life you'll ever see.
33576|1|Ferrara was in the right place at the right time to make Bad Lieutenant.
64095|1|The screenplay, based on a one-act play by Ferenc Molnar, is outstanding.
97761|0|A tortured talkfest with a premise far less ripe than its title.
87667|1|Three days after President Nixon brought a halt to military operations in Vietnam, another offensive maneuver was just beginning in Minneapolis.
100149|1|Here's a title that lives up to its expectations; Jay Lee's schlockingly funny horror flick is filled with inventive ideas and delivers in spades for fans of the genre
81479|1|The performers are luminous.
44|1|Just don't expect their bickering to be on the level of Neil Simon, and you won't be disappointed.
79697|1|Almost distractingly, faithful to the original novel despite its radically different setting, the film is a pleasure mostly because of its vivid Technicolor backdrops.
32620|1|Despite the absence of Chris Tucker, who launched his career in Friday, this sequel manages to be funny despite its unevenness.
16149|1|Clancy is known for writing difficult books, but the movie makes plausible a preposterous situation because of Baldwin's convincing, low-key approach to being a film hero.
41482|1|Excellent performances by lead actors Beglau and Martin Wuttke...as well as an unforgettable performance by Nadja Uhl...humanize the unfamiliar internal politics of Germany.
20770|1|A sprawling, ornately constructed entertainment.
5016|1|A very guilty pleasure. Entertaining trash.
90744|0|Isn't clever or inventive enough to make up for its repetitive and lackluster storytelling.
88108|1|Ozu's low camera position helps the audience relate to his characters, and his almost-always static shots portray the sturdy demeanor of his characters.
25920|1|Always wondered what a 'cult film' is? Try this one.
90820|0|There's absolutely nothing wrong with this movie that a good story wouldn't fix.
51658|1|It takes this never-ending confusion and hatred, puts a human face on it, evokes shame among all who are party to it and even promotes understanding.
17659|0|The ending, though emotionally satisfying, collapses under scrutiny. This lack of payoff is a real flaw in a film pitched to a discriminating sci-fi mentality.
47076|0|The film is dominated and destroyed by Mr. Cage's chaotic, self-indulgent performance.
52506|0|An intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort.
60508|0|This was supposed to be Brooks's comical stab at social injustice, a kind of My Man Godfrey for the nineties, but it doesn't work.
54569|1|As a randy film about sexy people in gorgeous places being pushed and pulled (literally and figuratively) by desire ... [Sex and Lucía] makes for an arousing good time.
79028|1|One of the greatest of the silent comedies about the effects of parental rejection.
64911|1|A superb and very disturbing documentary
11633|1|Greenaway's most famous film, but far from his best
62285|0|Relying on the stage performance alone, there is little interesting about watching Dracula, Lucy, or Nina, pirouetting and prancing within their milieu.
31185|1|Murray has been funnier and far more authoritative during his career, but he was never this joyfully floppy again. Meatballs is the crowning of his doofus glory and a great testament to his once improvisational appeal.
3093|0|A tepid remake.
62084|1|When Hoffman steps from the shower, the blond spitcurl plastered to his forehead increases his resemblance to a big, pathetic Kewpie doll. He's simultaneously lovable and repulsive.
63186|1|A stagy romantic comedy that lacks an energetic story but is rescued by the talents of its two stars.
37615|0|Lines like this are amusing, but they pop instantly, like soap bubbles.
39586|1|A Beautiful Mind is the best film yet from director Howard.
97865|0|Any resemblance to comedy is purely coincidental and unintentional. The only reason to chuckle is to prove you haven't died while watching it. Its credits should be handed to a mercenary. It's not a film. It's the Zeroes' worst pop-culture excretion.
68341|0|Undoubtedly, this is a movie only a Scrooge could love.
78357|0|The actors grapple manfully with the ersatz rural poetry of the dialogue, but Green's pacing is slow and self-indulgent, and the action often departs from recognizable human behavior.
96686|0|Sluggish storytelling enlivens neither Pitt's infatuation with a local concubine nor the stubbornly feudal society it's set against. Worst of all, though, you just never give a toss.
65669|1|A cinematic bad dream that generates recurring nightmares.
37629|1|Whoopi Goldberg is at her sassy, funny best in this upbeat 1987 cop caper, playing a Los Angeles detective who takes no nonsense and is ready for anything the badass guys can dish out
83818|1|As with any would-be summer blockbuster, the members of the special effects team are the real stars, and they haven't stinted in bringing this fantasy world to life.
15788|1|What makes this wildly imaginative setup so much fun is the contrast between the deadpan gruffness of Jones and Torn, and the spectacularly strange environment in which they work.
38351|0|Offers a look at the underground rave scene, providing an accurate picture of what one night must be like, but without giving any insight beyond the superficial.
78575|1|The most brazenly, deliciously gay film Almodovar has ever made.
27660|0|It never really gets inside us, mostly due to its overheated direction and endless Hitchcockian references.
93619|1|At its best, The Golden Door generates the excitement to be had whenever a historical movie achieves the shock of the new.
101644|0|It works much better as a comedy, but by the end, the romantic aspect has taken over and there's not much humor to be found after the first half.
34702|1|Captain Horatio Hornblower showed the 64 year-old director Raoul Walsh still able to conjure up a rousing good action picture, even in color and with a largish budget.
29330|1|At least satisfying and often is poignant.
58874|1|Don't be put off by its offbeat credentials, because this is a warm-hearted and hilarious dissection of relationships, and how honesty isn't necessarily always the best policy.
92048|1|It is indeed ironic that a film that is often so good at making one suspend their disbelief still can't generate a true emotional response in the end. Despite its shortcomings, Death of a President is an interesting and provocative work that merits
53503|1|How many times in the history of the medium have we seen a single film rattle as many socio-cinematic paradigms-and done it with as much brio-as My Beautiful Laundrette (1985)?
4518|0|In terms of action, Wayans the director relies too much on slow-motion in shooting action scenes -- a tiresome habit that undercuts the potential excitement of some sequences.
67864|1|The usual fever of adjectives -- terrific, titanic, transcendent -- sounds puny.
43084|1|"While ""Blow"" certainly has its moments of greatness, it tries too hard to sell us a product we would have bought had they not pushed it too hard."
85401|1|Most films are so insipid that there's something perversely refreshing about a movie in which a monstrous father compliments his son for his 'healthy dose of hatred...'
49585|0|These themes have been handled with more depth on I Love Lucy and The Brady Bunch.
56282|1|A gore-splattered melodrama steeped in menace, eroticism and repressed sexuality.
88166|0|District B13 is an apocalyptic action message movie with a distinct French flare.
89294|1|A damning documentary which indicts the MPAA as a thinly-veiled arm of the handful of Hollywood studios which have come to dominate the film industry.
73671|1|Through a Glass Darkly is one of the best and certainly the ripest of Ingmar Bergman's creations, a film as subtle as Wild Strawberries but solider in substance.
34870|0|Denzel, Wesley and Co are fine, but Mo' Better Blues hits too many bum notes.
83973|0|[Penn's] oafish 'character' only manages a few guffaws and a handful of chuckles, and his movie is the same.
64021|1|Si Los Lunes al Sol es una película tan humana, tan sensible y tan reveladora es porque hemos visto esos personajes acá nomás, a la vuelta de la esquina.
73368|1|Instead of true horror, what the film has to offer is atmosphere by the bucketful.
19406|1|A true Hollywood classic.
30169|1|The first and one of the best of the spaghetti westerns
3469|1|a beautiful film both emotionally and philosophically, not to mention aesthetically
85073|0|Even though director-adaptor Mary McGuckian expended much creative energy trying to pump original spirit into the characters, she never brings any of them to life.
65768|0|The story trails off in so many directions that it's hard to follow. After a while, I just found myself losing interest.
42732|1|In his black satire, Kazan and Schroeder go beyond issues of guilt and morality, exposing and contesting the stereotypes of an Odd Couple: Von Bulow as rich, arrogant Eurotrash who needs thw work of a bright, hardworking and sweaty Jewish laywer.
236|1|A fun popcorn movie.
92427|0|From haphazard editing to clueless cinematography to godawful acting to gaping plot holes to zero laughs to low production values, this sorry sequel has all the earmarks of your classic 'take the money and run' ripoff.
44631|0|Steven Spielberg tries to rescue the world's most elusive filmmaker from an unhappy ending.
90984|0|Never quite the sum of its parts, this would-be intelligent thriller coasts by on strong supporting performances from Giamatti, Sewell and Biel.
34588|0|Would you believe My Stepmother Is an Alien was better?
66734|0|Based on an informal straw poll at the film's grandiose family premiere, the audience most likely to enjoy the film is seven to ten-year-old boys.
70925|0|Sleep all day, party all night, never grow old, never die: it's fun to be a Disney starlet
63313|1|The Bank Job is an often suspenseful and sleek crime movie which shows how a group of working class slumps exposed the scandalous nature of the rich, as both spooks and crims bay for their blood.
22257|1|Another of Hitchcock's deadly mistaken-identity tales.
74972|0|I came away thinking how uninventive the story was, and how a little imagination together with a quick read from any issue of Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine might have helped.
70527|1|It's all great fun, and Blamire has at least as promising a future as all this dot.com nonsense.
32289|0|The tag line for Diamonds promises that 'searching for buried treasure was never this much fun.' Replace 'much fun' with 'dull' and that marketing slogan suddenly gains a lot of truth.
44982|1|Silly, but so campy fluff with Annette and Frankie.
75496|1|With an elliptical style and open-ended interpretations, it is definitely not for those who like their mysteries spelled out and tied up neatly.
80357|1|With the possible exception of A Hard Day's Night, it gets my vote as the all-time best rock film.
39943|1|It has a propensity for manipulativeness which keeps it from the loftiest heights, but all other ways remains an impressive piece of work.
100429|1|An idiosyncratic, largely anecdotal story with larger reverberations.
63401|0|Sure, you can go and have a few laughs, but it's going to be like that first big paycheck you got before you realized how much is taken off the top, it's just not as good as you hoped for.
36922|0|Com seu roteiro óbvio e as péssimas atuações, é incrivelmente inferior às numerosas produções que supostamente inspirou.
36833|1|The characters in Small Time Crooks are smarter, edgier and more original than the dreary crowd in so many new comedies.
44151|1|Very nearly a classic, this Americanization of Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai does a good job of mirroring the major themes and attitudes of the original while re-creating that monumental film in an occidental setting.
2407|1|It's 'Max Max on Water.' Straight up. Once you get over that, it's not unenjoyable.
79588|1|Antonioni's love story is much like a sci-fi story.
17161|1|Uno sale del cine y se da cuenta de por qué la película recibió tanta atención.
67189|1|Suspenseful and moderately entertaining.
74280|1|An entertaining work of trash.
5609|1|A movie for people who are sophisticated enough to know how shameless the film is, but fun-loving enough to enjoy its excesses and manic zeal.
97620|0|The movie's reach extends beyond it's grasp.
7263|1|A respectable film, particularly in its unequivocal details involving the characters and genuinely unpredictable outcome.
29700|0|The Haunting of Molly Hartley, sort of an updated Rosemary's Baby for teens, sucks most of the suspense out of its own suspense-thriller before the story even gets going.
19653|1|Stillman films these rounds of romance and jealousy, old mind-sets and new friendships, as scintillating dialectical jousts in which verbal blows take the place of action and leave lasting emotional wounds.
55275|1|funny with bite
73966|0|Pure Country is an Elvis movie with a thick country twang.
72735|1|Zany, near surrealistic humor and good musical numbers make pleasant entertainment.
79497|0|An often interminable piece of work...
54946|1|A brave and incendiary if sometimes haphazardly constructed documentary... by no means a perfect film, but, bristling with contradiction and confrontation, it certainly is alive and -- like its subjects' too-early demise -- worthy of investigation.
81912|0|In our current polarized cultural climate, it seems there are fewer and fewer people for whom The Corporation is a wake up call.
38892|1|Thought-provoking and disturbing, this masterly thriller is directed with touches of sheer genius by Robert Siodmak.
61261|1|The many cliche elements in Physical Evidence are whipped into some semblance of new life.
77344|0|Prince follows his disastrous Under the Cherry Moon with another lame film.
40136|1|A bit syrupy, but sentimental teens may enjoy it.
99282|0|That we're now in such a safe sex cautionary era aside, turning a horny lecherous guy into Prince Charming is a tad more problematic than, say, transforming that mythic frog. A womanizer's guide to marital bliss.
44136|1|Cold, brutal, lonely; a modern world where the old codes of civilization and behavior no longer have a place.
69969|1|Hollywood soap opera at its best, nicely done and still entertaining after many decades.
16757|1|A series of strenuously oddball vignettes masquerading as a movie.

67998|1|[The filmmakers] capture the paradox of beauty and cruelty that charges their entire film. The Matador is rightly exciting -- and unsettling.

66806|0|The film is a bore.
49075|0|Love & Sex is nothing but pain and suffering.
31517|1|The young Catherine Deneuve (she was 22 at the time of filming) gives a performance so unsettling and so precise, I can barely believe she grew into such a confident screen presence.
3086|0|My main problem is that I found the girls a bore and likewise the pic.
85365|1|"The quadriplegic rugby sport referred to as ""Murderball"" is lovingly examined in a well-crafted documentary that goes a long way toward showing the mental and physical fortitude of these wheelchair bound athletes who insist on living life to the fullest."
48714|1|One of the most disturbing films I've ever seen.
27922|1|This glossy comedy's romantic heat never rises above an amiable simmer - but it's funny and charming nonetheless.
45505|1|Its intellectual intent and the physical production seem disconnected, leaving a film that bedazzles the eye even as it bedevils the mind.
86092|0|"Just Like Heaven"" perpetuates the Frisco curse that not one great movie has been made in the hilly city since Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo in 1958."
12062|0|It's the cumulative effect generated by mixing richly portentous imagery with absurdly portentous prose, starkly portentous sound and flatulently portentous music.
26655|1|It's a superficial but entertaining caper that's a good, old-fashioned yarn.
70227|0|[Who Framed Roger Rabbit] is better than this film in every qualifiable sense except it doesn't have a sex scene.
83752|0|[Looks like] a pilot for an east coast version of Baywatch.
33822|1|Hooper's film, despite its apparent focus on zoology, is really an experiment in baroque Texpressionism, dominated by concerns of an anthropological, ethnographic nature.
21627|0|This is like every other Hughes film, just a little shoddier.
77456|0|To call this immeasurably terrible movie 'stupid and nonsensical' would be an insult to stupid and nonsensical movies.
13172|1|Preserves a time when one could not only get away with making an allegory with an existential hero, but stock it with an ensemble from the Actors Studio. [Blu-Ray]
93978|1|Like Vittorio De Sica, one of the great Italian neo-realists, Kravchuk populates his film with people, not paradigms; his characters are capable of good and evil, sometimes in equal measure.
16480|1|A highly resonant testament to the redemptive power of love--one that transcends traditional romantic definitions.
62422|1|A lavish feast and the best family catch of the summer blockbuster season.
30866|0|Overly melodramatic.
6848|0|Aside from the sheer insanity of trying to leap into the shoes of the irreplaceable Phil Silvers, surely Martin should have recognized that the film had no script, no gags and no discernible point.
10309|1|Directed by England's pudgy master of melodrama, Alfred Hitchcock, Secret Agent is a first-rate sample of his knack of achieving speed by never hurrying, horror by concentrating on the prosaic.
78125|0|Generic at its core, the idea behind the movie is valiant enough but happy themes aren't enough to carry an otherwise boring film.
61565|1|A romantic comedy that is sexy without being gratuitous, funny without being crude, and mercifully free of on-screen Latino stereotypes such as chambermaids and troubled immigrants.
98262|0|I have to admit that not much about this movie made me laugh much at all.
57714|0|A Blair Witch-inspired mockumentary that, while based on a brilliant premise, is disappointingly bumpy nonetheless.
7156|1|Terry Southern's dialogue occasionally sparkles, and the imaginative designs, as shot by Claude Renoir, look really splendid.
79977|1|A sexually-charged Southern Gothic masterpiece that's monumentally underappreciated. One of Eastwood's and Siegel's best films.
9213|1|Hitchcock and screenwriter John Michael Hayes posited voyeuristic spectacle as the essence of cinema in Rear Window; in To Catch a Thief they validate their thesis with plenty of spectacle to be voyeuristic over.
64999|0|overblown paranoid crap based on same.
53797|0|Laconic and very stilted in its dialogue, this indie flick never found its audience, probably because it's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters.
49912|0|This biopic seemed about as amorphous as a junkie high.
99326|0|The film doesn't work, and indeed seems to have no clear idea of what its job is, and yet (sigh) there is the temptation to forgive its trespasses simply because it is utterly, if pointlessly, original.
17173|0|Staying home alone is definitely a better idea than seeing Home Alone 3.
6894|0|Instead of effervescent and mercurial, the movie is simply muddled. What happened?

40347|1|Unconditional love is a beautiful theory, Lonergan suggests, but putting it into practice can be exasperating.
16270|0|A movie that makes molasses look fast.
28436|1|It's basically a direct-to-video erotic thriller blown up to big-screen proportions, but the stars are attractive and it's passably entertaining -- right up to the ridiculous twist ending.
28918|0|We've been here before and it's been done better, much better.
73184|1|A cult film that deserves its reputation.
39641|1|Impressive debut film from Barker, though not quite the breakthrough film it was touted as being.
20426|0|Rubbishy religious tract of a horror flick tarted up as 'art.'

79399|1|Star-loaded film with innovative plot.
68062|1|When you get right down to it, Presumed Innocent is really just an elaborate version of the standard courtroom drama -- souped-up Perry Mason. On the other hand, this is as good as Perry Mason gets.

79204|1|Exciting formulaic war propaganda sea story.
51279|1|Like some manic slasher on the loose, Nic Roeg cuts compulsively, severing the natural arteries between cause and effect to expose a more irrational kind of narrative continuum...a true classic, worth looking at not just now but long into the future.
95657|1|A blatant attempt to cash in on the success of March of the Penguins, this wildlife documentary is stunningly photographed, but the attempts at anthropomorphism are frequently irritating.
63539|1|Dreamworks animation has a lot to live up to after Shrek, but this wacky and high-spirited version of the Sinbad legend really isn't too bad.
89240|0|More depressing than unfunny.
88462|0|Even in the visually arresting fat-suit Martin Lawrence extracts very few chuckles due to Don Rhymer's awful script and John Whitesell's flimsy direction.

11373|0|Com bons efeitos especiais de maquiagem e clímax tenso, o filme tem um bom final (raro para o gênero), apesar do roteiro frouxo.
18615|1|...a fast-paced thriller that probably will leave Alfred Hitchcock aficionados mourning its shallowness -- but not until after they've enjoyed an adrenaline rush.
19916|0|"And in the faint praise department: ""Halloween 4"" is just a little bit better than most of the sequels that followed."
7275|1|...aimed at early-teen girls, but it's got enough warmth and charisma to attract a wider audience.
90690|0|It's all so cliched in terms of personalities and full of such unbelievable situations that it's often downright laughable. And not in a good way.
86894|1|an unflinching and often terrifying look at a particularly insidious type of hate that has for too long flown under the radar of mainstream attention
8219|0|Chain Reaction is even dumber than Fled -- as hard as that may be to believe.
58161|1|Esta curiosa releitura do clássico de Robert Louis Stevenson conta com um visual impressionante e boas seqüências de ação. Ainda assim, está longe de se equiparar aos grandes clássicos da Disney.
56714|1|Take Care is nicely performed by a quintet of actresses, but nonetheless it drags during its 112-minute length.
5044|0|After the promisingly nasty beginning, the filmmakers settle into a sort of campaign mode, lulling and flattering the audience with a fairy-tale vision of the common man's victory over the Washington establishment.
4337|1|Among the movie's strengths are the performances, especially that of Ryder, who comes across as bright, beautiful and more delicate than ever before.
45840|0|Should be great; isn't.
5459|1|Brad Pitt's performance is crucial, and he rips into the character with a frightening sense of unhinged egomania, violently subverting the Redford-lite pretty-boy image with which so many wanted to associate him
97263|1|It left me highly entertained, since out of the original story the filmmakers have created a different, but exciting and tense story filled with action, suspense and a lead character you can truly care about.
54281|0|The preponderance of nudging innuendo was enough to earn the film a '12' certificate, thus excluding the audience of younger children who might otherwise have enjoyed the movie.
69342|0|Some dazzling acrobatic dance moves, but the story is pretty lame. The DVD, however, with quality extras, rates a B.
26494|1|very funny, very dark comedy/mystery
46482|0|The plot is ludicrous, which in itself would be perfectly acceptable given sharper handling, but both script and direction devote so much time to romantic undercurrents that the central intrigue is further divested of credibility.
68540|1|Naught but a torrid melodrama, but oh! what a humdinger of a melodrama it is! It's films like this that give trash a good name.
43814|1|For all its mainstream exertions, A Knight's Tale is actually something of an experimental melding of old and new.
23975|1|Amusing giant monster nonsense.
10674|1|That rare ghost story that fires on all cylinders: it's tremendously acted, sensationally photographed in deep-focus black and white, sumptuously produced and, best, genuinely frightening.
33012|1|Arguably the strongest American debut feature of the '90s.
62881|1|The film is a canny blend of observation and creation.
96480|1|Reservation Road, where the event central to this story takes place, is a symbolic crossroads for two families in this engaging drama about a hit and run accident and its aftermath.
25465|1|While Hitchcock's masterpiece is unquestionably the more mainstream and formally groundbreaking of the two films, it's arguable that Peeping Tom is the more thematically profound and insightful work. Just don't expect to feel good after watching it.
4093|0|If you spend the whole running time picturing Halle Berry nude on a sabertooth-tiger rug, The Flintonstones isn't so bad.
7529|0|Its appeal is mostly to an audience that can appreciate its gross-out camp humor and can overlook that it's a pointless exercise.
81695|1|A remarkable cultural document that captures the circus-like atmosphere and the raw and immediate quality of the performances.
94647|1|Julie Christie as an Alzheimer's afflicted wife achieves the perfect psychological mixture of despair, mystery, rebellion against the unappreciated devotion that has been her lot in married life, and an ultimate odd but eloquent personal liberation.
9938|0|It's so saccharine it's difficult to take seriously.
9233|0|Is the wedding cake outrageously expensive? Get over it, George.
46084|1|Scripters get credit for some terrific dialog that would have been a lot less disarming if not for the winsome robot and Sheedy's affection for it. Guttenberg plays his best goofy self.
43013|1|How fitting that the subtitle of this sequel is Island of Lost Dreams, for Rodriguez has let his vivid imagination run even more amok in waking, cinematic life.
96489|1|A good psychological and moral drama.
5816|1|A melancholy film exploring the despair and passion that arises from difficult situations.
38359|0|Harrison has devised a series of mini-dramas which he inserts, in intercut fashion, within the overall structure of the rave, and it's here that his effort fizzles.
27937|1|A small, poignant gem despite its laggardly pacing. Definitely an off-beat, side show attraction, but with three big rings of heart, character, and soul.
76812|0|Village idiot.
6225|0|'You like to watch don't you'... that may be true, but I would have liked watching even more if I were watching something better.
11918|1|The best of the original series, but the most intense, too.
10901|1|Stone's strongest suit, however, isn't so much realism as it is his way of blending immediacy and insight.
8270|0|A slapdash, overlong, and downright interminable endeavor...
87927|1|Tucker's screenplay is sharp but also sensitive, so the ample good humour never drifts into high camp (apart from the scenes with Bree's mother - and SHE is straight).
76751|1|Wonderful thriller as Milland tries to prove his innocence while Laughton plots to get away with murder.
77541|0|I can think of no compelling reason for anyone but a confirmed Bernie Mac fan wanting to watch it. I was already pretty much out of this ball game just a few innings in.
11289|0|It's particularly irritating if you've seen the much better Harvey.
42357|0|The whole enterprise is awash in a combined farcical obviousness and drippy sentimentality to induce more audience groans than laughs.
57607|0|Like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions.
55919|1|Shainberg sets up a restless quality in both characters, and he takes them very seriously but it still comes as a bit of shock to see what is normally considered to be sexist behavior finally and ultimately embraced.
73068|1|Its point is this: That every nation, like a family, is made up of many people who are often at odds with one another, but that ultimately, we are all one.
44855|0|The appeal will ... be restricted to art house audiences who don't mind people messing with their literary history.
78478|1|There is one thing that cannot be denied or ignored or downplayed: Jennifer Tilly gives every inch of herself to this movie.
25694|0|Lacks the depth of thought this complex topic deserves.
34395|1|Maybe the best film about teenagers ever made.
34361|1|Ron Shelton, who wrote and directed the film, displays a knowledge of and affection for the national pastime. You can see it in the knowing detail he brings to even the minor characters.
78847|1|The standard effects are used to their fullest, with Price accidentally reappearing at the wrong times and the proverbial floating gun that takes the guilty party by surprise.
56953|1|It's very slight and grows less interesting as Belushi's character is tamed, but it's a rare, welcome look a the late, great comedian's romantic side.
93321|1|A consistently entertaining and occasionally gut-wrenching tale that deserves at least some measure of notice.
100159|1|A bold effort to grapple with what truth lies behind these images, rather than to simply throw one's hands up in the face of them
54323|0|Although a comedy rife in lively characters, Wagons East! affords star John Candy one of the poorest, drabest, and thoroughly unfunniest roles of his career.
99769|1|Darkly funny morality tale for mature gore lovers.
38588|1|John Carradine as the mad scientist! Gene Wilder and the ewe! Tasteless, but funny; the sperm sequence is priceless.
54299|1|Not that bad, but seems a bit lost.
29368|1|Perhaps more than any other Chan movie, this one suggests that he's most at home being a clown.
96855|0|Ridley Scott forgets that editing is an art form as well
16587|1|Leigh may sound like a peculiar casting choice for a costume drama, but her trademark mannerisms and mumbly elocution are a perfect fit.
96540|1|Powerful portrait of an officer and his soldiers facing up to what it means to serve in an army of a fallible, democratic country that spins an explosive pyrrhic victory
54536|0|It excludes all life that is not within the very narrow intentions of its author. Its pores have been painted over.
95596|1|All dilutions aside, director Dahl mixes a dash of Six Feet Under with shots of Mr & Mrs Smith and Grosse Point Blank to put the kick into an enjoyably spiky little cocktail.
44899|0|More of the same...only less funny.
37746|1|Seductively lensed, sparely scripted and superbly performed, this does away with Gothic nonsense to offer a modern take on the undead myth.
27591|0|Forget all the ruinously expensive special effects. They're not worth a minute of your time, much less two hours of mind-boggling mediocrity.
49777|1|See? He's not JUST the Highlander!
523|1|It doesn't flinch from presenting the crime committed, and yet, it's a film that undoubtedly is against capital punishment.
52827|1|It's good to see Peter Bogdanovich working again, but his Hollywood tale feels like a minor, trashy TV melodrama
36676|0|Cohen, an experienced feature producer but first-time director, is hung up on superficial production values over substance.
56925|1|this is exactly the sort of movie I like to see.
94418|0|"The ""young man's post-traumatic discovery of life's value through quirky people tale"" is an obscure genre that's somehow attracted Zach Braff, Cameron Crowe and Jon Kasdan."
58229|1|The genius of Borat is all in Sacha Baron Cohen's daring, edgy, unrestrained performance.
23731|0|Devoid of enjoyment, intelligence or interest.
15183|1|Jennifer Lopez is outstanding as Selena, lending ability and grace to the stage numbers, in particular, but throughout the film, in general.
40719|1|Though it's set in urban New York, the jungle in this morality tale is similar to the one in Stone's former film, Platoon: In both, Charlie Sheen plays a youth torn between two father figures representing Good (Martin Sheen) and Evil (Michael Douglas)
78052|1|Roman Polanski is one of those men who, despite his icky treatment of women in real life, manages to create strong and compelling female characters for the screen.
55544|1|Balancing its frequently absurd humour with poignant observations of that time in life when you're not sure exactly what it is you're rebelling against, Igby Goes Down is an offbeat winner.
92537|1|In the obligatory boxing terms, Balboa will K.O. your expectations, but that may only be because they're rightfully below the belt to begin with--and because this sixth installment is coming after the bell has already rung.
10092|1|The fight sequences are explosive, the physical production is impressive, and the supporting performances are full of juice.
60321|0|Director Phillips confesses to frat membership in his youth, and even made a documentary on the subject. So why is this not funnier or more outrageous?
71378|1|Mad Dog and Glory is the kind of movie I like to see more than once.
29887|1|Cyril Raymond manages to invest the stodgy character with a lovable quality.
87122|0|... the first third of the film is marred by a tendency to be morbidly serious and overly dramatic.
44140|1|Parker pushes the picture along at a fervent clip, with the character scenes back-to-back with chases or violence.
97368|1|'Juno' is on some counts unrealistic and does not probe deeply, but it has undeniable charm.
27137|1|a lot of fun for fans of the science fiction and horror genres
96088|1|This is a movie about the very officials who boasted 'I don't do quagmires' (then-defense secretary Rumsfeld), but who hadn't actually done the planning or simple reading of other people's plans that might have avoided that very fate.
28032|1|Alive with the joy of filmmaking for its own sake.
7505|0|There isn't a shot, scene or sequence in The Rock that doesn't move furiously, typically with colored lights flashing into our faces or onto those of the actors.
540|1|This important film exposes the cruelty of death by lethal injection and shows that hate is the worst prison of all.
80940|0|I expect a certain number of contrivances in a baseball movie, especially one that's not meant to be taken seriously, but nothing prepared me for the sheer avalanche of formulas and cliches that fill the screen in Major League II.
61814|1|...the performances elevate a standard con game plot.
78145|1|a good film, but it is preaching to the converted
5999|1|Judd shines like the movie star she was destined to become.
75160|0|Abysmal, laugh-free and frequently offensive comedy whose one or two original ideas are completely overshadowed by smutty, puerile gags and a plot that's so insultingly sexist that you wonder if it's part of an elaborate prank.
56434|1|There is so much going on, filmed with such style, that I found it hard to stop being fascinated.
60805|1|This sports melodrama about a dying athlete is sentimental and predictable, but it's also very well acted by the young De Niro, Vincente Gardenia and Michael Moriarty.
8983|1|Too clumsy a thing to be taken seriously, with its romanticisation of slavery and its problematic approach to rape, Gone With The Wind is nevertheless a work of considerable power.
32415|1|It provides some fine artists the chance to stretch and frolic, even as it reminds today's audiences of animation's limitless borders.
21798|1|The real creative opportunities lie in visual and choreographic options, and Haines doesn't miss a beat in either department.
79586|1|One watches -- and, perhaps more importantly, hears -- the modern world through his rendering of emotion, architecture, chaos, boredom, silence, and incommunicability.
67666|1|Stagey, but pleasant star vehicle
40187|1|Vampire cows provide comic relief and many of the scares in this respectfully dark yet optimistic story about a lonely child who befriends a vampire.
33344|1|This film is sometimes too familiar, especially in early scenes that deliberately repeat the first film's gags. But the formula isn't tired yet.
34134|1|Jarmusch's original film, which deconstructs the mobster genre as seen through the eyes of a Samurai, is by turn eccentric, mysterious, and mythical, defying viewers expectations
92996|0|The sub-sub-Anaconda bottom-feeder Primeval makes the mistake of taking itself far too seriously; with its exploitative images of civil war and genocide, it's the Blood Diamond of 25-foot-killer-crocodile movies.
98236|0|If only there was some nobility among these royals.
64442|0|Suitable entertainment for boys too young to shave.
54164|0|Too much of Minority Report is facile, albeit at a very high level.
24193|0|...Berg's listless direction brings the film so little point of view that it doesn't much matter who lives or dies.
56406|0|Putting the faces of hot young stars on the same old parts doesn't make the movie any fresher.
13089|1|It's Scott's virtuoso performance that carries the film.
51831|1|...A gripping, fast-moving film that will be added to the short list of quality movies focused on the U.S. conflict in Vietnam.
79510|1|A thoroughly absorbing affair.

41883|0|Incomprehensible.
22450|1|Mossy intrigue jolted by Hitchcock's style and delirium
26940|0|The often silly elements of the plot dilute the majesty of the Chinese culture which it traverses, and the childish nature of the magical elements dilute the film's appeal outside a narrow target audience of undemanding kids
24780|0|Although you could certainly do much worse, there is only one really distinctive quality about the film, and that is Charlize Theron's charismatic performance.
39482|0|...at nearly two hours, it's just too much of a good thing.
28262|1|In exaggerating Nixon's mannerisms, Hedaya has created the year's funniest film caricature.
3032|1|It must be nice to be able to spend $8-million to fulfil your childhood fantasies. George Lucas has that much money because of the tremendous success of his last movie, American Graffiti, and he spent it both wisely and well on Star Wars.
31660|0|But while the film tilts progressively further towards the chick-flick (most notably with a cliché-of-clichés trying-on-dresses-to-music scene), some witty moments make this a high-living title in a low-rent market.
24046|0|The humour throughout is alternately mindless, sexist, racist, and homophobic, and would probably offend if you managed to stay awake.
51829|0|Mais uma patriotada que mostra os americanos matando milhares de vietcongues, mas sendo mais 'humanos' que os inimigos.
100583|1|Gleefully brimming with body parts and bad behavior, Pathology is a fun piece of flamboyant tastelessness.
47278|1|Fun & gay, literally, based on hit Broadway show.
64756|1|Ash Wednesday is not Edward Burns' best film, but it is a good and ambitious film. And it marks him as one of the most interesting writer/directors working today.
47252|1|While the rest of it isn't really any good, it's certainly no chore to watch.
47389|1|The sound effects editors and cinematographer ... had a field day with this film.
58550|0|'Carente de imaginación, mal dirigida, peor actuada y sin un ápice de romance, es una verdadera pérdida de tiempo y dinero'
42833|0|This gridiron comedy piles up cliches the way Notre Dame racks up yardage, with an option-variety screenplay that promiscuously pitches the story in multiple directions.
18514|0|Pic serves up a sensory overload without any compensatory reflection on the outlandish and irresponsible behavior on view.
39141|1|Lee Marvin clearly steals the film in his double role as the good guy/bad guy hired gunman.
74364|1|An acquired taste, but for those who are big fans of challenging, chaotic new wave French cinema go wild.
47651|1|Both poignant and outrageously funny.
17391|0|The film is almost unbearable.
47976|0|The Glass House es una cinta de suspenso que conjunta un buen elenco, pero por desgracia el guión cae en lo ilógico en varias ocasiones.
4616|1|Scorsese's remake (also hommage in some ways) is inferior to the original 1962 version, though the acting is good, and both Robert De Niro and Juliette Lewis garnered Oscar nominations.
67774|1|This was Falconetti's only major film and over a period of a year under Dreyer's direction (a combination of cruelty and patience), her extraordinarily expressive face made for one of the greatest, most harrowing screen performances.
81775|1|Sure to push the buttons of anyone with a shark phobia.
19858|0|Not even remotely scary, and on top of that less than 1/3 of the film takes place in New York. False advertising, I say!
49764|1|L'humour est raffiné et subtil, le scénario est bien construit et rempli d'invraisemblances que l'on ne prend jamais au sérieux.
9015|1|...They rate a nod for daring, as well as credit for an all-around filmmaking job that, disregarding the unpleasant subject matter, is a standout.
66258|1|Surprisingly funny.
62513|0|It's a pretty bold move to make a film for groups of young males about the latent sexual nature of the relationships in such groups - and this alone made 2 Fast, 2 Furious an unexpectedly hilarious treat.
18698|0|The result is a perfectly safe film for living in a totalitarian country.
40121|1|Decent enough entertainment as written, though many will regret the movie's eleventh-hour detour into pieties.
29146|0|Still, the movie is pretty bad. It's Rush Hour meets 48 Hours meets Bad Boys except this time around there's only one bad boy and the script and direction are subpar.
38681|1|A flamboyant, theatrical, speculative and goofy film about a reckless, chaste, tragic love affair, one that's only-but also gloriously-fit for the movies.

83739|1|Not exactly a horror film, at least by any strict definition. But it is a great deal of fun.
61885|0|...scene after scene of flirt, tease, posture, preen, rebuff. I've seen animal shows on Discovery that present their subject material with less clinical detachment.

77076|0|carves out its own niche by combining the Christian horror of the original with the cruelties and crassness of colonialism.
33154|0|The most notable aspect of this trashy (but unenjoyable) biopic of Jacquleine Susann, Valley of the Doll's best-selling author, is its running time (93 minutes); Bette Midler and Nathan Lane give two of their worst and broadest performances.
92757|0|Buddies Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney started out so well. But The Good German is so painful that their recent decision to go their separate ways really merits a gospel choir.
40279|1|The decision to shift some of the attention to De Niro's character...dilutes the power of Brashear's fascinating life story.
48288|1|A spectacular adventure story with a smidgin of romance, King Solomon's Mines is exciting enough and adventurous enough and wholesome enough for the whole family.
19150|1|"Franklin Roosevelt, who loved the movie, put pressure on MGM to release the film earlier than planned, but playwright Lillian Hellman told director Wyler, ""Willie you have made a piece of crap."" Even so, the film won Best Picture Oscar."

27796|1|A fair and admirable comedy we haven't quite seen before.
19049|0|A loose collection of unfortunate events strung together to make a feature film sadly lacking a coherent theme.
6992|0|Neither jokes nor fast, flashy action can completely distract audiences from the failure to establish an authentic, rather than a purely conventional connection between Nolte and Murphy.
90240|1|Enjoyable whether you're a fan of the music or not.
94818|1|Off-planet strangeness with a captivation factor.
22836|0|A disappointment.
72359|1|For a thorough overview of film history and the art behind films ... can be no better guide than Martin Scorsese
40072|1|Though well-crafted, this potboiler is a second-tier film noir, mostly known for featuring Kirk Douglas screen debut, as Stanwyck's weakling hubby; in a few years, Douglas will develop his more characteristic persona as a tough, tenacious he-man.
12746|1|The Bridge on the River Kwai is David Lean's last film not to succumb to bloat.
31554|1|As beneficial as helmer's influence may be to that aging franchise, his work here reps a fascinating use of the docu form.
81849|1|A mature, significant contribution to the unfornately growing trend of films that address teen violence (unfortunate in that we need the trend at all).

26980|0|The film is best when it takes itself seriously, worst when it takes the easy way out in giggly camp -- as it does, finally and fatally, when Lex Luthor enters the action.
82639|1|"Despite being based on an exceptional true-life story, Bronwen Hughes' ""Stander"" is uneven and somewhat sloppy in execution.**"
72677|0|Fraser, O'Donnell, Damon and Affleck would all go on to have much hyped careers, and occasionally make better films than this overbearingly worthy classroom drama.
68059|0|Conscientiously as this movie has been made, it does not work as well as the novel did or as some of Pakula's other films have.
61714|1|Even if you have never heard a Wilco album, the film is a great introduction to the band's music and the pain that goes into making it.
101091|1|If it doesn't succeed in challenging you perception of the war on terror, it might challenge your view on Steve Martin.
56096|0|Seeing as I'm a 31-year-old Jewish cynic from Philadelphia, it's plainly obvious that I am not the intended audience for Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie. But I know a feature-length advertisement when I see one.
93272|0|Murphy finally has nothing to prove in front of the camera, which makes his fondness for wearing extreme prosthetics to play multiple roles in a film bursting with cheap, obvious gags increasingly baffling.
8382|1|An entertaining gay comedy of errors from Germany who's main asset is the attractive Til Schweiger.

78775|0|hasn't aged very well
39564|1|...it's always a pleasure to watch this ensemble of gifted talents do what they do best -- be spontaneous and funny and surprising. What we get is a master-class demonstration of the distinction between comic actors and comedians who try to act.
28773|1|In its exploration of the moral dilemma of the undercover life, In Too Deep breaks no ground. But Epps is a leading man on the rise, and Cool J is something to see.
87809|1|Faustian bargain with a goddess. Huge armies march. Men out-race the wind. Assassins make devious plots. Spectacular scenes generated largely in computers.
63591|1|Actor Ramos brings an extraordinary intensity and focus to this contradictory role, changing emotions and actions on a dime.
17908|1|This film noir in color benefits from Hathaway's taut direction, strong performances of Monroe as the adulterous wife and Cotten as the jealous hubby, and location shooting.
88370|1|The film has an immeasurable fascination that makes us look on as voyeurs and wonder how we might have reacted during such desperate times.
64728|1|A movie that can be trying at times but is ultimately satisfying to watch.

102112|1|What a pleasant surprise to discover that the film has earned its sweeping title.
1348|1|In the film's most extraordinary discovery, we see the only existing film footage of Anne Frank, taken one day in 1941, before the Franks went into hiding.
28998|1|Stir kept me interested the entire time, but it was bit predictable.
2334|0|Once the premise has lost its promise, and Fiennes's brave attempts at characterization are sacrificed to pseudo-dazzle, everything appears awfully humdrum and, yes, distinctly dated.
60082|1|Much of the rest of Daredevil is so dark that you can't see it. I don't think you're missing a great deal.
99519|1|There's a note of mourning in this otherwise celebratory film -- for punk rock, for New York, for reality, for a time when popular music was animated by something other than money.
56795|1|It holds up beautifully, mainly because it puts the characters and their flaws first and the disco nightlife second. Travolta remains an amazing, graceful presence on the dance floor.
16658|0|Impressive ambitions that fail at every turn. Ewan's really quite uncharacteristically dreadful.
42695|0|It's difficult to accept these trained SEALs as anything more than a species of Dirty Dozen.
16672|1|The film, directed by Norman Jewison, feels a bit too simple for such a complex story, but Washington transcends the problems to provide his best acting since Malcolm X.
55928|1|A great feature film with enough laughs, weirdness, fine performances and filmmaking flair to earn it a place on most critics' top ten of the year lists.
31708|1|Stunning masterpiece about poverty in California is still relevant today
47801|0|Harmless enough, but so condescendingly saccharine, you might gag on it.
66902|1|A moving but gritty story of willpower and sacrifice that stops pleasingly short of a Hollywood varnish-job.
83844|1|Elevator to the Gallows is a treat for the film buff. Watching Moreau and Malle as they discover each other and a new trend in filmmaking, and listening to Miles Davis during their quest will remind you of what movies are all about.
10180|1|A fun adventure that always seems to get mixed up in my memory with Mary Poppins, and while they share similarities, this one stands out on its own as a great childrens film.
7334|1|A fantastic science fiction comedy
18849|1|An unrushed journey, a loose summing up but not a dreary final testament, through a director's history, conducted by the filmmaker himself.
57175|1|Only When I Laugh is a film about family ties, friendship and coping in a competitive world.
95840|0|Desperately unfunny, badly written sequel that's essentially a mish-mash of tired cliches, fart gags and genuinely terrible performances. One to avoid.
80119|1|With its two peerless leads delivering riveting performances, this snapshot of the landscape of early 1970s America - external and internal - is a fine entry into the road movie canon.
25246|1|Dougherty interweaves the different strands of his narrative with a healthy disinterest in the norms of chronology, and so introduces just the right amount of jigsaw-like tricksiness to keep his penny-dreadful treat smelling fresh
10997|1|...the most effective big-screen translation of a Mamet stage play.
7548|0|Effects apart, this is dire: predictable, clichéd, sloppily written, pitifully performed and surprisingly short of real shocks and suspense.
71466|1|A quirky, amusing little film.
58703|0|Martin Scorsese has landed back onto UK cinema screens with a resoundingly hollow thump.
31045|1|There's no denying its snappiness. Whenever you shut your brain off, it hums amicably right along.
66931|0|Elegantly shot but poorly assembled, Campion's fractured film [has] . . . a lot of vivid blood and guts, but no head and brains to control the flow of passion.
84717|0|Pretty slow and predictable, and filled with soap opera-like plot contrivances.
50547|1|A delightfully eclectic piece of filmmaking.
63584|1|Is this a mystery thriller or a very slow comedy? Whatever it is, the two lead actresses make the task of finding out delectable.
88307|0|An essentially toothless affair, poking fun at American imperialism and its attendant cluelessness while never illuminating much beyond the obvious.
27411|1|If only the film had taken a few more risks instead of hewing so closely to the patented Disney formula, it might have been a truly outstanding movie instead of merely an entertaining one.
40855|1|Lickety-split banter between brilliantly conceived characters, chase scenes that leave you breathless with laughter and surprise ... this is a whole new ballgame for Disney.
60214|1|A beautifully moving film.
51684|1|Es una de esas películas de las que uno sale reconfortado, agradecido, genuinamente sorprendido.
58643|1|Shot in rich, shadowy black-and-white, Devils chronicles, with increasingly amused irony, the relationship between reluctant captors and befuddled captives.
38996|0|Hamstrung by a script that is too often smug, obvious and self-important -- all qualities that Waters used to lampoon mercilessly.
80392|1|The result is a disturbing movie about hope and disappointment.
10957|0|While it has its moments, taken by itself, The Doors amounts to little more than an impressionistic look at a boy and his death wish.
14357|1|Cameron Crowe's romantic comedy is well acted by Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. (in an Oscar-winning turn), but as a tale of redemption, the movie is not too deep and goes out of its way to satisfy viewers' expectations of a happy ending.
59503|0|Perhaps you can't cheat death in Final Destination 2, but apparently you can kill originality.
3587|1|I have not read Stephen King's novella (his first non-horror), but some of the movie's deficiencies, such as the old-fashioned morality tale and portentous messge about camarderie and redemption--must have been in the source material.
92312|1|Weaver and Rickman and screenwriter Angela Pell elevate the film into something quite endearing.
28622|0|The problem is not so much the child. The problem is the movie, one which is, in its own way, amazing. Why was it made? Who made it? Do they have children? Would they want them to see this thing?
28544|1|Airplane! is a splendidly tacky, totally tasteless, completely insignificant flight, a gooney bird of a movie that looks as if it could never get off the ground and then surprises and delights with its free-spirited aerobatics.
5351|0|For this they needed three screenwriters?
45520|1|The film's intriguing perversity compensates for the excesses of its plot and presentation.
84896|0|There are two ways to look at the big-screen adaptation of The Honeymooners - as an adaptation of the show, and as a film in it's own right. Either way it's a film that occasionally works, but never manages more than that.
53345|0|Scott Kalvert's attempt at a gangster picture is the worst film of 2002.
87036|0|Abrahams and Streep simply steal a movie dominated by two less interesting characters.
27162|1|classic, though it didn't impress me really that much
31792|0|Under the direction of Adrian Lyne, most of the picture's situations seem like randomly chosen place holders, flat events that just fill time until the final bizarre confrontation.
64208|1|A deliberately provocative film that triggers the audience's emotions in order to highlight important issues of personal freedom. Amen to that.
15055|1|Children of Men is so boldly told, so thought out, so infused with the joy of filmmaking, that it's absolutely exhilarating. It's one of the best movies of the past year.
26512|1|This audacious movie may put some people to sleep; for others, it'll be a wakeup call on the possibilities of screen storytelling
35147|0|One more nail in the coffin of the 60s.
90388|1|No doubt one of the weirdest, most off-beat movies you can see all year, and with a rocking soundtrack.
64836|1|A fine documentary exploring the use of curiosity and creativity in the lives and work of seven scientists.
5697|1|Thanks to David Thewlis' performance, which has been collecting prizes since last spring's Cannes Film Festival, Johnny's energy and ferocious wit outweigh his brutishness.
94766|1|Largely an improvement over its predecessor, this is a decent attempt at bringing the FF's adventures to the big screen, but still a few fixes away from truly being fantastic.
98866|0|...the promised adventure never quite materializes.
98601|0|Even movies that dare to paint dark portraits of the sacred institution can't resist glorifying it in the end.
49917|1|God is jealous of Benjamin Bratt, but He's coming around...Bratt's performance [here] is electrifying and charismatic.
91760|0|The sepia-toned freeze frames that introduce each character with their names, occupations and life expectancy are a lot of fun, but ultimately the action is cut too fast and too close to be able to tell what's going on.
5753|0|Not up to Rob Reiner's usually high standard.
40264|0|This film is pretty much stupid from start to finish, although there are occasions when one is unable to stifle an embarrassed chuckle.
20768|0|David Lean's 1965 adaptation of Pasternak's romance of the Russian Revolution is intelligent and handsomely mounted, though it doesn't use its length to build to a particularly complex emotional effect.
31630|1|It's got Bill Murray, and that's always a good thing.
39448|1|Delivers considerably more than the premise promises.
29437|1|An excellent ensemble effort.
57120|1|Ms. 45 is not a feminist revenge film. It is, however, an intelligent and confident piece of exploitation filmmaking marinated in helplessness and anger ...

30657|0|Even James Bond can miss his mark.
67873|1|Sharply written and extremely well-acted, Allen's serio-comic ensemble-driven saga about one large neurotic family, a huge artistic and commercial hit at the time, is arguably his last great picture.
56574|0|After seeing SWEPT AWAY, I feel sorry for Madonna.
89289|1|Takes a comical look at the ratings board and its nefarious activities in giving a film a rating.
16588|1|The Hungarian angle gives the film a little distinctiveness.
81510|1|Blends romance, mystery and fantasy to beguiling, if slightly bewildering, effect.
89312|1|A light urban coming-of-age dramedy where the veneer may be darkly intriguing, but the finish is pure homily, of the sort where lessons are learned and dreams do come true.
31016|1|Criminally underseen yet solid gold.
45059|1|In one of his last (good) Westerns, John Ford draws even more explicitly the contrast between charismatic and legal authority, between the Wilderness of the West (John Wayne) and the values of the Civilization (Jimmy Stewart, from the East).
64349|1|Seen as a Catholic-Marxist statement at the time, nearly 40 years on, Pasolini's cinematic accomplishment still impresses.

45282|1|This is the movie not the perfume; its smell is not quite as captivating.
82080|1|Easily bearing comparison with Bruce Brown's seminal The Endless Summer, this stands as the second-best surf documentary ever made.
95997|1|a sometimes hilarious, sometimes eye-goggling reductio ad absurdum of the action flick to its barest kinetic essentials - like one of those porn compilations of money shots, only in a different genre.

32085|1|A profoundly generous treatise on how men and women misunderstand and torment one another.
80190|1|Not the unsubtle 'what' he is saying in 'The Holy Mountain,' but the individualized 'how,' is filmmaker Jodorowsky's strength.
100584|0|Existing somewhere in a world between Flatliners, Saw and Last Tango in Paris, this oversexed, over the top, underwritten medical horror flick won't come anywhere near the success of those films.
86587|1|A fascinating trip to the dark ages and a good story well told
101798|1|It's hamstrung by both underdeveloped plot strands and overdeveloped visual style, but it still works in its own way, plowing through potential criticisms much like its titular gridiron hero plowed through tacklers.
91009|1|I never thought I'd get choked up over a movie about the stuffy upper-crust of the British monarchy, but then along came The Queen.
41508|1|Ultimately Mike Newell manages to make the film into something worthwhile.
84736|1|It will sweep you off your feet.
94190|1|An unremarkable revenge/chase western, bolstered by its name cast, matter-of-fact violence and Toll's pristine photography. Eventually a little pretentious - with Anjelica Huston's cameo the nadir - but if you love oaters, it's just worth the time.
56846|0|In an attempt to follow National Lampoon, it was the first and only film produced by MAD Magazine. One viewing reveals why.
54598|0|Eight Legged Freaks clearly wants to be a Gremlins for the 21st century, but never quite makes it due to lackluster character development and shaky pacing.

92824|1|Sure, it's earnest -- sure, it's melodramatic. Yup, it's just barely this side of being a made-for-Lifetime TV soaper. But there's a mesmerizing power to this little film that comes from its sheer un-told-ness, from its right-now immediacy.

37523|1|This middle portion of the picture becomes dangerously preachy, but just before we and Max are bored, director Miller returns Max to his roots, a screaming chase sequence through a desertlike Australian landscape.
68521|1|"""Taylor at her most fetching"""
56073|0|I keep renting Jean Reno films and I'm beginning to forget why I started doing so.
18473|0|"A great popcorn movie doesn't have to be well-constructed, all it has to do is to thoroughly entertain you for 2 hours -- ""Godzilla"" doesn't do that."
53177|0|Every now and again, a movie comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be. Frank McKlusky C.I. is that movie!
28954|1|Yes. A war zone can be fun for restless teens with hot blood and a passion for mischief.
97783|0|For all the would-be with-it cyber/techno-speak, strip that all away, and Gregory Hoblit's film is completely stale and cliched thriller nonsense.
59792|1|A hybrid musical romantic fantasy, lavishing giddy heights of visual imagination and technical brilliance onto a wafer-thin story of true love turned sour, then sweet.
46620|1|The movie keeps viewers at the edge of their seats thanks to its propulsive score ... and realistic, practical special effects
61416|0|While this would have made an incredible 45-minute short, the film tries to cover too much territory, being diverted by its subplots.
83010|0|Dakota Fanning does the creepy child routine quite effectively. DeNiro, on the other hand, barely breaks a sweat.
43130|0|More Tom and Jerry than Thelma and Louise.
63536|1|It's a decent summer distraction for restless little ones, but not much more.
25767|1|Great Stephen King movie. Some true scares, lots of gore, and a hint of morality. Are you responsible for the reanimated dead?
41039|1|Everyone who has the capacity for abstract thought, raise your hands . . . and take this Coen brothers' journey.
54161|0|This may be Cruise's most puzzling and disappointing head-scratcher since the original Mission: Impossible.
45162|1|The most haunting death story in the movies, exquisitely photographed, like a reverie just before the afterlife.
47850|1|In spite of that condescension, it's still fascinating to watch these men keep the disco peace.
91472|1|Produces nightmarish horror and formal beauty in a surreal, Central European blend.
26614|1|Brave moviegoers and fans of writer-director David Cronenberg will find funny dialogue and grotesquely engrossing scenes in his latest sci-fi horror tale.
16966|1|Peter Weir's film is so cleverly conceived and brilliantly executed that it almost seems like a fresh thought. And even if it doesn't, it nevertheless forms the basis of a very witty exercise.
19325|1|Superb movie of More's stand against Henry VIII.
74701|1|An okay remake of the better LA FEMME NIKITA. Captures the spirit, but not the intensity.
77936|0|"A sanitized version of ""Fame"" for the pre-teen set"
36176|0|The film covers the main events of the Orton life in a manner that is nothing less than distracted. One has little understanding of the fatal intensity - and need - that kept Orton and Halliwell together.
1839|0|Feels as if the picture were edited to leave the action sequences in while removing any connecting material that might have helped them make sense.
39983|0|Any criticism of a film like The Ladies Man is essentially moot.
28170|1|The film looks superb from start to finish, the acting is almost universally top notch ... and Morricone's score is a fine accompaniment to Joffé's passionate, heartfelt vision.
63808|0|Despite its virtues, the picture comes across rather like something that has itself been disinterred from the fairly remote past.
37313|1|More violence and Clint-itude in Italian Western.
39626|0|Will someone please make me a great football movie?
101702|1|Ethics is at the heart of this David and Goliath story based on fact; a powerful story with a resonant emotional punch, but the storytelling is long winded with an emphasis on detail for detail's sake
34595|0|[Settles] into the quick-react rhythm of modern sitcoms.
28310|1|Like Kieslowski and others, Shyamalan knows that what makes for lousy metaphysics can make for powerful metaphor, and in the end he creates a deeply, surprisingly affecting film out of a little bit of smoke and brimstone.
23342|0|Major junk!
40747|1|The film has a purposefully repellent but fascinating quality. Bogosian`s performance, based on his stage play, is spectacularly demented.
25692|0|Not only is the film way too long, but it often comes across as extremely haphazard with many scenes seeming too random, unattached to the greater picture and/or orphaned midstream.
47026|0|The rather mechanical style of director Roger Spottiwoode (who took over the film after original director Henry Winkler departed) fails to enliven the stereotypical criminal proceedings.
78940|0|Like its cinematically superior inspiration, Celsius 41.11 isn't going to change many minds.
6451|1|Revolves around a diligent northern Italian school teacher and his attempts to do his job well.
80023|1|Alejandro Jodorowsky may be full of it, but I'm thankful that he spread it -- whatever it is -- across the screen in 'El Topo.'
13133|1|Un film qui plaira autant aux fans du genre manga qu'à ses détracteurs.
60383|0|This film seems destined to join the ranks of such 'classics' as Showgirls, Rock Star, and other debacles that are so atrociously campy that they end up being fun to watch.
34921|1|Decent collection of the fine work of Aardman Animation. The Oscar-winning title film is the best of the bunch
7036|1|Another superb stop-action animated film from the same team responsible for Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas.
796|1|Holland may have been a failed composer, but he's a master at playing the heartstrings.
19692|1|Hughes may deserve more plaudits as a social worker than a filmmaker, but you have to admit his hokey situation plays. The reason is the five terrific young actors, who bring more conviction to these parts than they perhaps deserve.
1785|0|Moore's only non-docu is a misfire, a diffuse, unfunny political satire that only John Candy's most avid fans might enjoy.
53211|1|Repellent yet intriguing, brutal yet funny, wicked yet strangely compassionate, The Salton Sea is more about mixing genres and styles than illuminating a credible reality.
95069|1|The appalling sausage factory that produces what we see on network TV is nicely skewered in The TV Set, an engaging if not exactly edgy comedy that exists to restate the obvious.
97199|1|Storyline was laid out well. There were a few scenes where you find yourself laughing at the movie, but overall it was a decent thriller.
9422|1|Sweeping saga of American prosperity that reveals its racist underbelly; glorious star vehicle that upends rigid gender roles; modern western that questions the validity of frontier land ownership.
25594|0|The most unfortunate thing about Jawbreaker has to be its blatant imitation of 1989's vastly superior Heathers.
81788|0|A cute, ineffectual film that breaks absolutely no new ground but enjoys itself as it skips down the familiar paths.
70448|0|Ocean's Eleven goes to high school and flunks out in a dumbed-down caper film.
73809|1|D.A. Pennebaker's great concert film.
95480|0|Hie me to the vomitorium, it's a fantastically smug and boring movie about food and romance, pumped with artificial sweeteners.
56451|0|In the end, Tuck Everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived: too much to do, too little time to do it in.
101168|1|August Evening creates a complete world, with all of its practical limitations and emotional possibilities, for Jaime and Lupe to hunt for their place in.
59703|0|Weighted with moments of surprising power yet undone by crazed-crank nickelodeon pacing.
92487|1|Although it is a marked improvement on the original film, it's still a bit of a snooze, relying too much on forced comedy and not enough on suspense or fright.
59002|1|Does a respectable job of retelling as much of Dickens’ tale as possible in the time alloted.
82389|1|The text is wonderful, Radford's film has some fine performances from Jeremy Irons and Joseph Fiennes, and he makes good use of Venice locations.
35574|1|It's mostly Wayne all the way. He towers over everything in the film.
66941|0|While most movies insist on having 'plots,' this one boldly proceeds without one, flying in the face of convention.
47186|1|"A classic slice of horror! ""bloody"" good fun!"
83430|1|A grim and less than subtle anti-war piece that doesn't tell us anything we didn't know, but does make it more visual and therefore more immediate than many might wish to see.
47340|1|As the puzzle interlocks, the composite truth is terrifying. A second horseman of social collapse is pounding towards us--peak oil.
21264|1|While 'The Temple of Doom' is a bit gloomy, puts children in danger, and confines its action primarily to one spot, it's still quite entertaining. (Blu-ray edition)
100329|0|For all its virtues as a coming-of-age study, it's too slow, too single dimensional to create much of a stir beyond arthouse and hothouse interest. The close-ups of Acquart's classic beauty are well worth the screen time, however.
98744|0|This is the perfect example of what can happen when a producer/director/writer doesn't have to answer to anyone. Coppola makes an artistic mess.
69863|0|Don't look now, but as you might expect with message-mad Kramer at the helm of this adaptation of Katherine Anne Porter's novel, there's a heavy allegory aboard.
70567|1|With only modest expectations in mind, this dysfunction-palooza turns out to be a loosely knit, affable enough treat.
22023|0|The movie is more interesting than achieved: it's the most forthright statement of the transference theme in Hitchcock's work, but it's also the least nuanced.
25961|0|[It] seems reluctant to use the potentials for astute comic strip philosophy that all the other films revelled in to a greater or lesser extent.
43790|0|One of film's greatest dissapointments.
62969|1|A superior noirish thriller which gets right under the skin of the seedy world it inhabits.
78669|1|Owen and Portman give excellent, committed performances, leaving Law and Roberts in the shade.
30715|1|This outrageous comic fantasy may not sustain its brilliance throughout its 112 minutes, but it keeps cooking for so much of that time that I don't have many complaints.
11403|0|Auteil's Ugolin is so well drawn, it's a shame to see the role lost.
31200|1|As the twists come thick and fast and the plot gets progressively more and more baroque, Branagh shows himself to be at least as intelligent as Brian De Palma in delivering over-the-top stylistic filigree.
56268|1|"Good but far from great sequel to Bogdanovich's ""Last Picture Show."""
26087|0|One of the most kitschy adaptation of a video game to film, and one of the biggest box office failures ever. [Full review in Spanish]
73329|0|Tremors 3 is somewhat entertaining, but only in a I-really-want-like-this-movie-because-it's-Tremors-for-pete's-sake kind of way.
36925|1|A genuinely creepy thriller, humble in scope and lacking some polish, but executed with ghoulish intuition.
25263|1|Still Penny Marshall's least annoying movie
10857|1|The fun of Dial M lies in its duel of wits...
48897|1|In spite of its faults, Lurie's film cannot be easily dismissed.
101931|1|Lord of War has a surreal edge, despite being enmeshed in world events, with absurdity and dark humor laced throughout.
28823|1|It's apparent that Lang was enjoying himself on this production, and the fact that he returned to the genre forty years later is also telling.
50049|1|A stark and haunting study of marital discord.
11460|1|How could you not like a film which features Harvey Fierstein as a moyl with two-pierced ears? You simply can't.
72704|1|"From first scene to the unforgettable final sting, ""Raising Cain"" is hypnotic in its richly devised spell, starkly realistic fears invaded by haunting spurts of dream logic."

7753|1|Funny, disturbing, tragic and deeply addictive.
23418|1|Audiences will be laughing hysterically while crying their eyes out.
23702|0|Oz's toothless vehicle is never able to capture the dark humor of its calculated convictions...has no apparent rhyme or reason to its meandering madness
42248|1|A small tale with enormous emotional clout.
81353|1|anatomises a moment in time when smalltown idiocy suffers the most surreally awful repercussions of cause and effect.
4969|0|Take away the mountains and what you have is a howlingly bad action film with a cornball villain out to steal a massive amount of United States currency from federal agents.
8784|1|As buoyant and elegant as bubbles in a glass of champagne, Frank Capra's sublime 1934 comedy... survives triumphantly because of its wit, charm, romantic idealism and its shrewd sketch of married life.
8800|1|Soaked in paranoia, Cukor's superb pyschological thriller is a period film noir, just like Hitchcock's The Lodger and Hanover Square, both set in the Edwardian age.
53909|1|Efficient set pieces come neatly spaced every ten to 15 minutes -- just often enough to keep you credulous -- and the trans-European settings lend a classy backdrop.
101309|1|Not just a showcase for motifs that Bergman would use to create masterpieces later; it's a great film all by itself.
63515|0|No original, Whiterspoon realizou a proeza de converter uma personagem irritante em uma figura carismática. Mas, desta vez, não houve como evitar: Elle Woods é mesmo um porre.
85373|1|A leftfield sports documentary that's as insightful and thought-provoking as it is fast and furious.
80286|1|By the time Sorcerer gets around to its rain-soaked, rickety-bridge set piece, you'll either be obsessed or fully checked out. Give yourself a chance to pick sides.
28230|1|Jessica Lange is mesmerising in this uneven biopic of the spirited, politically outspoken 1930s actress Frances Farmer.
79693|1|About as good as any sci-fi adventure film of that generation.
44459|0|Despite some good work from Bacall and Monroe, this comedy ends up feeling flat. How many people want to watch a movie with a bunch of selfish women who want to find a rich husband so they don't ever have to work again? Yeah, I didn't think so.
89537|1|Kinky Boots is a rare and unassuming tale about everyday folk, or shall I say blokes, who climb out of their comfort zones to change their lives for the better without the help of Richard Simmons or Tony Robbins.
85154|1|Extremely clever social satire buried in a rip-roaring action movie that isn't afraid to get squirm-inducingly gruesome.
2873|0|Waste of Phil Hartman and Sinbad
55180|0|Frankly, it's kind of insulting, both to men and women. And it's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting.
73080|1|Jitnukul can direct action, and every slice of the blade, thwack of the arrow and the glistening of sweat on near-naked bodies makes Bang Rajan a mostly pleasurable diversion.
91417|1|Despite the occasional mixed message and overwrought moment, Gridiron Gang is a sincere, moving film about a worthwhile subject
67701|1|In Funny Games, Haneke seems content to ram his thumbs into our eyes and then ask us why we were foolish enough to get within arm's length of his gray, grizzled visage.
101682|1|(...) Hay un mérito atendible en la directora y es evitar caer en la sensiblería barata que el asunto arriesgaba.
45895|0|...the majority of Lady in White's horror-based elements fall completely flat...
31599|1|A witty, entertaining film.
80164|1|What Altman comes up with is sometimes almost a documentary feel; at the end of California Split we know something about organized gambling in this country we didn't know before.
83288|1|Amusingly and wistfully records how the artist and his crowd tried to make a success of it beyond the Mudd Club and other downtown haunts.
83006|0|The film grows more comic as it's supposed to be scary.
68883|1|What's so surprising about this film is just how loose and effortlessly enjoyable it is, despite all its ideas and images. It's one of the director's very best.
83213|1|A gorgeous period melodrama, packed with romantic tragedy and violent intrigue, it is both gritty and dreamy, political and personal.
41026|0|No one does this kind of thing better than Bullock, but one wonders for how long she can pull it off. Perhaps for as long as it pays.
84279|0|...there's just nothing terribly memorable about Blind Horizon.
95176|0|This movie is an ecclesiastical disaster and, like the Rector of Stiffkey, Williams should be thrown to the lions.
8353|1|A poignant family-in-crisis drama aided by spectacular performances from Streep and Neill.
28841|1|If you're in the mood to watch heads, arms and other appendages getting chopped off, this movie is for you.
77807|1|Though Hardcore's so-called gritty images do have the power to disturb, it's because we're intrinsically aware of their psychic scourge on the hero
68536|1|If only all biblical films could be this groovy.
33980|0|A ludicrously convoluted, laughably hard-boiled heist movie that inspires incredulity rather than affection.
86501|0|A colossal disappointment by any measure, this latest Indiana Jones film focuses in on the character weaknesses of its creators George Lucas and Steven Spielberg.
97465|0|The Kite Runner will no doubt warm the hearts of its intended audience, but its nature is one of dubious flattery.
96788|1|It bears a resemblance to viscerally exciting seventies urban thrillers like The French Connection, in which only the fascists could do what needed to be done.
52179|0|I sort of enjoyed it, but it's thoroughly bankrupt filmmaking.
69518|1|A fiercely powerful and melancholy tale about dreams, aspirations and belonging, House of Sand and Fog is a marvellous adaptation.
97493|1|[An] appealing and crowd-pleasing film.
12495|1|The camaraderie between the two principal actors is almost as appealing as it was in Butch Cassidy.
92698|1|What lifts this film above the average is the extremely clever, erudite and witty dialogue.
43299|1|If you're going to have a mall-ready entertainment about the war on terror, you might as well have this one. [Blu-ray]
99443|1|Rarely are crowd-pleasers so effortlessly artful.
18020|0|Hello, Deedles. Terrible to meet you.
91043|1|Of course, the adults don't matter much compared with the middle-school version of the Crips, and the young cast is enjoyable indeed.
54138|0|A Tootsie-role sports farce that's a drag in every which way.
93817|0|The squeaky clean love story of Jane Austen fails to make hay of either women's liberation or the miracle of creative writing, sticking to lush estates and courtly costume finery instead
5980|0|An exercise in overwrought style and overwritten melodrama, and proof that a great cast cannot save a film from self-destruction.
8077|1|Baldwin, in particular, has an appealing bad-boy quality.
82126|1|As desnecessárias participações especiais irritam um pouco, mas as fascinantes conversas entre Vera e seus admiradores salvam o filme.
75328|1|Its visual beauty is compelling and its emotions are kindled from within, as it takes off from the source of its literary roots and becomes a pure cinematic experience.
53480|1|Quiet, adult and just about more stately than any contemporary movie this year... a true study, a film with a questioning heart and mind that isn't afraid to admit it doesn't have all the answers.
61924|1|It's an entertaining pastiche, a slice of movie history that's both fun and educational (if slightly myopic about what has come since).
6240|1|A tres hip slice of life about the dilemma of marital commitment with just a pinch of Hitchcock providing the cutting edge.
15194|1|This is a simple story of hope and triumph, of one girl with the drive to succeed defying the odds and following her dream. It's not an original tale -- movies like this abound -- but Nava's point-of-view is fresh.
56337|0|Jaglom has never been required viewing, but he has never been this trivial, either.
36496|1|Gladiator, well cast and impressively staged, is every inch the summer blockbuster it intends to be. It's also something more. Amid the action and intrigue, director Scott makes a few points about blockbuster-style entertainment.
17317|0|The first half of Costner's The Postman is actually quite interesting, but it falters badly in the second half with a few unintentional howlers.
31828|0|Instead of a compelling and tense movie, we get a disappointing exercise in Hollywood cliché.
23953|1|This is a movie about the devastation experienced in Japan during the war. It just happens to have a giant dino-monster in it.
32693|0|An odd bit of spiritual dithering, not really bad but not really good.
56855|0|Here's another musical mishap that landed on Creative Loafing's list of The 10 Worst Rock Films Ever Made, taking the #3 slot just under Staying Alive and the champ, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
36168|1|Molina stares down all clichés, veering away from effeminate tones when they would be most convenient and avoids trapping Ken into a brooding madman.
39284|1|It's fast, short, restlessly plotted and, at times, pure bananas.
86492|1|Exhilarating
14103|0|Easily the weakest of the original cast Star Trek films.
23130|0|Shows such affinity for the stage that it barely qualifies as a movie.
39366|1|Nearly every time an intimate moment presents itself, someone cracks a sitcom-worthy punchline, or a pop song comes up on the soundtrack and distracts us from the task of getting to know just who these people are.
9803|1|A quirky, multi-character collage that skillfully keeps you off balance, not knowing where it's headed.
88164|1|Genre fans will get a kick from the martial-arts action, and that's all District B13 needs to do.
75578|0|Though the film is your basic revenge tale, it moves at such a snail's pace that the visceral excitement of the genre is nowhere to be found.
69884|1|The overfamiliarity of What Doesn't Kill You is redeemed by a full-scale performance from Mark Ruffalo.
23821|1|The cast is good, but it's nothing they haven't done a million times; the same goes for the animation, music, and general production design.
93129|0|Disappointing film that can't decide whether it's meant to be a romantic comedy or an emotional drama and fails at both as a result.
23424|1|Shows how humor is a rich spiritual resource that enables us to cope with the unexpected and to smile through the unbearable.
3321|1|It is an impressive first feature for its director, Lee Tamahori, and a splendid dramatic vehicle for its stars, especially Rena Owen.
9022|1|a visual marvel of expressionistic deep-focus cinematography, elaborate production design, and varied editing rhythms
60714|0|Une bien mauvaise caricature.
3150|1|A masterpiece of vintage horror. Entertaining, creepy and stylish.
52010|1|What remains is inevitably, irritatingly uneven, but still tender and insightful. It will cut you up.
85650|1|Marks [Asia Argento] as a far more adventurous and even risk-addicted filmmaker than her famous father Dario.
11148|1|Taylor's charming comedy owes its existence to Fellini's I Vitelloni and Barry Levinson's Diner.
19712|0|Freddy Krueger's 3-D death is about as lame as the rest of this crummy flick, the sixth and supposedly last in the often imaginative but ultimately numbing Nightmare on Elm Street series.
75635|1|True to its weepy telefilm resemblance, Dear Frankie delivers several eye-dabbing moments, but the tears...are earned through solid storytelling and subdued acting.
57063|0|...one would be far better off watching a YouTube highlight reel rather than the movie itself.
63307|1|Often overwrought and at times positively irritating, the film turns into an engrossing thriller almost in spite of itself.
75068|1|Most of the characters may be trapped in programmed spontaneity, but you can get a real lift out of the landscapes, the crisp sunlight splayed over gas stations and billboards, and the cannonade of '50s and '60s rock oldies.
3296|0|One of those movies that evaporates from memory the moment you leave the theater.
38611|1|A powerful film with simple, heartfelt performances by all.
13478|1|If you like to think of every time at bat as a new hope, if you can taste a kind of poetry along with the hot dogs they serve at the ballpark, if you like to imagine that life is meant to be good, and miracles aren't out of the question... go see [it].
61254|1|It's a breathtaking work, and a key citation in the case for confession as suitable material for art.
38360|1|There's such a sunny air about this subterranean party story that it's difficult not to like.
68648|1|A insightful essay on sexual politics: Rowlands is terrific as a housewife who crosses the line into sanity. With a light feminist touch, she is perceived as a victim of repressive patriarchal order.
12013|1|12 Angry Men has some shrewd observations to sell about argumentation and group behavior, but they're not the ones of which the film seems most proud.
91715|0|Only Sandra Bullock shines as Harper Lee.
38014|0|Truly appalling, repetitive, utterly predictable film.
66457|0|It tries to be satirical and valiant, but doesn't quite get there.
79895|0|Penn's strong sympathy with the outsider and anti-Establishment stance comes across in a film that appealed to those who could identify with this communal hippie haven, but now seems too naive and distant.
89852|0|Turns out to be a movie with little to remember despite the precise craft and efforts of its creators. It's as if they worked hard for nothing.
3972|1|Great fun all around.
14836|0|I'm not even going to get into the dialogue, the plot, the other performances, because as the sage advice goes, if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all.
51332|1|Washington, Woods, and Duvall are so capable, they almost save this schlock-fest from itself.
66786|1|Engaging
87493|1|Silverman's full-on approach works because she unflinchingly examines these themes with a disarming sweetness.
34655|1|Great family adventure with favorite characters.
15709|0|A poor imitation of a screwball comedy.
65773|0|The film sags from the weight of too many characters, and its suggestion that the world is nothing but sadness is too much to bear.
41137|1|a slightly more accurate mythology of the Cuban Missile Crisis
70145|1|one of the saddest movies ever produced
62329|1|Painless, sweet comedy.
51318|0|The movie's surplus of male-fraternizing never conveys that these Americans are under imminent danger and stress.
53558|0|An OK musical, derivative of Annie Get Your Gun, which is 100 times better.
23405|1|...finally can't help but come off as something of a minor disappointment...
85125|1|...Jim Carrey's most entertaining comedy since 1997's Liar Liar...
24002|1|All of this is cause for consistent smiling and a few outright laughs, without ever building to complete comedy.
93444|0|A sorry excuse for filmmaking.
85363|1|"There's little room for tears in the testosterone-riddled territory of quadriplegic rugby. ""Murderball"" spat on that power of the human spirit stuff and rolled along to a kick-ass showcase of not what spinal injury excluded, but what it enabled."
99239|1|Klimt is a feast for the eyes and the mind.
60656|1|It's a warm fun movie with a good sense of humor.
11757|1|Hear My Song is a nostalgic, heart-on-its-sleeve bit of movie-making; it's a charmer, but Chelsom's eccentric sense of comedy guarantees that the sentiment never becomes suffocating; it's precious without being cloying.
78233|0|You'll be lucky if you survive this dumb movie.
26075|1|As brightly written by Castellaneta and enacted by possibly the best ensemble cast ever assembled in gay film, it's a real gem.

81350|1|An interesting look into the minds of the warriors against the machines, and what can tempt them.
45085|0|The sets and camerawork are astounding, and film and literature buffs will have fun spotting the references. But the circus-related material is thin, the philosophic pontificating is atypically glib, and the all-star cast is given precious little to do.
40816|0|Chocolat is awful.

54410|1|finely crafted, finely written, exquisitely performed
76937|1|Yes, it's an old story that has been told a thousand times before and since, but Alexandre Rockwell's little film has a home movie charm and a streetwise wit that make it a must-see sleeper.
29375|0|Too simplistic and silly.
25442|1|She's All That showcases a pair of bright young stars whose charms partially camouflage a predictable plot.
67667|1|The least, perhaps, of the Spencer Tracy-Katharine Hepburn collaborations...this 1957 comedy is nevertheless a bright and witty vehicle for its stars, directed well and anonymously by that fine old hack Walter Lang.
13101|1|Mutual irritation merges into grudging friendship, and the wit manages to be both broad and smart, soulful and silly, subtle and raucous, all at the same time.

96295|0|The film improves, but the heavy handed first half drags its mood to the end, where predictability and corn mix into a concoction as unappetising as the health smoothie Joe Kingman creates for breakfast with his disgusted little daughter
14991|1|It's pensive male anxiety, and for some cultural reason it's easier for audiences to accept female hysteria than the insecurities of men.

5620|1|Unsanitised, worryingly convincing in its sadomasochistic detail, this is seriously provocative cinema, a telling reminder of what it really means to be dangerous.
64079|1|Sprinkling in bad jokes and Rat Pack references, Dean Martin's comic timing and delivery is impeccable -- as he parodies and deconstructs his image as a notorious lover and drunk.

20867|1|I just love hand drawn animation, it really brings to life all the characters in a very expressive way. The imperfections doing it by hand give everything a rougher edge but more heart.
19792|1|Watching it again today, it works oddly well, almost like a John Hughes movie that got lost and wandered into slasher territory.
3166|0|Overall the film is as static as its star's face which -- given the large amount of scantily-clad female flesh on display -- is really quite an achievement.

72559|1|Even if its influence on contemporary filmmakers weren't so striking and acknowledged, Le Samourai would stand well enough on its own merits, strongly suggesting that some of the greatest films of the future may well come from the past.
4807|0|Landis relies on routine action -- and cameos by such noted filmmakers as George Lucas, John Singleton, Martha Coolidge and others -- to hide the fact that there's no engine under his movie's hood.
73767|1|Predictable in its moves, it's engaging enough, though it has nowhere near the characterisation, say, of Paul Giamatti and Thomas Hayden Church in Sideways.

93984|1|An odd, beguiling little movie -- about two parts Dickens (with some Dickensian Chaplin thrown in) to one part Italian neorealist cinema.
12258|0|A monument to waste, noise and misplaced cool, but it does have its engagingly nutty moments.
95065|1|Is it a travesty? A farce? Utterly preposterous? Exactly.
64356|1|The consequence is a crescendo of excitement and involvement with the fervor and passion of Jesus and an accumulating sense of the irony and tragedy of Jesus' suffering, in historical as well as spiritual terms.

11794|1|This wonderful film, perfect in setting the scene of the era and locale, could not be a better story of hope and inspiration.
82514|1|Always more than a mere by-numbers domestic drama, The Upside of Anger is desperately, darkly funny, with dialogue to, er, die for, and a perfect cast.
82235|0|Starts off making almost no sense and becomes less and less logical the longer it plays.
61170|0|It's slow, but it's also sure-footed. Duvall takes it at his own damn pace, and his grouchy old man of a contract killer is a well-rounded and wholly believable personage.

21358|0|Aside from a sensational, continuous 20-minute opening take, and an amazing shot that literally swoops over the top of a row of hotel rooms, there's little of interest here.

59940|1|Bruce Campbell (Evil Dead II, etc.) jumps on the post-modern bandwagon with this refreshingly low-key and absolutely hilarious horror comedy.
80783|0|As a courtesy to his many fans, the ponytailed action hero Steven Seagal not only attacks sleaze but also goes out of his way to examine it.
75788|0|Ultimately feels like tiny films glued together by events that often test plausibility.
40659|1|There's plenty of big laughs in this odd-couple comedy, but the main characters are also given a number of human moments, which leads to an ending that's downright poignant.
83307|1|James comes crashing nervously into the movie like a fat guy who went through the wrong door and ended up on the fashion show catwalk. He's perfect.
8364|0|I don't see how any gifted actor could have done less than Brando does here. His resident power, his sheer innate force, has rarely seemed weaker.

94815|0|As likeable as the movie was, I just didn't find it as funny as I thought I would.
90092|0|Sofia Coppola has sacrificed a compelling storyline in exchange for aimless atmospherics.
70549|1|Probably the best film of the blaxploitation experience.
21460|1|A mildly dirty reworking of love, popularity and wild times, this is John Hughes' scrappiest film to date, but it redeems its tastelessness and stupidity by being fairly funny most of the time.
58833|1|It's a gripping version of Ira Levin's best novel.
36994|1|It's a good, engaging movie - great-looking, too, with top-notch photography and production design - but it tends to fall apart when you start kicking the tires and peek under the hood.

74111|1|Irvin, who shot a documentary in Vietnam in 1969, the year the action takes place, makes fine use of the Philippines locations and the verisimilitude supplied by the production team.

26983|1|...the film has aged incredibly poorly in the years since its 1978 debut.
99062|0|If [director] Schaefer's intent was to provide some sort of insight into Chapman's character, some hint of explanation for this senseless tragedy, he fails, probably because there's none to be found beyond one lonely guy's addled brain chemistry.
91934|0|The film is confirmation of Paul Haggis's predilection for exploitation and easy sentimentality.
97706|1|It's the closest a film has ever gotten to a roller-coaster ride. It will definitely nauseate, it feels claustrophobic, there are sudden scares, and it also peaks too early.
96940|0|The film's sense of humor is juvenile...
7307|1|Face/Off is the best action movie of the summer.

2045|0|A diffuse, uninvolving star vehicle aimed at saving Stallone's box-office viability manages to display most of his weaknesses.
43255|1|Boasts a self-referential irreverence that gleefully attacks pop culture by using members of pop culture
39700|1|This special effects extravaganza from 1966 has proved surprisingly enduring, despite a technical quality crude by contemporary standards; perhaps it's the screwball poetry of the plot.
63494|1|A more satisfactory adaptation of the spirit of Stan Lee's Marvel character.
82103|1|The film fairly skips along as it introduces us to this strange world.
97109|1|The depressing subtext is that even with detailed proof of ongoing genocide, it takes movie stars to get to the movers and shakers, and to get worthy movies like this one into theaters.
45627|0|Hideous.
27395|1|A great treatment of the original novel, and one I revisit constantly.
16457|1|Smith's most mature film. Yes, it's filled with crude dialogue, blunt descriptions of sex and an overkill of Star Wars references, but it uses these to dig deeper and make its subject matter more accessible.
82547|1|Mr. Hare has assembled a superb cast, and its ensemble work is very fine.
41519|0|Not many funny skits in this anthology.
78031|0|Despite an excellent supporting cast something in p.s. goes mushy and implausible.
86981|1|"Intended as director Gore Verbinski's palate cleanser before back-to-back ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" sequels, this is an apprehensive cringe comedy of male malaise. It's also Verbinski's best to date, a small-scale challenge he should attempt more often."
75366|0|By the time all the bets are in, Cincinnati Kid appears to hold a losing hand.
7308|1|Cage is good, Travolta is better. There is a glee to his performance, a sheer joy at playing two roles in one. He's having a rip-roaringly good time, and so are we.
2391|1|This movie has all the elements that Miramax's other fashion film, Robert Altman's disastrously received Ready to Wear, didn't, including intrigue, humor, irony, pathos and real live supermodels.

51343|0|John Q's agitprop requires audiences who think art is worthy if it affirms their moral beliefs.

57564|1|...suspenseful and sensuous, exasperatingly preposterous, and almost every minute entertaining.
38692|0|Melodrama is bad enough, contrived melodrama is worse, and badly written contrived melodrama is Autumn in New York.
42450|1|Ignored both at the cinema and on tape, this is a gem that is as happy sending up the music video world as it is poking fun at politics.
28031|1|It's streetwise stuff, shot in a vigorous on-the-hoof style, but also full of joy, both in its blissfully comic moments and in Doinel's telling passion for moviegoing.
54800|1|Groovy, baby.
55059|1|An unorthodox little film noir organized crime story that includes one of the strangest love stories you will ever see.
36947|1|The Gold Rush is a distinct triumph for Charlie Chaplin from both the artistic and commercial standpoints, and is a picture certain to create a veritable riot at theatre box offices.

43092|0|The broad slapstick that could remotely be considered mildly funny in their native context goes over like a lead balloon en anglais.
92412|0|For a film about the birth of Jesus, there's nothing particularly joyous or inspiring - just dull, disinteresting details that too strongly disconnect from the human frailty and folly that is hinted at in the story.
45556|0|A doughy, unimaginative spin-off beyond any saving by its two resourceful stars.

28884|1|Smart, funny -- and edgy.
98173|1|Enjoyable, well made children's fantasy adventure with likeable characters, impressive special effects and a decent script.
29223|1|Mr. Giamatti and Ms. Davis seem to feed off each other, bringing out the best performances we've seen from these actors.
1757|1|The use of dreams fused with reality works because the two things balance one another to create a whole, instead of detracting as a cop-out as most movies with this motif rely on.

60138|1|We are unmistakably in the presence of a love story, enriched and imbued with local color [yet] I could feel myself straining to love a film that in actuality I merely liked.
11772|1|The film is a smashing success on its own terms, though as a transcendent love story it lacks the firm foundation in human reality that characterizes Lars Von Trier's superior Breaking the Waves.
81938|1|Think of a politicized version of the MTV show Punk'd and you're on your way to getting the idea of The Yes Men.
33915|0|It's like one of those late Blake Edwards comedies in which very little is working, but you have to admire the attempt at some physical humor.
42159|1|A must-see if only for its last scene, one of the most evocatively filmed finales ever to impart fate upon two lovers.

61698|1|A marvelously courageous personal statement that becomes more fascinating with time.
10341|1|Whereas Dances With Wolves was an epic cultural tract, That Thing You Do! is a piece of entertaining bubblegum which, like its director, making his feature directorial debut, is high on charm and style.
84676|1|Uma história de amor absolutamente atípica que, depois de provocar uma estranheza inicial, acaba levando o espectador a mergulhar em sua lógica particular.
59065|1|The tone it establishes is challenging, because there are funny scenes and situations which could easily be played for laughs, but that black cloud of tension and danger hangs over all of them, and Scorsese won't give you that release.
61916|0|Fitfully interesting in its own right, but more useful as a device to point you toward checking out the original source material.
77552|0|It's obvious even from the character names that Mr. Conran has a good grasp on his source material. The problem is, he doesn't do anything with it.
63413|1|Inventive slapstick comedy and a fun movie.
57774|1|A wonderful salute to British decency and a touching portrait of a friendship that bridges national boundaries.
102041|0|You want to cringe as the picture begins, but you end up quite enjoying it.
21614|0|It's way too hackneyed for John Hughes. He's already shown us that he knows better.

20399|1|The third and final Godfather saga; not for kids.
42554|1|One of the greatest (and sadly most forgotten) romantic comedies ever, which has not a cracking script, but some trademark-terrific visuals.
86358|1|A quirky, artistic triumph.
1182|1|This is a movie about friendship, about foolhardy endeavors that get your adrenaline going and make you feel life buzzing in your toes. Written with wit and concision and remarkable confidence, Bottle Rocket is a joyride worth taking.
60715|1|Madly arranged in one ambivalent, entirely creative work that attempts not only to convey a feeling, but a sense of experience
86190|1|Takes Reiser's good screenplay, adds a veteran actor who nails his performance, and comes up with a perfectly charming comedy.

52346|0|Passable teen/sports movie.
79167|1|Great, deep, humane, well-built comedy. But throw in Barbara Stanwyck's unbelievable act of character creation, and that's when Ball of Fire becomes its best self.
76907|1|Still a hell of a ride, but could've used a smoother landing.
53261|1|Melville at his best
15785|0|The conceit is sweet but the execution is meandering.
15428|0|Both the protagonists and the film are doomed from the start, in this vulgar and mindless action flick.
88337|1|If the subject matter is bleak and bitterly serious, the tone throughout is darkly comic, while the precise imagery effortlessly conveys the tension, the claustrophobia, and the madness of the situation.
5642|1|Branagh's highly entertaining and accessible take on one of the Bard's zestiest comedies. [Blu-ray]
5023|0|The beginning of the end for Chevy Chase.
71268|1|A very well characterized thriller...
2661|1|Polanski wisely never opens out the action from the remote clifftop house. In keeping things claustrophobic, close-up and ambivalent, he heightens the suspense (not to mention the sexual tension).
64237|1|Rudolph's past work has been spotty, but his stress here on familial sovereignty is moving, as is his direction of the three children.
42413|1|Brendan and Trudy and company deliver a grand good time.
37224|1|Its genius, then and now, was the manner in which director Mel Brooks and his writers turned a broad Western spoof into what was, for its time, a revolutionary satire of race relations.
35969|1|Graced with fine performances and commendably biting off more than it can ever hope to chew, The Prince Of Tides is a rare slice of romantic moviemaking for all those grown-ups feeling ignored since Kramer Vs. Kramer last rattled their value systems.
7873|1|With maybe 25 belly laughs, the brazenly crude Kingpin is often uproarious, but be forewarned that its creators apparently conceived it underneath a limbo bar. How looow can a funny guilty pleasure go?
100676|0|"Director Paul Weiland (""Made of Honor"") co-wrote the tone-deaf screenplay for this cinematic abortion that features the ever-lousy Stephen Rea adding his specific brand of stench to a pasted-together movie that is predictable and boring as it is depressin"
29864|1|I will confess that Travolta totally turned me around. A mountain of a woman in his female fat suit, he commits 150% to the role.
934|0|The design and effects teams have lent scale and impact to the futuristic locations and sets. If only Duguay's flashy, aimless direction had succeeded in filling these barren wastes and antiseptic interiors with something resembling human life.

66157|1|"A great deal of the fun of watching this very assured film is seeing with what energetic panache the actor takes on the mantle of the mobster J. Edgar Hoover once called ""the most dangerous man in America."""
69216|1|The backstage finish, with Harpo doing a Tarzan on the fly ropes, contains more action than the Marxes usually go in for, but it relieves the strictly verbal comedy and provides a sock exit.
47429|0|Call it a pleasant near-miss.
87553|1|With its laughable dramatic sequences and goofy supporting characters, this film is hard to dismiss as entertainment: a camp treat for comics as well as Usher fans.
85016|1|Torrid eroticism tinged by a sense of menace . . . circles around its complex, conflicted characters before plunging into their dark feelings and hidden half-truths.
75150|0|Miss March must be a contender for worst film of the year. It's so poor that you begin to suspect it's a pastiche.
25151|0|Além não gerar tensão alguma no espectador, ainda torna-se enfadonho a partir de sua metade.
50699|0|A lazy attempt to spoof the popular sci-fi movies of the day.
101485|0|The film is hinged on unapologetic formula, looking to enchant the viewer through the act of repetition, but the writing isn't smart enough to wipe the dust off the plot.
39974|0|Another Saturday Night Live sketch character tries, futilely, to stretch to feature-length proportion...
32820|1|McQueen works hard and al most manages to triumph over his star presence, while Hoffman submerges himself eccentrically and amusingly in his coward's role.
102071|0|Stylish cinematography along with decent performances don't compensate for an often tedious plot that lacks any real tension, imagination or palpable poignancy.
15890|1|The whole movie is pretty good at stopping and lampooning itself every time things are getting just too silly.

59190|1|This Danish import provides a showcase for the lead actors, especially wide-eyed Stengade, who manages sensuality amid all the emotional volatility.
88651|1|London is a very simple character piece that is not for every taste. I recommend the film, but I fully expect some that see it based on my recommendation will curse my name come the end credits.
98808|1|As period rom-coms go, Leatherheads is mild entertainment.
88936|0|The movie -- a metaphor for the tangled, impossible state of Israeli/Palestinian relations -- only intermittently clicks.
58634|1|"The setting is so cool that it chills the characters, reducing our emotional stake in the outcome of ""Intacto's"" dangerous and seductively stylish game."
93338|1|Considering just how many cooks there were in the kitchen, Paris, je t'aime came out with a pretty even feeling

81339|0|All candied gloss and smart quips.
15752|0|I wonder if it's unforgivable heresy to say The Cell is badly underestimated and due for revisionism while The Fall, despite its relative obscurity, is badly overestimated.
75476|1|An oddly affecting and haunting film, thanks to the deliberate pacing and an appropriately enigmatic starring turn by actor Koji Yakusho.
11800|1|A stirring and triumphant biodrama about Christy Brown, who overcame being severely handicapped by cerebral palsy.
61470|1|At times Lin's story slides into crime cliches, but whatever he lacks in plotting he makes up for in style and brute emotional force.
24397|0|The body count is rising, Sly's pecs are blowing up, and Rambo himself is becoming more of a brand-name than a character, a mascot for masochism and murderous self-assertion.

76701|1|Maggie Smith deservedly won the 1969 Best Actress Oscar for playing a charismatic, authoritarian teacher in a Scottish girls school in the early 1930s.
4477|1|Meg Ryan gives a solid peformance in this flawed melodrama about alcoholics
9105|1|It is the finest job of direction accomplished by a master director and may justly be called Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece.
84087|1|One of the most undervalued of musicals.
93697|0|It is not its lack of resolution that makes Zodiac a poor film, it is its stupefying dull progression.
62475|1|Much of this information could have been delivered in a way that respected the Friedmans, even if they did not respect each other.
42976|1|Too Much Sleep is loaded with the same quirkiness one expects from an independent comedy, although it's not as self-consciously strange as most.
57525|0|Despite impeccable acting ... and a script that takes some rather unexpected (even, at times, preposterous) turns, Love is just too, too precious in the end.
53472|0|Diane Lane is the best part of an otherwise unimpressive movie.
41726|0|The pseudomystical vagueness that seems to be Spielberg's stock-in-trade stifles most of the particularity of the source.
1397|1|Givens, Lawrence and Berry all put in enjoyable performances, and while Murphy can no longer match those memorable early roles, he's on good form here.
62645|1|An enigmatic, poetic, disturbing, interestingly pretentious fable.
930|0|A moronic buddy comedy with a fuzzy-wuzzy coating.
44259|0|Neither the disaster its title indicates nor the cheap laugh-fest that the presence of Martin Lawrence would imply.
12834|1|The movie has never really been about gold but about character, and Bogart fearlessly makes Fred C. Dobbs into a pathetic, frightened, selfish man -- so sick we would be tempted to pity him, if he were not so undeserving of pity.
96613|1|An exuberant autobiographical film and dark-horse contender for an animated feature Oscar.
71694|1|Good fun for those who like Mametian con-inside-a-con-inside-a-con trickery.
6874|0|"To its credit, ""Jack and Sarah"" eschews the standard cutesy-poo shenanigans found in movies where adorable infants run inexperienced adults ragged with their needs. Unfortunately, the movie has very little comedy to offer in place of such antics."
28490|0|So-so Price horror offering
77245|1|McGuigan imbues Wicker Park with a disorienting atmosphere and visual style, using available window panes and deep focus techniques like a split-screen effect to show simultaneous actions and emotions upon which the narrative twists and turns.
55347|1|The French have no equal when it comes to perfectly aligned bottom-kicking, showing revulsion at the ill-breeding of others, or performing semi-socialist slapstick.
54201|1|Sayles' writing is so good, and so convincing, he makes the experience more like reading a complex and well-researched novel than watching a movie.

53910|1|...Liman is also clever enough to make the real action start when the motor stops.
67323|0|With its emphasis on global positioning devices, Jet Skis and computer-designed surfboards, Mr. Boston's film is very much concerned with the stuff and very little with the spirit of professional surfing as practiced today.
87907|1|This punishing, borderline amoral picture is Spielberg at his most bleak, and most challenging. It refuses to pick sides and resonates in unsettling ways.
33840|1|With a delightfully unexpected ending and keen characterizations throughout, Raining Stones is an entertaining look at working class life on the edge of desperation.

98567|1|The laughs are gentle but regular and all roles are played brilliantly, especially McDormand and the gorgeous Amy Adams as Delysia. Miss Pettigrew is 90 minutes of charming escapism - a perfect movie for mums.

15917|1|Stallone more than holds his own against an all-star ensemble cast; indeed, he soundly anchors the picture.
49750|1|Patrick Wayne is a dull lead (he has none of the big-screen presence of his dad The Duke), and the effects are even less polished than those in the previous film -- still, there's enough of interest to make it an entertaining and undemanding time-filler.

40540|1|Whereas The Sixth Sense left audiences surprised but surprisingly comfortable, this more mature and ambitious movie preserves its ambiguities and keeps everyone guessing.
57987|1|A victory of style over substance.
47780|0|Who was this movie made for? Not for me, that's sure, but I have a hunch younger kids will find it satisfying.
1173|1|Its chief pleasure is the acting of the big cast, notably Pacino. At 55, he has a haggard, life-wrestling beauty and a street eloquence that has more innocence than De Niro and more sincerity than Nicholson.

28125|1|The snappy dialogue comes thick and fast, while Spacek and Harper revel in turns that landed them both Oscar nominations.
4959|1|it has truly awe-inspiring stunts and special effects and many of its suspense sequences will leave you with your heart in your mouth.
89431|1|There is a certain slapdash energy and heedless silliness to the proceedings that is somewhat engaging, certainly more so than the hateful likes of Date Movie.
41636|0|The film thinks it wants to be sincere, when all it truly wants is to be popular, just like the other kids' movies, so it sells off its originality.
35|1|Irresistible...the prime hams and real-life friends share comic timing that can only come from years of experience. [Blu-ray]
6642|1|It's a towering achievement that grows more riveting and resonant with the years.
86247|0|There's no rule that videogame movies have to be idiotic. And there's no rule that action-horror flicks need be dumb.
82558|1|Welles had intended to narrate the section himself, but the writers and directors of this documentary have wisely opted not to second-guess Welles, simply presenting the material as it stands and adding music and sound effects.
81648|1|The production itself is so rich in authentic emotional life and breathtaking visuals, word of mouth and positive reviews should carry the (pay) day.
46366|1|"A polemic against South African apartheid, this may not meet criteria for ""great"" filmmaking, but director Euzhan Palcy's film succeeds in being significant."
92211|1|"""Happy Feet"" clinches the current trend of animated message films that speak for the plight of animals and the ecology."
84899|0|A stroll down sitcom memory lane in name only, The Honeymooners seems as if any resemblance to the original TV classic could only be accidental.
31631|1|A meaningful Christmas Carol this is not, but a perfectly entertaining yuletide comedy this certainly is.
94645|1|A beautifully acted, poignant film about a man who slowly loses his wife to Alzheimer's.
100308|0|All in all, it's a bit of a snore that falls back on romance when all else fails.
60438|0|In the spectrum of modern martial arts movies, Cradle 2 the Grave is glorified B-movie fodder at best.
32351|1|A deliberate retelling of 'The King and I' without the musical interludes. 'Anna and the King' is a slow, but ultimately rewarding period drama.
97248|0|No, I didn't read the novel before seeing the film, and nothing in this shimmering disaster made me want to read it, either. Made me hate polar bears, and I used to love the darned things, so that's saying something.
1063|1|This impeccably filmed comedy horror film echoes An American Werewolf in London and early Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson, but it has its own unique energy, and it's a must-see.
17291|0|Judd, Samuel L. Jackson, Andy Garcia and David Strathairn all are wasted.
23745|0|The movie is all over the map, trying whatever seems to work at the moment.
43149|1|...takes some inappropriate religious liberties, but still manages to be downright creepy and suspenseful.
58620|0|I got a headache watching this meaningless downer.
7706|1|Never as compelling as its central performance, it's still a very good film - and after all, that's a hard performance to live up to.
19061|1|it lives beyond its 65 years to be a film that is watchable and exciting today
9240|1|A fun musical with creative choreography, but far too little substance.
95721|0|The action is ho-hum, the attempts at comedy are inept and the whole mismatched partners mojo is all dried up in this snooze-worthy third, and hopefully last, Rush Hour flick.
77743|0|way too predictible
68735|1|One of Griffith's most rousing visions of film as visual-emotional ebb and flow, connection and rupture
24549|1|For the most part, the Rocky pictures have been outstanding entertainments, beautifully crafted and executed, and Rocky V is an important and worthwhile addition to the series.
96779|0|A depressing film that celebrates brute strength as the only means to stem the tide of violence and crime in Rio de Janeiro.
15283|0|Anaconda is about a snake that eats everybody. That about says it all.
49107|0|"Even the most perplexing problems are wrapped up neatly before the conclusion. In this ""House,"" nobody goes home lonely: Even the local pimp gets some good, good lovin' before the final curtain."
832|0|All told, it's precisely what you'd expect -- which means you'd be well-advised to wait for the video.
59693|1|Though coarser and cheaper than Almodovar's later efforts, this comic orgy is prototypically Pedrovian.
2543|0|Is Ross trying to mimic Michael Haneke, daring his audience to be disgusted by the very titillating premise which probably brought them to the movie in the first place?
30988|1|A powerful, gripping, darkly humorous film with a dynamite lead performance by Michael Douglas. One of 1993's ten-best films.
25469|1|A risk-all masterpiece from one of our greatest film-makers.
70141|1|One of the top movie westerns.
31147|1|...an important cautionary tale for all of us not take everything we see and hear at face value.
61531|0|There is some good acting on view as we watch Agnes' brave attempts to face up to a past that includes incest and pregnancy, but Daniel McIvor's adaptation of his stage play is hardly going to quicken anyone's pulse.
30794|1|A thriller that also manages to focus on the art of mentoring.
70921|0|Though Lohan and Fox are fun to look at, and Allison Pill is adorable, the film is pure mindless, ridiculous fluff.
69404|1|I enjoyed Big Fish more than any film Burton has been involved with since maybe Nightmare Before Christmas.
28632|0|At times this poor version of a sitcom seems written by five-year-olds for five-year-olds, so much so that one suspects its script was fingerpainted.
21665|1|...it's hard not to get a kick out of watching a character battle over a cup of water with a baboon.
89373|1|There are no grey shadings in the film's visual palette to match the characters' more equivocal moralities, and the result is a dark, dark world occasionally exposed to the most harsh and unforgiving of lights.
59320|1|You have to like a movie that was the true inspiration to that famous animated skunk Pépé le Pew.
588|0|Platoon lite with a bitter ending that doesn't work in its favor...
23527|1|More political than entertaining, The Siege is a reflection of our heightened awareness and sensitivity to terrorism and the price of freedom.
83019|1|The final shot, in particular, is awesome, and confirms that the sooner Cameron gets back to making proper movies, instead of Boys' Own diversions, the better.
92230|0|Let's not. And say we did.
36421|0|The script, based on a novel by Billie Lett, is sprinkled with phrases meant to be poignant and funny, but sound like repackaged cliches.
31807|1|An extremely well-directed and acted (particularly by Glenn Close as the career woman) thriller that also functions as cautionary tale about sex in the swinging 1970s and parable of AIDS in the 1980s.
84444|1|At least it's not aggressively stupid...A Lot Like Love is an agreeably mediocre movie that can be watched, enjoyed and forgotten about in the space of a single day.
15903|0|A good effort, but the star power on show throws the proceedings off kilter somewhat, hiking up an expectation that the film ultimately cannot live up to.
44449|1|One of the most charming, entertaining and colourful musicals of the 1950s.
16113|0|A dark, dank and derivative horror ride only an Orkin man could truly love.
29566|1|Certainly nothing brilliant, but King fans may find something to enjoy.
89914|0|I can't believe that even the most rabid chick-flick masochists wouldn't gag on it.
79291|0|A turgid affair with John Garfield having to choose either socialite Joan Crawford or his bow strings.
46732|1|If more people appreciated stories like this, movies and comic books would be better off.
64991|1|A textbook example of how to make a documentary.
23206|1|It's not one long series of gunfights and carefully choreographed car chases: it's a throwback to character-driven 1970s-era crime thrillers.
83391|0|Wait till it comes out on video. You'll know when to turn what off.
45245|1|... one of the most lacerating and vicious visions of the predatory urban world in the American cinema...
18312|0|A clone of the first film except with a small twist...
53986|1|If you can stomach the rough content, it's worth checking out for the performances alone.
9312|1|A rousing, high-spirited family entertainment rightly regarded as one for the ages. [Blu-ray]
89582|1|It's a film for our time.
24509|1|The real question with Rocky III was how Sylvester Stallone could twist the plot to make an interesting difference. He manages.
87969|0|There's a discernible lack of enthusiasm from almost everyone involved, and Duff, who's gone from wholesome to haggard in two short years, is flat-out scary.
91834|0|In a season in which Invincible and Gridiron Gang already have laid claim to the title of inspirational football movie, this looks like an also-ran.
13344|1|A masterpiece of epic filmmaking, a profound religious experience and one of the greatest films ever made.
99776|1|With a little more ingenuity, a few more evilly funny lines and a more interestingly written role for its female lead, this could have been a minor cult classic.
4919|1|Mirren again shows us why she is still able to obtain leading vehicles at age 58.
44076|1|Thankfully, Crystal is more than willing to hog the screen with his whining, impressions, and glorious chemistry with Palance, whose entire performance is based around inconsistent levels of exhaling.
40718|0|Stone's attack on the excesses of the Me Decade could easily be dubbed Mr. Smith Goes to Wall Street.
71394|0|Though a contemporary audience would hardly find Peyton Place shocking today, what is intriguing is that audiences in 1957 would not have found it shocking either.
43186|1|Slight but affecting.
100880|1|The movie's aesthetic and narrative confusion are as much products of a muddled, if just barely successful, approach as it is of Folman's search among the ruins of his memory.
69520|0|Perelman and his long-suffering stars make a spectacle of pain, but fail to register any lighter notes, while the denouement seems calculated to wring out every last tear.
84533|1|One of Louis Malle's strangest, most eccentric films, this satire of political revolutions is visually spectacular, pairing France's two most popular stars: Brigitte Bardot and Jeanne Moreau.
25159|1|TCM 2 works because it's a complete original. You never know from minute to minute where it's going to go, and that unpredictability keeps you riveted for every single second.
47660|1|In alternating between farcical spoof and bittersweet romantic comedy, Maybe Baby maintains a surprisingly secure comic footing.
101934|1|Impressive performances, fascinating info-bytes and pertinent editorial, but in the end, it feels too much like an illustrated lecture.
59957|0|Ugh. Takes cinematic desperation to a whole new level.
62606|0|Early Coppola horror tale that suffers from overt silliness.
9381|1|Lost Horizon (1937) is a timeless, widely-acclaimed classic romantic fantasy film that was directed by Frank Capra.
19050|1|Very much a part of our cinema heritage, Cavalcade deserves to be remembered more than it has been.
48396|1|Best appreciated for its apocalyptic special effects.
28733|1|As a routinely cruel, often vicious, miserably unhappy teacher, Mirren offers a complex, brilliantly disciplined performance!
32035|1|The acting is excellent all around.
18431|1|a little too melodramatic
96721|1|It isn't enough for director and writer Fatih Akin to show that we're all only a few degrees from each other across countries; rather, he's also interested in the level of connectedness.
89733|0|Who knows whether Dan Brown was motivated by a distaste for Catholicism or merely by money? Regardless, it seems dishonest for him to foist his debunked heresies on the gullible, unsuspecting public as if they're the God's honest truth.
69369|1|A harrowing tale of honor, simple beauty, self-discovery, and ferocious conviction.
52770|1|One of the best horror mysteries ever conceived and yet one constantly over looked.
43000|0|It's about the most predictable -- and least original -- film you'll see for weeks.
26833|1|Like all stories, it belongs to the teller, not the subject.
7182|1|It's often hilarious. It's just that that humor is so mordant that it's sometimes hard to accept.
187|0|The only real sparks are set off by MacNicol as Renfield, the solicitor who develops a taste for flies and spiders after being bitten by Dracula.
44008|1|Himalaya is a film about choices, pride and forgiveness, filled with memorable characters and stunning scenery. And if you like yaks, this is the film for you.
88694|1|Not much of this is new territory, but it can be gripping at times.
79979|1|We're used to Eastwood playing a hero, so we accept his casual words and silky delivery without really questioning it
5109|0|...not as edgy as a spoof of hard-nosed crime dramas ought to be.
84053|1|Still tense today, more than 60 years after it was made
4277|1|Despite everything, it's still a marvellously energetic movie.
29105|1|A zesty, satisfying celebration of animation, fantasy, love, and the Beatles that pleases the eyes as much as the ears.
44615|1|While few of the paper-thin characters register long enough to make much of an impression, Diesel carries the movie with his unsettling mix of Zen-like tranquillity and barely controlled rage.
41694|0|Director Zack Snyder and writer James Gunn have simply traded one set of time-sensitive issues for more contemporary cliches.
97574|1|Awfully uneven, sometimes not funny at all, but John C. Reilly is so goofily sincere and Jake Kasdan and Judd Apatow include enough comedic gems to make it worthwhile.
60479|1|Fascinating, flawed Roeg film.
72432|0|More sexual innuendo than usual in provocatively named film.
55189|1|Davis ... gets vivid performances from her cast and pulls off some deft Ally McBeal-style fantasy sequences.
30429|1|Allen's neurotic outlook on life has never been presented with more clarity.
84735|0|Fad flick that has lots of skateboards ... and literally nothing else.
43805|0|Love Story ultimately drowns in syrup.
3283|0|An incoherent, experimental acid trip so unbearably pretentious that it gave me newfound respect for the Warren Commission. A real torture test.
61493|1|The Titanic has a haunting beauty that is served well by the movie's 3-dimensional process.
8986|1|Boasts epic visuals (the civil war, Atlanta on fire etc) as sweeping as Max Steiner's score.
50803|1|Elating visions
65435|1|Lack of ambition is not one of the movie's problems.
18995|1|An ambitious epic of tremendous sweep and scope.
84165|0|Rebecca Miller's third feature begins as a two-character drama, and it would have been so much better if it had stayed that way.
68994|1|Jean-Jacques Annaud made an impressive directing debut with his WWI-set political tale, which won the 1976 Best Foreign Language Oscar.
101796|1|Rob Brown did a nice job.
71317|1|Director/editor John W. Walter takes Johnson's own approach, piecing together individual reflections on the man to create a portrait of an artist
21801|1|Sparkles just like an old-fashioned musical--it's beautifully designed and skillfully directed.
80325|1|Controversial for its time, now so-so conspiracy theory plot about faked moon landing.
52008|1|Ambersons is not another Citizen Kane, but it is good enough to remove Director Welles for keeps from the novice or one-picture-prodigy class.
45636|1|An intense drama about substance abuse that turns out all too predictable, but is nevertheless powerful.
50899|0|The script by Vincent R. Nebrida ... tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot.
11008|1|Um estudo de personagens maravilhoso que se torna ainda mais eficaz graças ao forte roteiro do mestre Mamet e às performances de um elenco admirável.
75511|1|"From scandalous Hollywood outcast to influential cult classic, Tod Browning's 1932 dark drama about (and starring) freak-show performers is now truly ""one of us""."
66221|1|The vomiting scene is one of the funniest moments ever filmed.
5027|0|Yeah, Chevy Chase & Jack Palance. That'll pack 'em in.
337|1|This Hollywood is the one we want to believe exists: no film school snots here, no MBA's, no dock-worker philosophers-turned-screenwriters. Just a town full of second-rate swindlers where a clear-eyed racketeer can keep his eye on the ball and rise.
91080|1|An ideal comedy
90236|0|There's something kind of strange about a bunch of animals cooking in a kitchen, when many of those animals would normally be getting cooked in a kitchen. But that is the least of this movie's problems.
4215|1|... essential viewing ... to understand Riefenstahl or for anyone curious about how art and politics come out when on a collision course
40746|1|The monologues are chilling, but too many subplots interfere with them.
46589|1|Amiable but predictable.
16888|1|Repulsively thrilling and often downright hilarious.
95413|0|If lots and lots of shooting and wrassling and growling turns your crank, then you might have a good time with Skinwalkers; otherwise, it's a total snore.
63776|0|The Anarchist Cookbook strains for a jazzy, Oliver Stone-ish look, but at its heart it is a placid and conventional moral tale about the dangers of wandering too far off the pathway.
37645|1|Comfortably cheesy -- a real beer-and-pizza movie.
39044|0|The character can only exist among silly, somewhat desperate women. This makes the willing suspension of disbelief a tad tougher for half the viewing populace.
17100|1|Tired of gay rights movies and Holocaust flicks? This is both, but it still enthralls.
48098|1|A searing portrait of kids abandoned by their Romanian parents, products of former dictator Ceausescu's policy banning abortion and contraception.
38054|1|Makes its own quiet impact.
12194|1|Ran is one of the cinema's greatest works, a film of true tragic vision.
9533|1|This classic delivers warmth all year long.
99692|1|In the end, spin wins out over substance, just as it does in every modern American fairy tale.
77322|1|A dated although nonetheless remarkable work of propaganda.
36726|1|'This one won't force out the hankies to dry up the tears because laughter is a more appropriate response to the clichéd script'
45184|1|one of the most memorable of American film noir, a remarkable fusion of hard-boiled mystery and atomic horror
73680|1|[Features] The usual fine performances from Bergman's regulars combined with a script that is not as ponderous as much of the director's other works.
90629|0|The idea is ingenious. The execution? Not so much.
74104|1|[A] difficult and heart-wrenching story of justice perverted.
77128|0|Anacondas might provide some diversion for a rainy Sunday afternoon of TV viewing, but it's not worthy of the big screen.
62834|1|Exciting (but intense) adventure for older kids.
50289|0|The well-made play and once well-thought of film seems to be lifeless when viewed today.
13701|1|Isolationism and false security are as much the targets of the '88 model blob as hobos and horny jocks.
85268|1|The love story may be tenuous, but the penguins are undeniably sweet and silly, sliding on their bellies, and the impossibly cute chicks offer up plenty of slapstick.
81665|1|Spanglish is a heartfelt, funny, sad, human story about what people want and what they should do; about culture's colliding and maintaining their individuality; and about what parents do for their children.
68884|1|This Fellini opus is his most accessible to mass audiences since La Dolce Vita.
17745|0|Uma continuação que copia, cuidadosamente, os mínimos detalhes do filme que a originou.
97511|1|As a character study, There Will Be Blood is unsurpassed. Just don't expect to strike oil straight away.
74135|1|In 1962, the film was deemed audacious due to its handling of such taboo issues as drugs, abortion, and degeneracy, but it's a comromised work which deviates substantially from Tennessee Williams' play.
5272|0|The dysfunctional family in this film is little more than a shameless plot device to introduce a lame father/son bonding adventure.
83742|1|Hugely entertaining.
41424|1|As handled by Hill, the sensationalistic elements seem both natural and marginal. Grier as Foxy would be fun to watch even if she kept her clothes on and her claws in.
38265|0|Overall, it's hit and miss.
82357|1|A forgotten chapter of history that exposes truths about the American dream worth remembering.
26014|0|Sometimes very funny, but wears its sudden tone swings and flurries of profanities like a pair of cement shoes...
56340|0|Erased from Hopper and Sutherlan
55077|0|Formulaic films are released every week, but it's rare that one has a $100 million budget, big stars whose roles are embarrassing to watch and unusual special effects that only serve to mask a predictable plot and cliche-ridden scenes.
44553|1|A fun action-packed fantasy...
101849|1|"There's amusement in this jungle jumble but ""Happy Feet"" left me happier."
43643|1|Woods, as ever, is wired for a fight -- in or outside the courtroom. It's all Downey Jr can do to hold him back.
93726|1|Our instinctual desire to sneer at the implausibility of the story is stalled by a sense of ambition that seems unmatched even by the standards of the Hollywood assembly line.
18887|0|[Bay's] movies are trailers for themselves. Every scene is all climax and no foreplay. When it's all over you can't remember if you've been watching a movie or just a jumbo-sized coming attraction.
57400|1|Blatantly arrogant, unapologetically misogynistic, morally repugnant, and absolutely hypnotic. All these descriptions and more can be applied to the character of Roger Swanson (Campbell Scott)
87220|1|Not quite the animated masterpiece one would expect of Disney of old, but nonetheless a step in the right direction.
94383|1|With shades of Psycho and The Birds, Vacancy sure isn't up there with The Master's finest work but, given that we haven't had a decent horror all year, it's a pleasantly creepy surprise.
94498|0|"Too many villains, too many pale plot strands, too many romantic misunderstandings, too many conversations, too many street crowds looking high into the air and shouting ""oooh!"" this way, then swiveling and shouting ""aaah!"" that way."
38679|1|What's best about the movie is its playfulness.
49442|1|Although spooky, The Devil's Backbone becomes weighed down by perhaps one too many subplots.
64280|1|A scrumptious little film that has good intentions despite a general lack of direction.
70459|1|Cox -- who experienced the Mormon view on gay life firsthand -- gets the sort of performances out of his characters that will help you overlook what is cliched about the story.
30798|0|The Bone Collector is another one of those unpleasant serial-killer movies.
51028|1|"Judicious trimming would have improved the movie, but Johnny Cash-voiced Fred Knittle's opening night rendition of Coldplay's ""Fix You"", dedicated to the recently departed members, is guaranteed to leave not a dry eye in the house."
25435|0|A formula flick.
76341|1|Not as over-the-top as you might hope, but also not as bad. Daft and moderately entertaining.
82592|0|Dramatically, it's a giant flop; and the wooden filmmaking technique only burdens it more. Still, it's hard not to see what wowed audiences in 1930.
30973|0|None of the characters ever rises beyond the level of his or her generic functions, and by the end the overall emptiness of the conception becomes fully apparent.
72657|0|As good as the music is, the overall film only suggests what a flamenco drama might be, leaving the viewer hungry for a more fulfilling realization of the concept.
54359|1|Though it doesn't exactly offer any great shakes in terms of plot or character development, the film's entertaining enough to be watched by kids and adults alike.
61543|1|"There really is no moral to XX/XY except perhaps ""beware of love"""
57655|1|This new Harry Potter has its flaws, but it's better, as well as darker, than the first.
82772|1|Their charm is undeniable, though it mainly resides in the source material: the late 60s, when these were made, were Disney's darkest days for craft and commitment.
88741|0|While the premise of a gross-out spoof of such movies may sound like a good idea in theory, it doesn't make a lot of sense in practice.
72653|0|Depends on your Spaulding Gray tolerance. Mine isn't this high.
62271|1|Though it sounds like an offbeat idea even for horror fans, the tech work is so well done that it could disarm unwary buffs attracted by the campy title.
64148|1|Clever, but not nearly as funny as it thinks it is.
84626|0|As comebacks go, Monster-in-Law may do for Fonda what the Empire State Building did for King Kong.

15895|0|The only resemblances to the classic cartoon are that trees still get in George's way, Shep the elephant still thinks he is a doggie, the ape named Ape still talks, and his girlfriend's name is still Ursula.
2622|0|This is a deeply silly film, highlighting some of Hollywood's most overrated talent at its indulgent, issue-chasing worst.
96676|1|Even if this is no red-blooded shocker, its unsettling mood lingers long past the final fade-out, hinting at all sorts of retribution just lying in wait for polluters.
6327|1|A tough-talking but soft-hearted tale that is entertaining in a sprawling, old-fashioned manner.
102429|0|The film lingers more on Winslet's nudity than on the nature of guilt, and it offers no reason to care for the lumpen criminal or the callow lover.
77912|1|At its heart, this is basically the story of one man's attempt to prove that his life has meaning. What could be more relatable than that?
60302|0|In arguing that calmly and deliberately taking a life can never be justified... it ends up arguing just the opposite. It's bad drama and worse politics.
22733|0|This, one of the most disappointing films of the 1980s, was a dud upon its release and has not held up well at all.
59300|0|A Little Romance is so ponderous it seems almost mean spirited.
100614|0|For all its vivid evocation of its characters' tomorrow-we-die bonhomie, the film finally never quite convinces viewers of its central subject: the sisterly, almost sapphic bond between Vera and Caitlin.
3180|0|Ephron's timing and sensitivity have deserted her, leaving behind only the sentimentality.
48737|1|The best autocritique of cinema as a medium that has yet been made.

1303|1|Taxi Driver is grounded in its socio-political context, yet it also touches on something more universal... how one finds purpose and identity in a collapsing capitalistic society.

101772|0|...only skims the surface of its characters and offers nothing new in the way of corrupt law enforcement.
38401|0|The action in this case is fitful, the acting semaphoric, the narrative movement clunky and the plot ultimately self-canceling.
12715|1|Weir infuses the film with his customary mysticism, but more importantly, draws sensitive performances from his largely inexperienced cast.
17405|1|It's like, you know, pretty groovy, man.
65567|0|For all its failures in other areas - a bloated, heavy farce, or a character comedy full of generally tedious cartoons - its abysmal shortcomings as a musical are the saddest.
89653|1|Yamada's enormously enjoyable The Hidden Blade is a movie that deftly balances the obligations of samurai history with love story.

70629|0|Basically, what you get with Ocean's Thirteen is more of the same, but less.
55799|0|Watching movies like this, it's easy to understand actresses' common complaint about the quality of roles for women of a certain age.
61674|1|Peckinpah's semi-fascist tale works both ways: as a dream of male territorial revenge, and as female rape fantasy taken to a shockingly unexpected end.
62892|1|The photography is brilliant, the best of any of Flaherty's work.
41852|0|A victim of its own hyped publicity and too harsh criticism, Ishtar is not the worst movie ever made or even a bomb, just a dim-witted silly comedy-thriller (with some good jokes) based on the casting against type of Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman.
101164|0|Eska's tale of a woman's unconditional support of her father-in-law is told with a faux-poetic sensibility that never really connects with his characters' lives.
74189|1|Cinema at its most exhilarating.
64004|0|Serrano's frequently mystifying device of having Lucía's cardboard psyche mess with the audience's minds is ultimately a confusing bore.

96419|1|Lars And The Real Girl is a film without compare, about as far removed from conventional comedy as it's possible to be.
51484|1|The script includes a verbal motif that reminds us of what binds the film's four central talents together: 'I want to show you something.' [Blu-Ray review]
67741|1|As tense and effective now as it was 25 years ago. The worry back then was more about Soviet missiles than about credit card identity theft, but good filmmaking techniques haven't changed.
76380|1|It introduces us to sharply defined, rather odd characters and then lets them mix it up. The movie is episodic, and some of the episodes are brilliant.
43557|1|The film is relentlessly arty and much too stylistically bizarre for mainstream taste ... But it has its own peculiar charm.
16026|0|...the strong impact that Gibson makes as damaged goods is diluted by selling Jerry as cute and redeemable.
60052|1|if only filmmakers out there would take a how-to course on making romantic comedies with more than just laughs and star appeal, we might actually be making some progress.
48756|0|Actress Lahti's feature directorial debut is a disappointingly sappy melodrama about the unlikely bond between a rebebllious high-school grad (Leelee Sobieski) and a dying older man (Albert Brooks).
29250|1|Makes up for a dearth of scares with cheeky self-referentiality.
49237|0|Wong's efficiently creepy Final Destination was as much memento mori as teen disposal unit, but in The One the maze of death leads only to exhaustion.
27949|1|Despite this only being his third feature and his first with a significant budget, Kubrick displays many of the thematic preoccupations and visual traits that would come to define his unique, cinematic voice.
48673|0|Eighth rate tired, unimaginative mob comedy.
98722|0|Leaves its stain less on [Luke] Wilson than on the fellows who are trying to harness his smirk and his persona without the delicate touch that [Wes] Anderson and Wilson made look easy.
58415|0|This is pretty close to one of the worse movies that I've ever seen and having to recap it is making my brain bleed..
40534|0|The old magic fails to re-materialize, thanks to overwrought melodrama and contrived plot developments.
44043|1|Mature dramedy has drug/alcohol abuse, cursing.
13068|1|Fried Green Tomatoes is a cut above superficially similar 'women's pictures'.
56099|1|Bouncy animation and catchy songs keep the film from tasting too much like spinach.
97726|1|[W]orks... as bright, cheery, satisfying fantasy, if a mere trifle of a passing fancy. And it works, too, as a celebration of female don't-ignore-us indignation...
50814|1|The quality of this acerbic study of life in a Korean War field hospital has been too often overlooked because of the popularity of the TV series it spawned.
88961|1|Reveling in politically incorrect humor, Reitman takes no prisoners in his debut feature that tackles everything from political hypocrisy to baby seals.

31974|1|quiet drama that settles into the memory like a story Grandma might tell
72061|0|Too broadly played and not at all funny enough, in spite of the milking of a high concept.
14935|0|Take away the ethnic/pregnancy angles, and we've seen this premise countless times -- all the way back to the spate of post-World War II romances about returning veterans and the mates they married in a blink.

26633|0|From the director of American Beauty comes another empty, fake-meaningful tale of how rotten it is in the suburbs.
99858|1|As a film critic who has spent too many summers viewing mediocre misfires and uninspired reinterpretations of TV shows, comic books and cult classics, it's immensely satisfying to recommend something as breathtakingly glorious as WALL-E.
91053|1|Some adults may not enjoy 'How To Eat Fried Worms.' But that doesn't matter: this one is strictly for the kids -- who will no doubt eat it up.

75510|1|"[VIDEO ESSAY] In spite of the tremendous success he enjoyed with ""Dracula"" in 1931, Tod Browning's directorial career was effectively ruined after he made ""Freaks"" the following year."
23152|1|For all of its grossly stereotypical characterizations and cheap laughs, My Cousin Vinny does benefit from Pesci's characteristically energetic performance. And co-star Tomei looks very nice in a clinging blue dress with gold lame applique.
30906|1|All of the pieces of Creepshow come together in a smorgasbord of ghastly images, welcome humor, and solid, old-fashioned storytelling.
12078|1|This disturbing vision of the harrowing effects of war and violence continues to shock and haunt audiences.
66355|1|For all the explicit violence, the film is less gritty noir than ebullient, good-natured fantasy.

90153|1|"with a name like ""Sharpay,"" it's gotta be good"
97877|0|'Strange Wilderness' isn't funny enough to produce anything more than a few slight chuckles. We mostly groan and squirm in our seats while watching it.
72615|0|A tired, formualic Western that reahashes elements of True Grit, John Wayne's Oscar-winning film, and The African Queen (Hepburn and Bogey), but it's the only teaming of the iconic Duke and Hepburn, so you may want to see it as a tribute to aging stars
66868|0|A large step backwards for a promising director and far from the return we'd been hoping for.
58529|0|It's push-the-limits teen comedy, the type written by people who can't come up with legitimate funny, and it's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed.
90546|0|Not only is there nothing there, the nothingness is a complete bore. When a film's highpoint is a soundtrack that relies heavily on other soundtracks, you've got problems.
31712|1|The charm of the gimmick in Lubitsch's take is passed over quickly in favor of studying both its effects on those involved, as well as the dynamics of the workplace at large.
59937|0|Pretty bad, but in a way, we'd be disappointed if it wasn't...it's all about Campbell, a limber linguist whose verbal sense seems straight out of the '40s, and a game physical comic. [Blu-ray]

56542|0|The fourth in a series that I'll bet most parents had thought --hoped! -- was a fad that had long since vanished.
82475|0|White noise is intended to help you fall asleep. White Noise would never let you do that, though. It's far too interested in a cacophony of cheap scares.

15131|1|[Haggis] makes his directing debut with a screenplay that often seems rigged and contrived, but comes to life via excellent acting and a philosophical argument that bigotry and benevolence are inextricably intertwined.

29320|0|The story idea is an interesting one, but it doesn't quite pan out in the end. There are too many unanswered questions and unresolved conflicts.

28986|1|The cast is uniformly good, with Bacon giving the strongest performance as blue-collar Tom.
92801|0|"Tolerable, but far from magical, ""Happily N'Ever After"" is just another one of what is becoming a genre: Lackluster CGI_animated films."
54994|0|And if you appreciate the one-sided theme to Lawrence's over-indulgent tirade, then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified Martin Lawrence lovefest. If you are willing to do this, then you so crazy!

24991|1|Van Der Beek and Voight weigh in with convincing performances .
79572|1|There is intellectual rigour, cinematographer Gianni Di Venanzo's discombobulating use of angles and aspect and that superb no-show last scene.
71049|1|A challenging and thought-provoking film.
12183|1|It's the intimacy of even the most gargantuan conflict that hits home in Kurosawa's masterful hands.

73406|1|One of the most bittersweet films of Peckinpah's career.

61583|1|Levy and O’Hara have a wonderful rapport developed from their days on SCTV...
91121|1|Though it doesn't ride quite as smoothly as that Hummer limo Magdalena fantasizes over, the film succeeds as a heartfelt slice-of-life examining a culture too often ignored in film.
35707|1|When critics discuss chemistry, that onscreen magic that occurs between perfectly paired actors, the electricity exemplified by Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon is a textbook illustration of same.
16548|1|Bujold has the frazzled hauteur of an aging, neglected star, and Spelling is nicely glazed, studiously artless. But the film is keyed to Posey's performance: perfectly brittle, faultlessly false.
27288|0|Never quite gets off the ground either, since none of its characters, human or simulated, is all that soulful to begin with.
47628|1|Funny and pathetically accurate portrait of an obsessed wanna-be
93203|0|...irredeemably uneventful and - ultimately - hopelessly derivative...
14713|1|A good movie based on H.G. Wells' classic novel.
27822|1|In both the funny and the (mildly) scary moments, the cast does itself proud.
12873|1|Forget Citizen Kane. As a matter of history, this seminal film is unquestionably the finest work of cinema ever made. Required viewing for all students and fans of the art form.
48304|1|Hasn't aged especially well. Still, on the strength of Grant and co-lead Tony Curtis, Edwards' film remains a diverting enough escape from reality. [Blu-ray]

84632|1|Através das belíssimas atuações de Pepper e da estreante Piugattuk, a narrativa desenvolve-se com calma até atingir um clímax emocional inesperado, mas eficiente.
162|1|Check your political correctness at the door and have a blast -- this is the best Bond since The Spy Who Loved Me.
50833|0|The outcome is predictable, and the prospectively livelier second half never breaks free from the torpor of the prison scenes.
47215|1|Terrific fun for girls and their families, too.
15679|0|As the film progresses, however, it begins to accumulate all sorts of unnecessary characters and subplots that only serve to weigh it down.
48728|1|[Reboux's] heartbreaking performance makes the movie quite watchable in spite of its obvious flaws.
31929|1|Everything about the film looks and feels authentic, from the desolate landscape dotted with trailers and fast-food joints to the people who populate a borderland that offers none of them much hope.
69135|1|With a heavily improvised script Cassavetes gets the most from his actors, each giving emotive performances.
26668|0|It's often all too easy to see where the plot's headed; tiny holes and bigger ones open up under the story.
19880|1|This kill-happy sequel is a lot bloodier than needed, but it's still pretty frightening nevertheless.
5956|1|Grade B Mel Brooks has some zany moments.
30134|1|Still ranks in the upper echelon of the Bond series.
48300|1|A sharp and entertaining adaptation of the Lillian Hellman play.
35239|1|The specter of the film lingers long after it's over, and the memory of it grows more affectionate.
85560|0|...a crude Jerry Bruckheimer knock-off with a laughably insipid script...
3388|1|This is an outstanding drama that provides an excellent opportunity for examining the way that people make moral choices.
81573|1|Burman explored this world before in 2000's Waiting for the Messiah, but in Lost Embrace, his maturity results in a much tighter and engaging film.
63371|1|Not sophisticated, by any degree, but highly effective nonetheless.
23251|1|Lynch's powerful depiction of Merrick (played by John Hurt) moves a viewer from revulsion and fear to empathy and tenderness. That's the very movement of the story itself.
93008|0|You know you're in trouble the second you take a look at Bruce Willis's fake liver spots.
46177|1|Director Ivan Reitman more than delivers on the wacky promise of Twins in this nutty, storybook tale of siblings separated at birth and reunited at age 35.
10924|1|...might just be the ultimate wacky '80s comedy...
1682|1|Rob Roy benefits from a smart script and fine performances by art house regulars Tim Roth and Eric Stoltz, as well as Hollywood stars Liam Neeson and Jessica Lange.
25029|0|It's a terrible, terrible movie, but one that oddly warrants at least one viewing for the masochistic and morbidly curious.
101982|1|The movie teems with the excitement of unwrapping a present, even as it deals more seriously with the intractability of blood ties.
97065|1|A subversive and annihilistic satire on America, lurching from black comedy to farce, from dramatic insight to superficial jokes
50034|0|Iris fails to enlighten us into either the tragedy of Alzheimer's disease or the woman that it strikes.
28193|1|Affectionately eavesdrops on the past and gives everyone a wonderful opportunity to re-imagine what it was like when this communications medium was king.
18198|0|The film lacks the anarchic weirdness of some of his best, and without the camp elements it becomes obvious just how like a telenovela the goings-on are.
67499|1|Quel est le poids de l'amour, de la vengeance et de la culpabilité? À vous de le découvrir.
82761|1|Most people will dislike this movie, or at least be bored to tears by it. I enjoyed it.
45011|0|Directionless sequel that once again proves that the pictures that are the most fun to make aren't necessarily the most fun to watch.
69607|1|If the love story is asked to carry more weight than it can bare, at least this is a film of rich measure and ambition.

50147|1|Some Body will take you places you haven't been, and also places you have.
69734|0|When one of the writers is nicknamed 'Coke,' I guess you have to expect this. But that still doesn't mean you need to be subjected to it.
58301|1|Overall, it feels like Crystal, De Niro, and director Ramis have settled into a familiarity with the material and each other that allows for richer comedic chemistry and improvisation.
101869|1|Bottom line: it's a better Bond movie than most, but not as good as Casino Royale.
85823|0|performances are so unreal and lifeless that I kept expecting to see mechanical parts start dangling out of the people's heads.
68791|1|Vintage Woody Allen.
774|1|Has a spirit and an ostensible shapelessness that are pure Cassavetes, enveloping a script that only seems to reach for the precise calculations of 1930s screwball comedy.
79461|0|The kind of insipid hero-worship that traps the subject in wax
10334|1|Leigh's best work yet is indisputably screen art, but it's a flesh-and-blood 'people' movie, too.
52820|0|"There's a frantic, anything-goes quality to ""Sweetest"" that's appealing at first, until it becomes apparent the movie has little more to offer than the friskiness of its stars..."
46330|0|O'Neal's performance, on the other hand, could incite angels to throw tomatoes from heaven.
95056|0|Sad, slow and rather boring story about how writers get dumped on and smart television shows get dumbed down.
102285|1|It's pretentious, arch, and often times ridiculous (as well as being philosophically incoherent, trying to sound smarter than it actually is), but it's in the end a lot of fun.
102341|1|The film's narrative flow is less driven by events, which are revealed in spurts, but are drawn along as their inevitable consequences.
91515|1|Shot with digital camera on location in Mexico, Mel Gibson has created a visually stunning action/adventure epic that although has divided many with its historical accuracy, has spared no expense in bringing life to a world before European colonization.
31542|0|Though the saucy French soufflé has a few tasty moments it mostly sinks into being tasteless fare.
3199|0|Only the least demanding audiences can be expected to buy into Milk Money.

31482|1|Obvious, but very moving.
905|1|The most amazing thing about Will Ferrell is that he can make absolutely nothing funny.
37312|1|A tremendously good sequel, on top of being a tremendously good movie in and of itself - surely the best Italian Western at the time of its release.
62065|1|On a miniscule budget, Ghobadi conveys the terror of war, while the beautifully edited sequence in which Iranian villagers make bricks resembles nothing so much as a choreographed dance number.
98756|0|One can't help but think there was a smarter film to be made from this premise.
72306|1|"Perfectly enjoyable sci-fi re-take on ""Hell in the Pacific."""
82209|1|Million Dollar Baby, above all else, feels like a work that comes out of years of living, and years of experience with people, and knowing what works and what doesn't. It also comes from a director who is still able to be touched when two people connect.
19368|1|After a season of watching inane twitching in the name of dance, the viewer is most happily greeted by Onna White's choreography, an exuberant step-by-step exploration of Victorian zeal.
53463|1|Unfaithful is not so much about the conventions of a typical bored housewife falls for exotic foreigner with disastrous results story, but in fact plumbs the depths of what really constitutes intimacy, and how complacency, rather than the melodramatic ups
11195|1|Photographed mostly in tight traveling shots with an occasional long shot evoking a sense of foreboding and entrapment, the movie is claustrophobic, harried, sexually charged.
30303|0|The story is dumb. The actors are dumb. Even the special effects are dumb. But not half as dumb as you'll feel if you pay to get in.
79044|1|The production is ordinary and would rank as just one more gangster film but for two things. One is the excellence of Mr. Burnett's credible and compact story. The other is Edward G. Robinson's wonderfully effective performance.
55074|0|Complete with a Xanadu-style dance routine, Pam Grier as Pluto's mother indulging in tired blaxploitation moves and rent-a-cameo John Cleese as a virtual reality chauffeur, this is a flop of epic proportions.
56590|1|For what I suppose must be classified as a 'teen thriller,' this film has a surprising amount of substance.
96918|1|A glowing valentine to creativity in opposition to commerce.
82257|1|Cheadle has an Oscar nomination for best actor. But this isn't a grandstanding portrayal: it is a performance at the service of the work.

24355|1|Prancer deserves to join the select ranks of those Christmas movies we return to again and again.
77832|1|The final quarter of the film is actually rather bloody, almost living up to the promise of the trailer. It's actually rather subtle for a horror flick, but is really good just the same.
41258|1|Its famous ending may be hokey, but in a movie this honest, it couldn't feel more right.
93063|1|This screen adaptation of Katherine Paterson's now-classic novel for young readers tells its story with agreeable simplicity in between computer-generated monsters.
87634|1|Its scares are on a much more basic level than in, say, a thriller by Hitchcock. It works mostly by exploiting our fear of the dark.
74564|1|Hardly a knockout, but Megamind is an immensely enjoyable animated adventure that spoofs and pays homage to the superhero genre.
87480|1|A depressing illustration of how even Middle America has ended up marginalized and rudderless in the wake of outsourcing, downsizing and globalization.
66356|1|Strong adaptation of Chester Himes' pulp thriller

6823|1|A minor but quirkily charming comedy about alientaion, love, and folly that reflects the zeitgeist in terms of AIDS and modern technology.
97832|0|This is supposed to be a spoof of '300.' But 'Meet the Spartans' isn't a satire of anything. It's just a bunch of body-function-based skits that randomly feature scenes from movies and television shows -- and not a single one of them is laugh-inducing
59347|1|Wilder is at his frantic best, ably supported by the likes of real-life wife Gilda Radner and Midnight Run's Charles Grodin.
79824|1|It's the camera trickery and the playful art direction that send up the entire image of the badass yakuza to begin with.
69287|1|One not to miss.
37147|1|Teleporting Zombies! Hanging priests! Bleeding eyes! Organ regurgitation! The plot is meaningless and the characters senseless. But these are pluses for films in this cycle.
49008|0|For all the sex and vicious psychological game-playing, Chereau's movie is strangely forgettable.
73305|1|The Jan Brady of the filmmaker's trilogy of puberty-agonizing explorers
46582|1|A cute movie that heralded the return of Travolta and unfortunately also spawned a franchise that would not die.
39569|0|Doesn't live up to its pedigree.
81830|1|protagonist's narration puts the film's complex plot into much broader economic, political and cultural context.
38722|0|I had more interest in the secondary characters.
11910|1|It is technically even more proficient [than Star Wars], has virtually the same ingredients and bursts forth into a world that still seems ripe for its special blend of nostalgically simple story-telling and complicated technology.
51426|1|The master class in piquant flash tends to Hollywood's warts like sumptuous flowers
1452|1|I enjoyed the relentless gloomy realism, the refusal to put a happy face on McCourt's miserable childhood.
68815|1|Pretty good romantic comedy that's a bit too cute.
58162|1|...just the sort of fast-paced adventure flick that today's kids aren't getting enough of.
23428|1|dares to laugh in the face of the unthinkable. And because Benigni can be heart-rending without a trace of the maudlin, it works.
48785|0|It takes a full hour before anything interesting happens (believe me, I checked)...
90495|0|I understand the satirical import of the race gags. But 97% of the movie will make you need a shower. Possibly two.
2929|1|Beautiful to look at and dripping with atmosphere
64118|1|Stage actor Robert Stephens brilliantly plays Holmes with a nod and a wink.
256|0|Simultaneously quite watchable and passionless.
100582|0|Comes off as a semi-absurd variant of the horror mystique cheating the potentials of impeccable production values.
72287|1|The original queer tragicomedy
70304|1|Wajda tends toward harsh and overstated imagery, but he achieves a fascinating psychological rapport with his lead actor, Zbigniew Cybulski.
15000|1|The Man With No Eyebrows will go down in my books as the single greatest fictitious creation of all time.
87747|1|It is a handsome production, an epic fantasy for younger audiences with a spiritual message, and it was followed by two more films in the series. This one remains the most satisfying and inspiring.
15053|1|A film that has much to recommend it, not least the proof it offers, as if any more were needed, that Alfonso Cuarón is one of the most visually inspired directors working today.
82195|0|The all-star cast do their best, but the individual stories are so truncated that they can't do much in the way of giving their characters real emotional depth.
100261|1|Wajda's intensity and passion, as well as his intelligence and craft, are unmistakable from the very first sequence. Virtually from the first shot.
54668|1|Happy Times sounds like any of the dozens of heart-tugging comedies that Miramax seems to release every month, but it has such a peculiar premise and the central performance by Zhao Benshan is so winning that Zhang gets away with it by the skin of
47135|0|At one point Bernie is shown dancing under the sea, an accurate metaphor for the film itself -- which is also dead in the water.
17774|0|Hush is gussied up by its classy distaff cast members, but remains trashy all the same.
64702|0|Schlock most famous due to Roger Ebert's screenplay.
41858|0|The model for awful comedies
49200|1|It's funny, the characters are endearing, the monster world is cleverly developed, and the Pixar gang really has fun with this one.
100276|1|I might even go out on a limb and actually say that Meet Dave is, um, good.
45488|1|Enough of a social commentary to make it worthwhile
36795|0|Dinosaur mixes state-of-the-art visuals with bottom-of-the-barrel scripting.
58545|0|The rags-to-riches plot should keep hopeless romantics happy, but you just can't help wondering what Hugh Grant, Sandra Bullock and a team of decent joke writers might have achieved with this one.
99951|1|Intriguing family story of the sunny and dark sides of extreme home-schooling by surfing, through a trove of photos, home movies, and reminiscences, but little insight.
82051|1|Against all odds, it's ultimately an uplifting experience.
99550|0|"The Scooby Doo ending requires nearly ten minutes of explanation and negates the need to follow the previous 90 minutes. It's also preceded by one character stating, ""In life, nobody bothers explaining anything."" Well, except in this movie."
5290|1|Heaven and Earth has the epic scope one would expect from a film of this magnitude, but it lacks much of the narrative strength of Stone's first two Vietnamese tales.
18644|0|Six Days. Seven Nights. Eight dollars wasted.
54900|0|Eastwood should spend the next five years gargling to get rid of the taste.
26586|1|Offers high energy, a fascinating backdrop and a top-flight cast, but has an unfortunate tendency to veer off the runway.
96189|0|This documentary starts out as a fascinating profile of consumer advocate Ralph Nader, but it ends up getting derailed by a political discussion marked by an abundance of whining.
53812|1|The young Mifune is a marvelous dichotomy, his restless energy checked by a veneer of surface calm: the composed social face and fierce turmoil underneath.
95375|1|...charming and enchanting and adventurous and romantic and funny and hugely entertaining.
51594|0|Vapid, disjointed drivel.
31262|0|Never gets beyond stereotypes.
30790|0|A desperate send-up of authentic evil, a True Crime! tabloid 'zine thriller packaged with all the subtlety and restraint of children's toothpaste.
6502|0|[The movie has] an inconsistency of mood not helped by abrupt editing and Columbus' sometimes self-conscious direction.
13000|1|The Western is back. With a vengeance. Saddle up or get out of the way.
10777|1|Gorgeous to look at, thoughtful, but marred by star Garner's insistene that he not appear gay
6266|0|"Not a bad twist on ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" but a lot more could have been done with it."
101321|1|The characters are so well defined, the acting so top-notch and the cinematography so stunning, I was able to forgive what I saw as script issues.
53510|1|Expertly acted throughout, this remains a definitive snapshot of British life in the 1980s.
3610|1|Stylish avant-garde experimental psychological thriller.
21446|1|Surprisingly sweet and funny!
31871|1|A decent film that thinks it's more important than it actually is.
31415|1|A far cry from the gore-drenched Saving Private Ryan, legendary producer Darryl F. Zanuck's heartfelt recreation of the D-Day landings is, in its own way, every bit as memorable.
69361|1|It's easy to stand back and wax ironic about The Last Samurai. But it's not all that difficult to succumb to its full-spirited romanticism either.
60798|1|This is not a film about narrative but loneliness and life on the road, which it captures with a mysterious brilliance.
93950|0|It jumps from typical action one-liners to political discussions about Abu Ghraib. I mean, you can't have a character named Swagger and expect me to take you seriously.
50735|0|For some reason, Disney keeps making really, really crappy live-action films.
79136|1|It has a good cast and the production values were first-class, allowing it to rise slightly above its hackneyed script.
65969|1|...an intriguing, deeply interesting film that over the course of almost three decades has acquired a prescient quality, but it's also schlock; a kind of cyberpunk rewrite of Network that indulges Cronenberg's taste for venereal horror.
99710|1|The Promotion does sacrifice some comedy in its attempt at depth.
30430|1|If Crimes and Misdemeanors isn't Woody Allen's best blending of drama and comedy, it's most certainly in the running.
19578|1|Fine acting, subtle direction, good writing, in fact, a film for everyone to appreciate and enjoy.
10373|0|If Beautiful Thing were any more sensitive, it would faint.
81783|0|They float, encounter sharks, float, encounter jellyfish, float, encounter more sharks...zzzzzz. With...tension-inducing music, this film could have been a real nail-biter.

43371|0|Freddy Got Fingered is pure masturbation, and I'm sorry to say I mean that both literally and figuratively.
75335|1|A gentle reminder of just how much life and movies have changed -- not entirely for the better.
7363|1|Funny and intelligent, despite some flaws.
69910|0|Though it has a potentially funny cast, this sprawling comedy has been made in a near-total wit vacuum.
87150|0|It's not worth the bother.
51373|0|Comedy troupe Broken Lizard's first movie is very funny but too concerned with giving us a plot.

34213|1|War is hell, but for Peckinpah it's also the sadist's Olympian joke
23050|1|There's plenty of action in this computer-animated comedy, but it's no match for Toy Story in humor and originality.
31500|1|'80s romcom has mature themes; may not interest kids.
45891|0|The people who made this movie should be ashamed of themselves.
67465|0|What sick mind thought this was appropriate humor for a holiday movie geared to youngsters?
61370|1|It's a mixture of the military/industrial complex paranoia of The X-Files, the deadpan style of Sam Spade and the wisdom of Confucius-lite.
31373|1|It's a relaxed, colorful creation, remaining true to rascally human behaviors while respecting the unifying power of music. Downright irresistible.
81858|1|For a debut, it's downright startling.
78897|1|Rarely have I seen ninety more compelling minutes on the screen.
71608|1|...a passable yet forgettable action extravaganza.
28362|0|The magic is now gone because we've seen the wizard's tricks.
5577|1|Fierce, violent and searing in its observation, the film makes previous excursions seem like a stroll through the park.
39390|0|Numbingly incoherent.
62103|1|Has enough gags to transcend its saccharine and predictable plot.
26915|0|Another silly Mummy sequel, with Chaney still shuffling around looking for his lost love.

101280|1|Import Export adds the welcome element of humanity to stand between the cruelty and humor.
51640|1|Where the film fails as a narrative - and it fails rather mightily in places - it succeeds as a mood piece.
12051|1|One of Hollywood's finest achievements, To Kill A Mockingbird is truly timeless.
44831|1|At the heart of the movie is Ebouaney's performance as Lumumba, every bit as intense as Denzel Washington's as Malcolm X.
39344|0|The thinking is, if faced with a dead sequence in the editing room, flood it with light, or break it up with jump cuts, or leech the color out, or blur the image in some arty way. Whatever. It still looks dead.
68844|1|Forster's novel is one of the literary landmarks of this century, and now David Lean has made it into one of the greatest screen adaptations I have ever seen.
54237|0|Unambitious writing emerges in the movie, using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook.
45385|1|Larry Clark has an astonishing way of getting into the minds of teenagers.
40487|1|Malèna barely speaks a word in the film, but Belucci makes a role that is written as a symbol into a full-blooded person.
8018|0|This may be a case where you have to read the book to appreciate the film, but if that's true, the film hasn't done its job.
16650|0|You might actually anticipate learning something about the real JohnnyHolmes and his vocational choices. Think again.
52120|1|A Western Nirvana
78814|0|Whenever there's something that might be funny, we're socked over the head with sentimentality and our need for laughter evaporates.
71283|0|Famed for his way with words, it's as if Mamet has tried to outdo himself here, but without the trademark humour that might've lifted this otherwise constipated Tom Clancy knock-off.
29441|0|Imperfect.
66870|0|...merely a good ending in search of a proper build-up.
24178|0|Stay home and watch the genuine article instead.
73031|1|Not a total success perhaps, but still a striking and sensitive effort.
35599|1|"Despite the negative hullabaloo ""Midnight Express"" provoked for its brutal characterization of Turkish prison officials, director Alan Parker's rendering of Oliver Stone's exploitation screenplay is a stick of pure cinematic dynamite."
97812|0|Disappointing dance drama that suffers from a badly scripted plot, dull performances and poorly choreographed dance routines.
27087|1|"This was the classic that single-handedly revived traditional British Gothic and firmly placed the ""Hammer House of Horror"" on the global gore map."
55863|1|A note of genuine sadness sneaks through at the end, but for the most part, enjoying 8 Women involves coming to terms with its artificiality and learning to appreciate it from a distance. Behind all that thick glass, it's still a work of art.
96442|1|The film unfolds brilliantly and methodically, as director Gavid Hood's vivid characters are unwittingly drawn together.
45666|1|gritty and gripping
80100|1|One of the better movies about the Great Depression.
5089|1|Demolition Man is a significant artifact of our time or, at least, of this week.
93778|0|Despite its attempt at being well-meaning family genre fare a la E.T., The Last Mimzy simply collapses under the considerable weight of its many bewildering plot elements.
48572|1|[Marvin's] understated authority and sincerity give the entire film a dignity it would otherwise lack.
98104|1|The writing is clever, the acting is good, and this is pretty much as good a chick flick as you're going to get.
79542|0|As the deadlier of the refugee criminals, Steve Cochran is almost as mean as his colleague, Chill Wills, is picturesque. Their resourceful efforts would be more effective if the drama, as directed by Sam Peckinpah, did not move at the pace of a hearse.
86458|0|[The film is]...so bad that I found myself almost nodding out during long scenes of Alba swimming underwater in a skimpy suit.
64106|1|Fast and funny, but very stagey, satire of Cold War politics.
69853|0|Though lush in nearly every way, under the reproachful eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg, The Great Gatsby becomes ineffectual and rudderless.
99097|1|The movie's relentless dream-like quality could induce slack-jawed wonder...or chronic narcolepsy depending how receptive the viewer is to non-linear narrative and super-stylised flights of fancy.
87106|1|Each woman has to turn herself inside out in continuous time. It has the demands of theatre and the intimacy of cinema.
11795|1|It's easy to imagine what My Left Foot might have looked like in the hands of a lesser director like, say, Ron Howard.
33639|0|It's one thing to make a film that's violent and profane; it's another to make one that's a moral black hole, and to do it because black looks cool. [Blu-ray]
78054|1|The film, like its source, is filled with pessimistic fatalism, but it spares no pity for the instruments of fate [...] What, if anything, this meant to Polanski remains unknowable.
32509|0|This was never quite the major assault on sexism and male chauvinism it set itself up to be.
57834|1|One of the best horror movies of 2002
33703|1|The film engages the audience on a gut level so that we care about Kim and Prentice.
45628|0|Caddyshack II is the kind of film that sends careers spiraling downward.
7472|0|The 1970s-style special effects do little to distract us from an uneven script, direction and performances. Yet there's enough here for us to hope it'll come together.
68244|1|Surprisingly sharp comedy.
91520|0|What this thing turns out to be is a skimpy action flick.
73616|1|"Designed neither to warm your heart nor shelter you in the comfort of liberal guilt, the movie does what so many style-conscious, ""subjective"" documentaries have long forgotten how to do. It shows you a world, and stays the hell out of it."
17117|1|Absolutely frightening. Makes Dennis the Menace look like a little angel.
38520|1|At 160 minutes, Anatomy is longer than the subject warrants, but the pace seldom slackens -- thanks to the competence of Director Otto Preminger.
50308|0|While making a great looking biopic that is filled with detail, Michal Mann forgot to make a film that entertains, creating an emotionally void, tone flat portrait of an athlete whose contribution socially and culturally has yet to be matched.
71602|0|The problem with this movie is that it needed to be funny.
102023|1|This one's only fair, but it has its low-down wiles and its moments.

101241|0|This angry black man wants a 'chocolate drop' of his own -- yes, 'chocolate drop' is actually used in this film! However, it's such a weak movie that you won't get offended.
90224|0|It's innocuous, knockabout stuff with the usual touristic London rather garishly photographed.
29712|1|Writer/director Paul Brickman has honed a sharp satire on American go-getting here.
59363|1|Costa-Gavras deserves credit for staying the course; in a time when most European film directors are wringing their hands, he's still pointing fingers.
2072|0|Appalling, immoral rubbish palmed off as art.
82670|1|The impeccably played Mikey & Nicky moves with such certainty and glory that it emerges as an underrated masterpiece.
26749|1|The irreverence at the perceived end of the world constitutes Night of the Comet's biggest selling point: borrowing some of the cheekiness that George A. Romero used so well, and making it the main dish rather than the garnish.
13139|1|Highlander is the visual counterpart to rock band Queen (who supply a number of songs on the soundtrack) - big, brash and operatic filmmaking of the highest order.
350|1|A complete delight. See it!
55768|1|The movie's central premise -- is well supported in a film whose strength is in its close-ups on characters and its ability to put the viewer in the cell with them.
38809|1|...the filmmakers clearly intended the movie to be a carefree caper, and if one views it that way, it can pass an entertaining few hours.
88575|1|A decent distraction for the young ones, it also seems content to be merely that.
40836|0|None of the jokes are funny, sex is referred to far too often, and Seann William Scott's acting is beyond the pale.
35637|1|Mildly engaging but well acted romantic melodrama, especially by James Garner, who received his first and only Best Actor Oscar nomination for playing a small-town pharmacist.
14520|0|Grisham for exceptionally bleeding hearts
26952|1|'No wire hangers -- ever!' That this apparently banal phrase has now achieved something like immortality is a reflection of the unbridled extravagance of Faye Dunaway's performance.

37467|1|A brainless, breathless thrill.
20970|1|You wonder how on earth Altman did it; equally often, you feel you are watching a wacky masterpiece, the like of which you've never seen before.
37310|1|Leone's artful editing of close-ups to communicate the characters' spatial relationships is always a pleasure.
90924|1|Honest, unflinching and worthy of reappraisal.
17431|1|How mysterious and intriguing some performances can be.
33249|1|Lamoclm X may seem conventional by Spike Lee's standards, but as a biopic of a controversial historical figure, it's superior to the nobility of spirit of a movie like Gandhi, for example, and Attenborough's high-mindedness.
102198|1|Much of the film depends on our ability to suspend disbelief and see the world as Bruno sees it. It has a finale designed to shock.
47145|1|One of the great movies of the 1960's.
77189|1|Although long and disjointed, with characters...from Gone With the Wind, and burdened by (terrible) audio..., Vanity Fair is an entertaining film that held my interest.

9763|1|A lyrical love poem to food and family (or is it family or food?), this serio comedy joins the company of other fun movies about eating, such as Babette's Feast and Like Water for Chocolate.
9594|1|"""The 39 Steps"" isn't groundbreaking, but it's an extremely solid mystery thriller. Hitchcock always managed to keep the audience guessing and always had them in the palm of his hand. ""The 39 Steps"" still accomplishes that."
63096|0|The movie is billed as a romantic musical comedy. You coulda fooled me.
85277|0|Though it seems like a somewhat wasted opportunity to shed some light on these creatures, you can't fault Mr. Jacquet for his efforts.
71882|1|It rattles along well enough as a thriler of the political paranoia variety.
71878|0|A muddled thriller ... Peckinpah seems more interested in shooting laughable action sequences and exposing the bare breasts of his actresses than in relating a coherent story.

81220|1|Ball knows how to fit his themes in seamlessly, weaving a charming, dark, funny, thoroughly entertaining parody of Americana.
12970|1|Director Harold Ramis uses every cinematic trick in the book to keep what is essentially a one-gag movie brimming with life and fresh ideas.
70285|1|An exquisite screen interpretation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's unfinished novel on Hollywood during the Thirties
84357|1|A tense melodrama...

25916|1|Logan's Run is not great filmmaking, but it's a nice sci-fi thriller with an interesting enough plot to keep it propelling along.
65026|1|Earth hits all the right notes, and if Disney corners the market on nature documentaries and creates an annual cinematic event of this caliber tied into Earth Day, so be it.
100041|1|With a plethora of violent and drug-related movies streaming into theaters faster than a Star Wars battleship, the heartfelt Kit Kittredge offers an enjoyable breath of fresh air.
34880|0|Mo' Better Blues, in thrall to the cliches of the star-is-born musicals of the past, is a stillborn academic exercise.
52767|0|Paxton steals the show. And O'Leary more than holds his own again here. Too bad it's in a movie that fails to live up to its potential.
80574|1|More melodramatic and operatic than any of Woo's subsequent films.
11847|1|A brave, convention-challenging sex farce about the ties that bind us in love.
70907|0|This movie lacks any complexity. Dutton opts instead to embellish the story with boxing clichés.
15773|1|It is the visual imagery of the sheep, the wool being dyed, the rugs being made that take center stage.
45535|1|Apartment Zero is a psychological drama that is part black comedy and part erotic thriller.

79406|1|a paragon of magical realism that transports the ancient Greek myth into the then-modern realm of postwar France
79018|1|Buster Keaton's final independent film is one of his finest achievements, something of a greatest hits package in its refinement of old routines.
64525|1|Despite its fleshy title, Gleize's film is a feast for the mind.
39281|0|Highlander: Endgame looks sensational, moves like lightning. But its script (by Joel Soisson) makes no pretense about being logical or even comprehensible.
48075|1|Cast against type as a corrupt cop, Denzel Washington, usually seen in noble and heroic roles, is nothing short of brilliant; with some luck, he should earn an Oscar nomination.
3776|1|Stylish, arty and quite enjoyable.
79241|1|Fritz Lang turns this into a creepily effective work, full of bravura set pieces and subtle suggestions.
54821|1|Akira Kurosawa's Red Beard is assembled with the complexity and depth of a good l9th-century novel, and it is a pleasure, in a time of stylishly fragmented films, to watch a director taking the time to fully develop his characters.
34425|1|Noirish Huston classic with great story, cast.
63684|0|The actors attack their roles with a lot of energy, and the story moves along at a brisk pace. That's a big plus, because if it ever slowed down, we'd have too much time to think about how silly it is.
70638|1|...a great diversion from, and a fine addition too, the three-peats filling up the local cinemas.
52137|1|Mr. Resnais's most successful film in years.
40519|0|Geoffrey Rush steals the show as a charismatic madman, but the story is too dated to resonate beyond its little corner of history.
80546|0|Até razoavelmente divertido em sua época, tornou-se (ainda) pior com o passar do tempo, sobrevivendo apenas como mais um dos inúmeros momentos embaraçosos da cinematografia norte-americana dos anos 80.
2361|1|I was turned on, and it really confused me.
76920|0|Amid the white walls and slick surfaces of this film, the characters seem more like lab rats than human beings.
47373|1|Good but creepy; may be too intense for some.
36115|1|Though nothing much happens this is a skilfully written comedy-drama that plays close attention to character and boasts fine performances by a quality cast.
11617|1|Tuvieron que pasar 5 años para que pudiéramos apreciar la historia original como la concibiera su creador; no obstante, prácticamente se trata de dos películas distintas.
94594|1|Though it's paced as a thriller, the film ultimately emerges as a haunting exploration of how grief can weigh on us, and the depths to which it can drive us.
39280|0|The leading contender for worst film of the year.
41297|1|Gettysburg succeeds as a motion picture event, and as a re-creation of a pivotal chapter of American history.
37125|0|Schrader's development of the frame-up story is mechanically melodramatic, and Gere, essentially a boring actor, doesn't help much either. He just cannot carry a picture, even when his passivity and gentleness well serve some aspects of his character...
100820|0|With Clone Wars, Lucas continues to plunder the past of his own imagination at a great cost: the integrity and magic of his original Star Wars trilogy.
59280|1|Glossy soaper ahead of its racially themed time.
39694|1|Despite the film being nearly 50 years old, it's still pretty impressive what they were able to accomplish using practical photography. Sure it's campy, but it's the kitschy design that makes it so much fun to watch.
5348|1|Is In the Army Now funny? Yes, Drill Sergeant, Sir! Is it stupid? Yes, sir! Does it kill brain cells? Yes, sirree!
98720|0|...silly, sentimental, sometimes cruel, often clumsy, mostly unfunny, and frustratingly inane.
46164|1|A rousing screen version of the 1983 Tony Award-winning play.
28388|1|Lest the movie get too saccharine (and it never does), Eddie Murphy is on hand to juice things up.
9059|1|2001 lingers on the mind like a tall, black riddle: Where are the new bones, the new tools, that will take us higher? Do we even deserve them?
53068|0|Bad seed? The whole dang garden is rotten in 'Joshua,' a psychological horror film that demonstrates that the poison apple doesn't fall far from the toxic family tree.
65603|0|As ever Carpenter's execution falls short of his concept.
93516|1|I did expect there to be a stronger emotional connection between Ricci and Jackson, but that said, the two actors were impressive to watch.
52922|0|The unredeemable result of Hollywood's total capitulation to the Spielberg/Lucas aesthetic of the 80s.
32078|0|This is the kind of movie in which even the sex scenes are soulless.
64980|0|What [Frei] gives us ... is a man who uses the damage of war -- far more often than the warfare itself -- to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows.
110|1|A perfect Audrey Hepburn vehicle.
96517|0|One of those parody movies that presume that merely making reference to another film constitutes a joke.
13405|1|Jerzy Kosinski's modern fable gets a terrific translation to the screen due to his tight screenplay, capable direction by Ashby, and a marvelous performance by Sellers, one unlike any other in his career.
89442|1|British director David Slade announces himself as a master of economy and discrimination by leaving the horror to the audience's imagination. This movie will make you squirm like you've never squirmed before.
42897|1|I tip my hat to the Australian filmmaker Rob Sitch for making an exciting and comical film about a subject that shouldn't be exciting or comical.
32900|0|For much of the movie, you're enthralled. By the end, you're laughing. This is not good.
15992|1|I don't what finding humor in the most unsavory of situations says about me, but in terms of LaBute, it means that a first-class filmmaker has arrived on the scene.
60887|1|The utopian ecosystem setting - dominated by lush rainforests and vast oceans - is magnificent to gawk at, and the 3D cinematography makes fine use of the prehistoric wildlife and unexplained phenomena.
45470|1|Kasdan's film lacks the spirit of Tyler's novel; he seems to be the wrong director to translate the author's affectionate and humorous treatment of the characters. Fortunately, Geena Davis as the eccentric dog-walker elevates the otherwise morose mood.
58145|0|The really sweet part comes when this really wicked avalanche does happen while they're being chased and the director decides to film the uptight skier chick in front of it, so they can use it in the commercial. It was sooooooo rad, man!
55740|1|Una obra maestra.
63889|0|Reprehensible from start to finish, and utterly manipulative and mindless to boot.
66141|1|It's always risky to proclaim a new force in film based upon just one film, but Boyz N the Hood is good enough to suggest that John Singleton is going to be a major player for a long time.
23036|1|Kids may be puzzled by rebellious worker ants chanting Marxist slogans, but their parental guides may welcome the relief from the prevailing blandness of family films.
79548|1|The settings are powerfully like real. A Senate hearing room, the Senate itself, a party home in immediate Washington and varying apartments plus a place in DC suburbia all have the look of genuineness.
82485|0|It's a typical case of the kind of movie which gets launched these days on the strength of a one-sentence pitch. Having got all dressed up, it finds that it has absolutely nowhere to go.
59142|0|Indistinguishable dumb action comedy.
96758|1|One of art's richest rewards is its way of teaching us about our assumptions, doubts, and capacity for faith. ... My Kid Could Paint That gets people thinking and talking.
57931|1|A solid slice-of-communist-life film that succeeds because it avoids the pitfalls and cliches of the typical, bittersweet coming-of-age film.
5451|1|Jurassic Park is an astonishing success in one sense and one sense only: It is the monster of all monster movies, guaranteed to challenge weak bladders, flutter heartbeats and win automatic Oscars for the [tech crew].
67911|1|Let's be clear: 'Hudson Hawk' is, by most reasonable standards, a pretty bad movie. Yet you have to give it this much: in contrast to your typical summer blockbuster, then or now, at least it's got some personality.
44446|1|This 1953 Howard Hawks film, a lightweight but agreeable adaptation of Anita Loosâ(TM)s acid novel and play, is mainly notable for cementing Marilyn Monroeâ(TM)s public image of breathy, faux-innocent sexuality.
40183|0|Not only is it an illogical, nastily violent affair full of stock characters and slasher-movie tactics, but it's a sequel to a movie that absolutely needed no sequel in the first place.
21645|0|"Imagine a chick-flick ""Quest for Fire"" that makes no sense."
66300|1|An intelligent, affectionate study of an obsessive American film director...
97126|1|Amelie meets The Pianist in I Served the King of England, one man's surreal journey through 30 years of Czech history.
65368|0|Rodriguez puts a lot of mindless violence on the screen. Moment to moment the films is unpredictable, but on the large scale the plot is old, predictable, and familiar.
44253|1|I can't ask much more of a movie from which I expected so much less.
38805|0|An attempt to blend the war epic and the caper film that doesn't quite come off.
44705|1|At once a throwback to the days of Capra and Sturges and a wholly contempo item, Snow Days is smarter and more appealing than many other recent romantic comedies.
74652|1|The end result is a film far more reminiscent of Polanski than Altman and stands as one of his most underseen but most compelling works.
39166|0|This one is strictly for the kiddies.
102397|1|It's a credit to the actor that by the end, Langella is living, it seems, in Nixon's skin.
44375|1|Quite aside from being perhaps the most elaborate prank in Jackson's career to date (or since), Forgotten Silver is a brilliant piece of moviemaking.
36380|0|Actually, Committed only teases with subtext, since it's not much of a commentary on anything.
61761|0|Turns out to be a bore with its locker-room language, its predictable celebration of the underdogs, and its thoroughly tedious subplot about the coach's custody battle.
26276|1|Thornton's brilliant performance justifies a great deal of the pap on display.
77213|0|"Loathsome doesn't begin to describe it. How about ""toxic""?"
62712|0|A slushy, sentimental, and silly love story.
78217|1|It's impossible to take your eyes off Bening when she's on the screen, not just because she's lovely but because she makes being Julia seem so darned fun.
82112|0|A facile view of the Scrabble players' world, and ... rather condescending to [its] subjects.
29719|1|Seeing [Cruise] so baby faced is the biggest surprise, but his talent was definitely visible.
50915|1|Great tale of two boys' struggle over a bicycle.
12260|1|Still sounds great, and looks as good as ever through Ray-Bans.
63178|1|A romantic comedy with just enough heart and soul to keep us flying.
18986|1|Took an opportunity to question warfare and its civility long before the war protest film became popular in the 70s. It's dated, obviously, but still powerful.
50274|1|X-rated museum piece
19011|1|...A bland but pleasing animated horse story...
78519|0|There's a big empty space where the heart of this movie should be.
15095|1|Larenz Tate, who played a homicidal in Menace II Spciety and haunted Vietnam vet in Dead Presidents, became an important transitional figure in the new black middle-class cinema, beginning this film, in which he's cast as a sophisticated and urbane man
82681|1|"Sigourney Weaver is impeccable as a distraught mother who resorts to pot to barricade her emotions in writer/director Dan Harris' diamond-sharp treatise on American family dysfunction that makes ""The Ice Storm"" look like a walk in the park."
61695|1|Truffaut faces Bradbury's abstractions head on, not as science-fiction but as humanistic fairy-tale
16933|0|Gwyneth Paltrow is engaging as the two Helens, and I have no complaints about her performance. Pity about the screenplay.
42376|1|Superb comedy, with lots of social commentary
49434|1|Like the best Tony Scott films, Spy Game simultaneously questions and celebrates outmoded codes of masculine professionalism.
24350|1|It's a tribute to veteran TV writer Greg Taylor's script and, especially, to the acting of 9-year-old Ms. Harrell that the movie remains engaging and palatably sweet.
83656|1|Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein know that now is the time to make sure people know what the Iraqi War looks like and hopefully they will.
90492|0|If your taste runs to scatology and you find little people inherently funny, Little Man may be the movie for you.
1481|0|Allen made funnier films when he thought he was Ingmar Bergman.
52202|1|The story is weak on logic, but the writing is warm and frequently laugh-out-loud funny.
69924|0|Solved: the problem of impoverished, understaffed, crime-ridden, drug- infested inner city schools. The solution: bongo music and a new Brazilian brand of martial arts that transforms incorrigible students into zealous anti-crime mercenaries.
4138|1|Sexy, funny, romantic comedy at its finest.
19233|1|Tame and too hopeful by today's standards, but Kazan's message drama was important in 1947, representing one of the first time that the word Jew was explicity used in a Hollywood picture.
39578|1|Best in Show is enjoyable and funny, light and quick.
56592|0|[Its] failure becomes most obvious in retrospect, when the realization dawns that the most affecting, inventive, and honest moments of the film were those that hewed most closely to the original text.
95861|0|The Invasion saps all the spirit out of what once was a classic alien saga.
84947|1|It's a mess, albeit a vaguely likable one.
50336|0|A relentless immersion in combat strikingly realized but none too pleasurable to sit through.
20924|0|Newsies is a live-action musical, but it's only barely alive. Call it Snoozies.
99922|0|The movie is a time-killer without a killer instinct.
18727|1|With its movie references and psycho-babble,, Baumbach's follow-up to the highly acclaimed Kicking and Screaming is imitative of Woody Allen and Stillman, a slender, one-premise serio-comedy that's better scripted and acted than helmed.
56306|0|The plotline (derived from Hamlet) soon goes flat.
4439|1|More fun than expected sci-fi, cop flick starring Jean-Claude for kicks.
78084|1|[...]The reason The Five Obstructions lingers as an essential part of von Trier's filmography [...] is because it reveals so much about why von Trier has worked the way he has in the past [...]
99541|1|Most of the footage... is at least a decade old - and the saddest commentary is that the discussion hasn't budged an inch.
58221|1|The most impressive ingredient is Cohen, whose inflection and timing are dead-on as he negotiates a vague accent, a native language composed of gibberish and a sprinkling of Polish, and a way of making tired American jokes funny again.
75833|1|An intriguing look at how the computer world got to be the way it is.
73724|1|Although this voyage into self-destruction won't be to the taste of many, there will be few unmoved by Finney's towering performance as the tragic Britisher.
51048|0|There is so much wrong with Slackers, it may be more efficient simply to point out the one acceptable ingredient: Jason Schwartzman.
40950|1|In uniting to honor Arenas, Bardem and Schnabel create something extraordinary.
38734|1|I hope a few more scripts for these old geezers are in the offing. Like the Lemmon-Matthau films, this one is just plain fun.
7856|1|A hilarious black comedy that proved too dark and too smart for its star's fan base.
16640|1|*Violent and blaring ... a vibrant bit of tabloid trash infotainment, a guilty pleasure for those with a taste for bittersweet candy.
11138|1|This is art.
84831|0|You may actually think it's going somewhere at the time. But ultimately, you realize it's only going through the motions.
96593|0|Belying the claim there's no longer any truth in advertising, The Final Season is exactly the formulaic, by-the-numbers movie it appears to be. These Tigers deserved better.
52669|0|There's one saving grace: Reynolds may look a lot like NL's Chevy Chase, but, hey, he's actually quite likeable.
49581|1|You have to like a movie that, in its rosy denouement, proclaims giddily, 'It's a great day for Flemish showbiz!'
38148|1|Despite a denouement which arrives half an hour too late, the complexities of James' work are superbly realised.
54127|0|Vaughan brings such disregard to the film that its pedestrian on-court action might as well have been shot from the bleacher seats.
90201|0|The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is an uninspired, unoriginal entry in what was already an unoriginal franchise. It's fun to look at, but its narcissistic message is unappealing in the extreme.
65892|0|You won't learn anything about Italian culture that hasn't already reverberated throughout the west
46307|0|Casualties of War is dull.
70280|0|Fitzgerald's unfinished novel transfers awkwardly to the screen but is saved from oblivion by that always-fascinating actor De Niro.
84773|0|The austere, cerebral 'Dominion' is a serious and ambitious alternative to Harlin's movie, but it's only marginally superior to it.
67729|1|Time might not have been kind to the look of WarGames, but with nuclear war still a very real threat, the picture's ability to manufacture suspense remains undimmed.
98484|0|You find yourself wishing that what happened in Edinburgh stayed in Edinburgh.
47406|0|The movie's presumption of ignorance on the audience's part is monumental.
33126|0|Finds no cinematic equivalent for Thompson's outrageous language; the material seems strangely meek.
84060|1|An underrated cracker.
80593|1|Reasonably chilling.
86170|1|In its own sneaky way, the film cleverly manages to examine the meaning of loneliness while looking at dysfunctional-family dynamics, but without becoming too overwhelming or too heavy-handed.
19347|1|If you're collecting Best Pictures, 'In the Heat of the Night' was completely deserving of the Oscar then, and remains a taut crime drama almost 50 years later.
40316|1|This is a terrific holiday film.
3545|0|The main problem with Stargate is not with set-up, but with execution. After a while you feel like you're just watching weird people staggering around a desert.
30009|1|One of the great films noirs, softened just a little by the moralising censorship strictures of the time. See it.
26303|0|The first big-screen resurrection aimed squarely at a generation that probably never heard of, much less watched, the original TV show.
52318|1|By the time the movie is through ... you realize that the simplicity of the story and its characters have taken root in your mental landscape and will assume a lingering presence.
83269|1|Until it careers into cacophony ... it's a lot of fun.
82507|0|At times Tracy's a sensitive guy who just needs a hug; at others, he's an obnoxious motormouth.
92024|0|Actually serves as little else but agitprop for South Africa's ruling party . . .
15650|0|Speed 2's a test of patience.
41688|1|There are scares aplenty in Dawn of the Dead; enjoy them and be well. Twenty years from now, though, I know which version I'll still be watching.
53566|1|...a thoroughly average piece of work...
49106|0|A blatant tearjerker with the kind of shady characterization and plot development that give the genre a bad reputation.
80866|0|Mr. Nanny is of little interest to any audience other than pre-teens.
54816|1|Jaunty.
36254|1|Given the short shelf life of many rude 'n' crude Hollywood comedies, it's amazing how well Caddyshack stands up after all these years.
30601|0|Moore is merely the best-oiled cog in this perpetual motion machine.
65303|0|Its noble intentions are undermined by syrupy, movie-of- the-week direction.
98440|1|Like a kid let loose in a toy store, this bad boy horny guru could have used more direction, but he does impress with his driving skills atop a pachyderm, during elephant sex.
75575|1|... Hodges is the kind of director who can breathe new life into old material with an offhand, deceptively minimalist approach.
86144|1|This is a film with a wide range of emotions. It is a film with some laughter and some very affecting moments. It may be a flawed film, but parts are really excellent.
56602|0|Tenta desesperadamente ser um novo Jogo, Trapaças e Dois Canos Fumegantes, mas perde o jogo, trapaceia o espectador e é este quem entra pelo cano.
87876|0|"Shapeless and redundant, this flick is exactly the sort of movie you'd envision if I said ""mildly retarded yet physically gorgeous young romance."""
10484|0|The plot, as it eventually unfolds, is so absurd and leads to such a silly climax that much of the audience's good will is burned away.
82052|1|Captures hope and compassion in a shady part of humanity most probably unaccustomed to such things.
36845|1|It's mainly through the efforts of the superior ensemble cast that the family drama turns out to be better than average.
85625|1|Serenity pulls off more honestly thrilling action with a fraction of Lucas' average budget.
56089|0|A lightweight, uneven action comedy that freely mingles French, Japanese and Hollywood cultures.
25212|1|Occasionally crude and tasteless, Ruthless People is a comedy with a vitriolic twist. It`s a comedy about people who love to hate, with actors who make it worth seeing.
43444|0|As corny as a tankful of gasohol.
41398|1|Performances of delicacy make this worth watching.
4537|1|Well acted, but bleak and slow-moving.
5918|0|aufman's heavy-handedness and a half-baked script with unfocused performances to match render this unentertaining, vacuous nonsense.

95063|1|The TV Set is a little wonder of a movie, as smart and sad and true as any comedy I've seen this year.
3871|1|Muriel's Wedding isn't a perfect comedy, tragedy, or drama, but it contains enough original elements of each to make it worth a look.
24293|1|As epic, emotionally satisfying spectacle, it's way up there with the very best in mainstream animation.
431|0|Standard coming of age story, the adult gimmick doesn't add anything.
85050|0|[B]ottled-up angst somehow isn't as attractive when it's not pining away by the canals of Venice in the 19th century but rather over the... skyline of 21st-century New York...
101123|1|Trouble the Water employs Kim Roberts' startling camcorder footage to reveal how little New Orleans prepared its citizens for the coming disaster.
97876|0|About as funny as watching a cute animal die a long slow death - and probably as painful.
26199|1|Noe deserves credit for a cinematic vision which is remarkably his own.
61594|1|Young viewers and old alike will be given powerful metaphors of servanthood and selflessness, humility and honor, courage and Christ-like kindness.
20484|1|Technically, it may be the best-made war movie yet, but dramatically, it barely delivers.
76035|1|A marvelous example of Keaton's ability to mine laughs from an essentially serious situation (blood feuds and assassination attempts) while at the same time spoofing the melodramatic pretensions of the genre (Southern customs, codes of honor, etc).
65328|1|You haven't seen this many outrageous costumes since the Halloween parade on Cedar Springs.
28742|1|Roland Emmerich's best film, and Lundgren's best acting job. Admittedly that ain't saying much in either case, but a fun flick all in all.
18941|0|Both story and style reveal the calculations of an artist so desperate to get noticed that he forgot to cover his id.
38608|1|A rare film, which makes a powerful political statement while telling a touching personal story. In his feature debut, Puenzo shows commitment to human rights without imposing explicit political doctrine.
40634|1|A great adventure, a lush romance, and a good movie.
65818|1|Entertaining documentary that subtly delivers an important message, while making some astute observations about American foreign policy.

91297|1|If the world is going to hell in any number of handbaskets -- as Judge so acutely demonstrates that it is -- you might as well hitch a ride in his.
20895|0|Steven Brill, who has a small role in the film, constructed the screenplay much as one would put together some of those particleboard bookcases from Ikea.
15201|0|The line 'This is not an American story, it's an Irish one' means nothing ... it is a story as American as McNuggets -- all extra-crispy coating and no real meat underneath.
39271|1|There might have been a better, more involving method of telling Hoffman's story, but it is expressed with a firm sense of commitment to accuracy and authenticity.
21858|1|While I wouldn't say it revolutionizes the chick flick, it's certainly more clever and endurable than most of them.
3667|0|Enormous energy went into this movie. I could not, however, care about it for much more than a moment at a time, and after awhile its manic energy wore me down.
101529|1|Most noteworthy for Anne Hathaway's absorbing, Oscar-nominated portrayal of a disturbed soul desperate to control the demons derailing her reality.

86885|1|The central message is that people who want to hate will embrace anything that supports their beliefs.
96971|1|Fred Claus will never go down in history as a holiday classic, or even one of Vaughn's better known films, but a sterling cast lifts up what could have been easy mediocrity.
94153|1|Enjoyable, well made family drama with strong performances, an engaging plot, impressive action sequences and a decent script.
1079|0|"Gimmicky film that takes some great actors and makes them into props. Depp plays against type, and Walken manages okay as the film operates in real time (a device used many times before and since, most recently in Fox's ""24"" TV show). Skip it."

6671|0|The angst of dating, the struggle with children, and the joys of McDonalds.
3145|1|The genius of all this beauty is that it truly is chillingly scary.
19560|1|While everyone remembers this film about an autistic man as Dustin Hoffman's Oscar-winning triumph, it is equally Tom Cruise's.
20807|1|Morbidly fascinating work, choreographed from within a vacuum devoid of feeling and retribution, and spearheaded by a director who must find some sadistic pleasure in being such an exacting provocateur.
11093|1|The fact it was the fifth most lucrative film in its year of release is a depressing sign of how we have infantilized ourselves as spectators. [Full review in Portuguese.]
12619|1|One of the true classics of splatterdom. Sickeningly wonderful.
77966|1|Scary, puzzling, and different.
29419|0|Seems forced, calculating, self-conscious.
10892|1|Reservoir Dogs is hideously ugly in its materials, but in the sure way it's made and the vividness of the performances, it's a thing of beauty.

98670|1|I never would have guessed that Adam Carolla, the politically incorrect radio and TV personality, could hold his own in a movie, but here's The Hammer to prove me wrong.
22464|1|It's too bad with all of the poker action there wasn't enough time to establish the relationships between characters.
62436|1|Gary Gray's version is tauter, better made but insufficiently idiosyncratic to attract a cult following.
40697|0|The result is a film that is not so much bad as mechanical and uptight.
45691|1|One of Murphy's better outings, which admittedly isn't saying much.
98429|0|It's a rare film that makes a reviewer consider giving up the movies altogether. My own Waterloo came forty-five minutes into The Love Guru when I briefly considered stabbing out my own eyes so that I wouldn't have to watch it any more.
12437|1|Unjustly labeled a failure after its disappointing box office run, The Right Stuff's tarnished reputation can only benefit from Warner's sparkling new 2-disc special edition.
14215|1|Murphy directs cleanly, arranging the shoot-outs and Billy's personal declarations of doubt with a solid rhythm, making the film feel urged instead of assigned.
86431|0|Although the film starts off somewhat amusingly, the first-time feature director Katrina Holden Bronson seems to have spent more energy assembling the overbearing soundtrack than expanding on her characters' fractured relationships.
80079|1|Sit back and enjoy the Matthau.
45745|0|A disastrous attempt at blending comedy and horror.
92315|1|Overly forced, a shade too whimsical, but filling a void other words and other movies haven't the nerve or errant taste to confront.
16180|0|The two actors create vivid characters, but they're so unsympathetic and Van Sant drags them through so many tiresome, pretentious scenes that it begins to look as if Phoenix's narcolepsy isn't part of the plot.
24912|1|Watson's performance is virtuoso: passionate, sensitive, impressionable and sometimes grotesque; and she's well matched by the subtle Griffiths and vibrant Morrisey.
14702|0|Anyone seeking a fresh characterization of clever plot twist ought not to buy a ride of this Murphy vehicle.
34282|1|A film considered essential by many filmmakers who clearly inspired in it to compose their horror symphonies, with a delusional premise and daring situations. [Full review in Spanish]
37980|1|For all Potemkin's rabble-rousing propaganda, Eisenstein's aestheticism is everywhere apparent.
49556|1|It's one of the better 'women pictures,' though it got too weepie, mushy and full of itself for me.
43843|0|Loach and screenwriter Paul Laverty draw everything in simplistic, overstated terms.
20772|1|Sumptuous, haunting, and unusually tender... a nakedly psychological 'in' to [Bergman's] earliest artistic impulses; nothing else in his oeuvre addresses so directly his childhood escapes into fantasy as the by-product of a harsh Lutheran upbringing.
74336|1|Michael Caine is perfect.
8015|1|If the film doesn't add up to a cogent legal argument, neither does it have trouble delivering 2 hours and 20 minutes' worth of sturdy, highly charged drama.
53242|1|It's all rather sprawling and a bit disjointed, but Scorsese's vigorous pacing and eye for detail hold it all together and provide a vivid setting for DiCaprio's masterful performance (his best work yet).
64377|1|Leonard Kastle brings a spare dignity and genuine depth of characterization to his exploitation subject.
37777|1|There's plenty to be impressed by while watching this 1992 noirish thriller, cowritten by Tom Epperson and directed by Carl Franklin, but not a great deal of aftertaste.
15129|1|This tough-to-peg whodunit keeps you going for two hours, despite a few James Bond-ish (or Jane Bond-ish) turns that play less preposterously than you might assume were they to be divulged.
29957|1|Not remotely a defense of junk, but it does respect comedy as a force for escapism.
94996|0|Watching it was a very cold experience.
892|1|Mostly useless
8168|1|As is often the case, the scumbags are far more interesting than the good guys.
22274|1|Pitt and Jolie have chemistry to burn, and the film hits more often than it misses.
50717|0|Oedekerk's latest exercise in what I like to call 'the cinema of screechy hellsuck.'

32666|1|The real star of the show is Lange.
101893|1|Role Models is a film for the nerds, by the nerds. Lucky for Role Models, the rest of our culture is catching up and are invited along as well.
95170|0|It's a bit short of laughs, but there are a few cute ideas in this formulaic, predictable romantic comedy.
81890|1|Wood is content to pace his film with a methodic leisure that both suits his tone and stretches his story a bit thin.
39992|0|A few solid punch lines get lost amid the stupidity.
94862|0|The film lags badly in the middle; the flashbacks to Ben's childhood aren't especially interesting and the lengthy soccer sequence is sheer dead weight.
67590|0|"To paraphrase one of my favorite lines from one of my favorite films (""Little Big Man""): Sometimes the Magic Kingdom works, and sometimes it doesn't."
85477|1|A better than average western in the Clint Eastwood tradition
53105|0|With no real redemption at the end of the road, it is nothing more than a beautiful, empty journey.
80342|0|Guys will have a few laughs but this certainly won't have the rewatch value of the likes of Old School or the Pie movies.
39491|1|One wonders why Hackman needed to wait for a score of years to get this film produced given its mastery of the techniques of detective thrillers.
39754|1|The underwater sequences were excellently shot by Havens, and the make-up for the half man, half fish was a masterful creation by Bud Westmore and Jack Keven.
81144|0|See this film for its story and for Malkovich' performance, or if you are easily distracted and irritated, buy the book and imagine everything yourself instead.
95233|1|Performances are more mature, the soundtrack (by Nicholas Hooper) less grandiose, and Yates executes some thrilling set-pieces.
13739|1|A riveting, funny, and suspenseful horror classic.
73947|1|A fine feature in the Val Lewton series for RKO is not so much a horror film, though it does contain one of Karloff's more deliciously sadistic performances.
99152|1|Outpost is exactly what a horror film should be - while also commenting on a whole history of human barbarity and conflict that seems doomed forever to repeat itself.
101306|0|On the whole, a film one can live without.
19422|1|This triple-Oscar-winning boxing drama is shot through with genuine impassioned commitment, born of the fact that Sylvester Stallone realised that this was his best hope of stardom.
35289|1|A touching, sentimental little piece of fluff.
56279|0|Is this Ernest 17 or 18? Matters not, since they are all Jim Varney the same.
48297|1|Significantly (and surprisingly) the nasty tone of Hellman's morality drama about corruption and greed in a Southern clan remained intact, allowing Bette Davis (in a role that Bankhead originated on stage) to shine as the amoral and immoral matriarch
82528|0|The current NRA spokesman Heston is just right for such a controversial part, and gives the western some firepower.
92768|1|Steven Soderbergh massages his fond memories of the golden (if sometimes black and white) days of movies with a noirish sensibility.
17511|1|A good, old-fashioned romantic comedy.
3835|0|The movie seems better suited to a holiday release. While You Were Sleeping arrives at the peak of spring, the only season that can make Christmas seem like an unwelcome visitor.
73240|0|Billy Bob phones in a below-par performance but still blows his young rival off the screen.
70887|0|Robot Stories has the look and feel of an above-average student film, but Pak's potential promises better things to come.
94707|0|Computer-animated ugliness
4372|0|Unendurable.
60822|1|Director James Hill tackles the material in a manner that relies more on naturalistic behavior than cheap theatrics (i.e. no scenes of Elsa covering her eyes with her paws after a human does something imbecilic).
5368|1|Director Wolfgang Petersen moves the story along, but his real job is to simply stay out of the way of his two racehorse lead actors. And he does.
101342|0|This is nobody's idea of an intelligent political thriller (or satire), but it is an orgy for the senses.
17178|1|Spacey, the best reason to see Midnight, gives his usual suave, effortless performance.
20942|0|A gloomy holiday tale that fails to enchant.
32216|0|Willfully superficial.
81297|1|The movie is slight but in a way that makes it the opposite of pushy; it's companionably easy to laugh with.
59373|0|It goes without saying that no one will disagree with the movie's politics, but the movie itself -- the artistry and storytelling -- are as flimsy and clumsy as you can get.
33654|1|Sure it falls apart right at the end--but up until that point it's a gem of an underrated comedy.
73311|1|This is a pretty spiffing adventure yarn, with some classically staged fights, terrific performances.
40638|1|Despite its flaws, this is a film that looks great, includes a memorable Hopkins performance, and is well enough written to keep us thinking rather than latching onto stereotypes.
40287|0|Bypasses the ambition and integrity found in a similar-themed but markedly better film like Norman Jewison's The Hurricane.
52743|1|One of the funniest sports movies ever.
50593|1|A welcome return to the classy thrillers of yesteryear
4660|1|Federal Hill is lively and likable, a first film with the kind of swift action, clever dialogue and clear-cut characters that suggest an expert director's touch.
4889|0|It's the moralistic tenor of A Bronx Tale that's ultimately most off-putting.
28048|1|This breezy yet complicated look at maybe the most famous menage a trois modern history has known is Trauffaut's finest moment.
60298|0|Manages to offend the same people it seeks to defend with the most ridiculous and nonsensical endings that I've ever seen.
7736|1|Horrific? Not really. But interesting to watch.
93979|1|It is about love, family, and the power of kindness to overcome the cruelty in the world.
91076|1|"Never idle, and always wild, ""Idlewild"" truly is an adults-only musical about gangsters."
6004|1|Anspaugh, whose Hoosiers showed he knows from feel-good movies, directs this story as if he were conducting Bolero, carefully building climax upon climax as the story spirals to an underdog triumph every bit as tearful as that of Rocky.
99508|0|For all its transient black-and-white beauties, denies its subject the sort of solid context that would reveal the scale of her achievements. A patchy, frustrating, though loving tribute.
39552|1|A visionary and magical experience. This film is miraculous.
18057|1|Wonderful story with some mature material.
62986|1|Fabulously entertaining.
5240|1|Twohy's script dares and succeeds in peppering the dialogue with funny insider references to Hollywood scripts and actors.
14361|1|Smartly written and boasting a sensational cast, Cameron Crowe's shrewdly observed third feature also gives Tom Cruise one of his very best roles...
38300|1|Croupier also offers an intriguing look at the writing process and the allure of writing, which in part is the ability to pull strings.
101082|0|This occasionally lavish, often clunky venture is consistently watchable if not terribly memorable or distinctive.
84677|0|It's all distressing, superficial and caveman-like in its amour fou.
15711|0|The draggy narrative of this 1997 comedy is tough to sit through -- there are even several overproduced musical numbers -- but it does have an intriguing subversive element that I don't want to give away.
44704|0|Think of an infantile, babblegabbing Shaft without any real cool.
92005|0|No one will ever be able to accuse series creators and scribes Leigh Wannell and James Wan of being stingy with the red stuff.
21465|1|Explores some playful male adolescent fantasies.

76791|1|The acting is (pardon the pun) wooden.
20967|0|The plotting of this 1980 feature -- outsider in a hostile environment -- is personal to Altman, though few of the feelings survive the clutter.
92838|0|Code Name: The Cleaner is one of the year's big stinkers.
12901|1|Stanley Kubrick's film is a work of art that will continue to be broken down and explored for decades to come...
37779|1|Hard-boiled modern-day film noir that explodes on the screen with great force.
58741|1|One of the more intelligent children's movies to hit theaters this year.
57523|1|The overall fabric is hypnotic, and Mr. Mattei fosters moments of spontaneous intimacy.
15027|1|It's tempting to think Pacino stopped trying sometime in the mid-1980s. But watch Lefty's elegiac final scene and you might conclude that it's not Al's ability that's dimmed, rather it's the imagination of casting directors that's grown stale.
30193|0|Whatever steam Culkin gained in Home Alone was lost in this tepid sequel rehash.
13907|1|Christian Forte's script is top-notch.
67779|1|A wondrously composed cathedral of light and shadow that departs from one text to establish another, parallel cosmos based on the architecture of the human face.
86857|0|The dramatic tension is nil. But the performances, particularly by Hunt (in a non-comedic role, for a change), are worth a look.
1234|1|At the end of the day, it's exactly what most spectators would really love to see on the fairway.
18119|1|Solid period piece with good dialogue. Standard relationship stuff, but well done.
24847|1|Shows that every family has a potential for resiliency and growth, no matter what the problems.
13950|1|This film is going to have lots of return viewers and will be one of the more successful of the franchise.
8372|1|A defining film in the history of cinema, The Godfather introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits.
58305|0|Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel you can refuse.
89505|0|Visually arresting but only sporadically enthralling.
21442|1|Seemed fun at the time, in '87, but dates badly. Still, kids might like it.
62991|1|Although it's enjoyable as a bittersweet, fish-out-of-water love story, Sidney Lumet's A Stranger Among Us is less effective when it transforms itself into an exotic whodunit.
25996|1|Brings just enough of a twist to the series' conventions.
30874|1|They Shoot Horses, Don't They? epitomizes the human condition of its own era, only this time the faces aren't romantic heroes on the front line but vulgar, desperate washouts.
77419|0|Something bewildering has happened in Richard Brooks's making of it, and it misses at being either Conrad or sheer entertainment cinema.
55505|1|Jason Statham uses his smoldering charisma to great effect.

72018|0|The filmgoing experience is just short of torture.
13310|1|After Columbine, this dark comedy isn't as funny.
381|0|Since the fights are all digitally conjured up anyway, genuine thrills are at a minimum and the copious sprays of pixelated blood quickly pall.
6448|0|Another useless addition to a jam-packed genre
67376|1|This is cloying, deceitful, and more or less irresistible.
65187|0|The elements never quite come together, and the main characters never quite spring to life.
6538|1|A pop epiphany, marking that commercially creative point where the power of Hollywood meets the purity of myth.
17890|1|Primary Colors successfully straddles the line between comedy and tragedy.
36100|0|Exhibits little passion and even less mind.
69100|1|Of Adam's Rib we might say...that it isn't solid food but it certainly is meaty and juicy and comically nourishing.
20916|1|Fun, but seems to be missing a magical tone that'd you'd hope for when combining the Muppets and Dickens.
69639|1|A film about the dance world that really reaches out to everyone.
7661|0|Striptease is not a disaster like that other expensive ecdysiast extravaganza, Showgirls, though if it were, it might at least have some redeeming camp awfulness to enliven its otherwise dull mediocrity.
71339|1|These fragile, self-destructive people, practically in spite of themselves, manage to charm their way into our hearts.
99246|0|Klimt comes across as a lovely but unfathomable object, and an inadvertent case study in the argument for the ultimate integrity of Klimt's art.
4946|1|"""Carlito's Way,"" like ""Scarface,"" is first and last a character study, a portrait of a man who wants to be better than he is."

22843|1|'Vegas needs a new king.' That, right there, is all you need to know plotwise of this ridiculously fun no-budget actioner.
12199|1|Akira Kurosawa's Samurai take on King Lear is brutal but brilliant, a startling transposition to match his earlier Macbeth adap Throne Of Blood.
81796|0|While MacLachlan captures Grant's regal confidence, his overenunciation and hammy gestures lean more into caricature than imitation.
30113|1|The narrative is plodding, time has not been kind to set-pieces that were once so thrilling and now seem oddly perfunctory, and 007's misogyny and casual slapping of several women is more than faintly repellent.
95801|0|Resembles Team America: World Police. It has better-looking puppets (but) suffers the same amount of string pulling.
3672|1|It may not be a classic or even as successful as the genuinely unsettling 1972 E.C. Comics adaptation, but now, just as in 1995, it fulfills its goal as a sardonic, blessedly unpretentious creature feature.
47536|1|Innocence is full of charm and strangeness -- and a sense that childhood is a place of incredible terrors and fleeting joys, of rapt innocence and fatal experience.
14989|1|What Lost Highway lacks in originality--compared to the rest of Lynch's oeuvre--it regains when compared to anyone else's films.

9539|1|A genuine American classic.
94302|1|It's not too hard to imagine that the inspiration for this show came during a late night, cannabis fueled attack of the munchies. It's no masterpiece but that's the idea.

23504|1|Make no mistake: Style is paramount in Belly, a flashy, trashy look at the gangsta' life, which Hype Williams has exploited in videos for Puff Daddy, Mase, Tupac Shakur...
68623|1|It was Hawks' genius to recognize a kinship between his leads, and to understand that the 'naturalism' of the Wayne persona was as deep and complex as the more intellectualized approach of the neurotic young New York stage actor, Clift.

81032|1|A welcome antidote to anodyne Hollywood cartooning.

97520|1|It's a biblical parable about America's failure to square religion and greed. But most of all it is a marvellously entertaining soap: a sort Dickens does Dallas, without the sex or swimming pools.
87421|1|Reese Witherspoon is a marvel.
15261|0|Cast of newcomers is appealing, but this small-town melodrama is so old-fashioned and out-of-touch with contemporary youth that it feels as if it were made the same time that its story is set, in 1957.

2570|1|A touching tale of friendship lost and found
4301|0|Rudolph's effort to dramatize the life of the acerbic writer is dissatisfying due to shallow script that offers only a sketchy look, and Jennfer Jason Leigh's stiff rendition further hampered by arch accent; it's all black-and-white style and no drama.

49967|1|Tautou is a remarkable young actress. Her wide-eyed, gamine look, reminiscent of a young Audrey Hepburn or Leslie Caron, gives Amelie an innocence and vulnerability that is so essential to make the story work.

81024|1|Blood sprays, limbs fall, bodies are chopped in half -- business as usual in this moderately diverting feudal Japanese revenge story, enlivened by peculiar plot twists and offbeat cinematic flourishes that greatly influenced Quentin Tarantino.
28745|0|Though the idea is dumb enough to be fun, director Roland Emmerich does the Terminator thing without much style, and the two stars bash into each other but never connect.

32151|0|Reduced to pure plot, the narrative is not so much a sendup of 1980s hypocrisy as an orgy of banal, juvenile mean-spiritedness. The irony of Wolfe's book becomes shrill, screaming sarcasm, unpleasant, and, worse, unfunny.
92564|0|The idea of growth as metaphor truly runs wild in Fur, until the thicketry of meaning and subtext becomes more dense than meaningful, and your attention is stopped, finally, at the surface of Nicole Kidman's placid full moon of a face.

34365|1|Rather than a vapid national epic, it is a warm, droll, deftly cracked romantic comedy.
41856|0|It's pretty bad, but not as bad as its legend.
51967|0|...Soderbergh has essentially gone full circle and made his artiest flick yet. Trouble is, it's just not terribly interesting.
66822|0|Humor that takes as its apparent premise the assumption that all women are catty, sexually voracious, weight-obsessed whores ... is more than anyone in this day and age, even in the context of a cartoonish farce, should be expected to take.
13|1|The 3-D viewing doesn't make much difference...but it is a joy to see these superb films back on the big screen, even after dozens of DVD viewings.
54497|0|The slick production values impress and Barbara Carrera and Klaus Maria Brandauer are good value villains, but Irvin Kershner appears to have nodded off in the director's chair.
61345|1|Phone Booth is a much better movie than it has any right to be, given its absurd premise...
55555|1|The script is witty and touching, and the performances of the leads (and most of the supporting players) carry it off perfectly.
86020|0|If you like cold, dark, claustrophobic spaces, I highly recommend you go rediscover The Abyss. If that doesn't work, just go hole yourself up in a closet!
59048|1|Franco is an excellent choice for the walled-off but combustible hustler, but he does not give the transcendent performance SONNY needs to overcome gaps in character development and story logic.
8494|0|Joe Pesci and Danny Glover need to get their agents on the phone, pronto.
31942|0|While the performances are flawless, Michael Seitzman's screenplay is embarrassingly sophomoric, so much so that the film's denouement completely obliterates its feminist message.
14984|1|Surprisingly funny bickering couple movie.
88954|1|This 1953 film has Janet Leigh in jeans, beautiful location shooting (and Technicolor cinematography) in the Rockies, and some of the most intense psychological warfare to be found in [director Anthony] Mann's angular and anguished oeuvre.
89425|1|A film with more chuckles then guffaws, hopefully the producers will settle on better movies to make fun of next time around.
89603|0|Comes unglued about two thirds of the way through
82812|0|I can't remember the last time I gave a movie an extra half star because the animal lead is so cute.
62018|0|Blue Car boasts great talent in Bruckner, Straithairn and Moncrieff... [but] that talent isn't enough to get over the obstacles in the movie's second half.

8516|1|Constructed without a traditional denouement, Girls Town will nevertheless satisfy viewers who want something that feels more like life than like art.
97233|0|A medical thriller with a noggin full of novocaine, this shocker about a botched heart surgery evidently suffered brain surgery to match.
2419|0|Were it not for John Travolta's big-hearted portrayal of an unemployed white factory worker driven to commit a desperate act, the movie would be an emotionally frozen exercise in cautious high-mindedness.
46824|0|...director William Lustig tries his best to infuse the movie with a decent amount of style.
81114|0|A rather stiff soap opera romantic-melodrama.
36696|1|Another humdinger of a musical.
65997|1|A powerful, intelligently-assembled documentary from American director Stephanie Black, which explores the devastating impact of globalisation upon the Caribbean island of Jamaica.
99966|1|There are too many unanswered questions and a suspicious forced happy ending, but Surfwise is still a fascinatingly voyeuristic and emotionally powerful movie.
39952|0|When Altman's ensemble pieces click the effect is invigorating. When they fail we're left with nothing to do but star-gaze. Gere, Fawcett, Hunt and company turn out to be beautiful ornaments on a dry, bland Texas sheet cake.
41140|1|An unblinking chronicle of the world on the eve of destruction.
61456|1|Scripted like a series of bouts between goofy contenders, and teeming with narrative sucker-punches and wacky left-field cameos.
87348|1|"Despite the obvious influences of the original ""Chainsaw,"" ""Hills Have Eyes,"" ""Last House,"" and other kidnap-terror films, you can't predict what is going to happen in this film."
42514|1|Still powerful expose of evangelism.
59819|0|The sort of nerve required to produce an excellent screenplay like Chinatown seems to have deserted Towne in this, his directorial debut.
96497|0|Adds nothing new or fresh to our understanding of how individuals cope with the sudden and tragic death of a loved one.
65254|0|Like a Mike Leigh film on steroids, situations don't dawn slowly on these characters, they come crashing down on their heads.
86788|0|Awash with sentimentality, this meandering tale falls way short of Crowe's usual standards.
55355|1|Pioneering... extravagant.
56759|1|Very simply the gentlest and most touching war-related film I've ever seen.
96975|0|Rather than creating imaginative situations for Vaughn to explore, director David Dobkin merely asks that Vaughn be himself, as if his personality were big enough to wring humor out of a comic vacuum.
77656|0|La frustración proviene de ver un pésimo abordaje de lo que originalmente fue una buena idea que contaba además con una estupenda actriz.

45930|0|The characters are not well-developed.
31437|0|The Japanese sneak attack that plunged the US into WW II is lavishly and fairly accurately, if not enthrallingly, brought to the screen.
39111|1|Wyoming's scenic splendors against which the story is filmed are breathtaking. Sunlight, the shadow of rain storms and the eerie lights of night play a realistic part in making the picture a visual treat.
82009|1|It's not the sort of film that will make you like its subjects, but you will understand them and appreciate their power.
75506|1|"Browning's sympathies are clear; if there are ""freaks"" on display here, they are not the versatile performers to whom the title seems to allude."
43231|0|Sally forth, gentle viewer, and enjoy yourself. En route, you will experience a steady supply of doo-doo jokes, dispensed in seven-minute intervals by the Script-O-Tron 3000TM.
54803|1|The script is loaded with holes and the direction is tired, but the film is still one of the better Bond spoofs.
61390|1|One of the funnier and, in an odd way, disturbing stand-up concert films in a long while.
58268|0|I spit on this garbage. Two kids with a camcorder in a garage could do better.
66107|1|A sloppy but lovable pooch of a movie.
45928|1|"There is nothing about either the story or its execution to place ""The Land Before Time"" alongside the classics, but then again, the age of animated masterpieces may be forever past."
68841|1|An impeccably faithful, beautifully played and occasionally languorous adaptation of E.M. Forster's classic novel.
28754|0|A one-dimensional comedy that mostly falls flat.
78882|1|Wonderful romantic mystery, sure to haunt your memory
67058|0|The concept is clever, but the film's parts don't fit well and the main character is one of the least likable you'll find.

59341|1|Amusing and clever

41993|0|Self-indulgent and boring; mature teens only.
34389|1|It's an insane circus and you know that something, or someone, is going to blow a gasket. Pacino's performance is a multilayered display and the whole picture seems infected by his jitters.
96321|0|Feast of Love is a multi-layered -- layers of baloney -- tale of pursuit of love.
51153|1|It's crafty, energetic and smart -- the kid is sort of like a fourteen-year old Ferris Bueller.
40106|0|Daldry can piece together a competent montage sequence, but he has no idea how to hold your attention without resorting to inspid, watery melodrama.
7926|1|The best of the 1990s disaster-flick revivals, and certainly a solid effort by the usual standards of its star (Stallone) and its hack director (Rob Cohen).

12821|1|Humphrey Bogart gives one of his best performances in John Huston's chronicle of greed and crime, for which Walter Huston (John's son) won the Supporting Oscar; years later Jonn's daughter won the Oscar.
24727|1|Kenneth Branagh and Helena Bonham Carter generate enough good will to keep aloft a charming bit of whimsy that probably would crash and burn with lesser talents at the controls.
12198|1|A film for the ages.
12112|1|Wings of Desire is one of Wenders's most stunning achievements.
21536|1|A wonderfully invented world full of characters that transcend their puppet limitations thanks to the energy and creativity of the Jim Hansen and Frank Oz team of puppeteers and voice actors
31056|1|Truly, the movie doesn't gain a lot from being set to music; after about half an hour it starts to feel like a gimmick.
79667|1|... arguably the most aggressively defiant film of his career.
73964|1|You always know that you're being manipulated by Pure Country, and you're usually pretty sure what's going to happen next. Still, chances are fairly good you'll leave the theater smiling when it's over, humming one of the sentimental songs.
83488|1|Kung Fu Hustle flies by on bursts of dizzying slapstick invention. There's rarely a dull moment, but the wise-guy tone and the non-stop frenzy wear you down.
24606|1|Observe, and offer cod psychological analysis to your friends.
16330|0|The story is just an empty, manipulative compilation of tragedies and misunderstandings.
95850|1|As ridiculous as The Invasion gets, its competent acting, fast pace, and campy B-movie vibe keep you weirdly transfixed against your better judgment.
81845|1|A very effective tale of morals, conscience, and peer pressure.
88890|1|There's a pleasingly Hitchcockian feel to this entertainingly old-fashioned thriller and writer-director Craig Rosenberg pulls off several impressive twists so that you're never quite sure just where the story's going.
94769|0|Despite some gratuitous allusions to Gitmo, the third-rate effects and the two-bit characters make this a summer wipeout.
98339|0|Ready to rumble, scantily clad Neanderthals gone wild, gliding around the globe faster than high speed Internet. And while dodging seemingly nearsighted menacing reptiles with bad manners, whose oversized choppers repeatedly miss their mark.
85941|1|While not particularly original, Red Eye is immensely entertaining and a fine example of the classic suspense-thriller.
19387|1|I cannot recall a more marvelous pair of acting performances in any one film.
84263|0|Effortlessly living up to its title, Rhinestone is as artificial and synthetic a concoction as has ever made its way to the screen.
78098|0|A vain and vapid intellectual exercise that only serves to illustrate Lars von Trier's unswerving arrogance.
64615|1|It's a treasure, smartly written, delightfully played (you'll be able to see why Cusack quickly became a star), and scored with a half-dozen period hits...
20797|1|"Little gem of a film complements Duvall's later film ""The Apostle"""
73725|1|Not for the purists, maybe, but the last half-hour, as Firmin plunges ever deeper into his self-created hell, leaves one shell-shocked.
54357|1|A fantasy fable that should keep everyone in the family entertained.
9761|1|Delicious adult fare sure to leave you hungry.
80694|1|Effective TV adaptation of King's novel
92657|1|The script won't win any stars for originality, it's all put across with enough sincerity to make the corn easy to swallow.
88215|0|Absolutely dreadful and offensive comedy.
78102|1|Reveals how huge is the impact of a director on a film and how impossible it is for an artist to escape his own nature.
20150|1|Surprisingly thought-provoking as extended commentary on modern life and morality.
96177|1|Brooklyn Rules has enough heart and personality to freshen what could easily be construed as stale cannoli.
2771|0|With its uneven tone, Forget Paris doesn't have enough comedy or heartfelt romance to eclipse its faults.
74859|1|A minor improvement on the original, and so a major triumph. Donkey bags the heartiest laughs, but Puss-In-Boots adds plenty of cream on top.
85707|0|as complacent as its Hillside denizens, unfortunately spawning the very mindset it rails against.
1463|0|Lacking a heart.
62522|0|Whatever charms the first one had, the sequel badly misses the Diesel-injection.
584|1|Interesting modernization of Shakespeare, before Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet.
1779|1|It's fascinating and rewarding to watch [Arquette] evolve, with much credibility, from her own personal state of immaturity to a state of full growth.
50014|0|These Skies are not only Vanilla, but a bit too familiar . . . Tom Cruise once again plays himself playing a character
36361|1|Premiering in 1952 when Chaplin was 63 years old, this melancholy reverie is a heartfelt expression of nostalgia for the Edwardian London music-halls of his youth, rich with deeply personal sentiment and warmly realized autobiographical fantasy.
76331|1|Stylish, full throttle, nobody's-pretending-this-is-art summer movie fun.
95585|0|An utterly harmless time-passer, but one which has little appeal beyond its target audience.
83954|0|...lacks in energy, top-notch humor and ultimately...a story...
76628|1|Spectacular in its reverence for the bottom rung of society.
433|0|Now and Then is successful, but only now and then.
52290|1|Funny, sweet, and intelligent.
31970|1|Brilliant, Oscar-winning period piece
60178|1|Wickedly clever French psycho-thriller about romantic obsession.
98885|0|Competent but somewhat slack, modest (and modestly budgeted) shocker that doesn't work quite hard enough to justify its plot mechanics. [Blu-Ray]
19999|1|"""Poltergeist"" is a lot more dedicated to its cause than most viewers today are probably used to. It builds to something of value. That may not make it the most profound film of its genre by any stretch, but it does make it one of the most memorable."
29843|1|[Chan's] drunken boxing in this movie is the stuff of poetry.
88739|0|"The kind of spoof that doesn't so much ""poke fun"" at its targets as it does ""lazily reference"" them."
38337|1|It's the year's funniest, most absurd sight gag.
14406|1|Enjoyable comedy thriller. Short on believability, but long on entertainment
15708|1|Woods as the ever-exasperated Hades is the comic highlight, bringing an acrid wit to the proceedings, thereby balancing out some of the over-the-top feel-good elements indigenous to the genre.
65243|0|Plagued by continuity problems, ham-fisted storytelling and a problematic voiceover by Da Brat, Civil Brand feels less like a prison movie than a prison sentence.
3070|1|Passionate tale of lost and regained love.
64389|1|Umberto D. is a film of constant desolation, a stalwart example of Neorealist cinema, and a depressive film whose recommendation depends on the benefit of the emotions it successfully elicits.
71095|1|It's so deftly made, superbly acted and relentlessly bitter that it manages to condemn repression, hypocrisy and those eager to be judgmental on a universal level.
29815|1|Clint Eastwood is the ultimate thinking man's cinematic killing machine.
81960|0|A train wreck as only Spike Lee could make it.
21386|1|Malle pulls off a minor coup here, celebrating his wounded characters even as he mercilessly reveals their dreams for the hopeless illusions they really are.
25470|1|Misplaced critical vitriol torpedoed the original 1960 release of director Michael Powell's psycho-horror. Fifty years later, it's an undisputed British masterpiece.

99795|1|Chaos Theory, starring Ryan Reynolds, confirms the underground vision of screenwriter Daniel Taplitz, who has re-imagined the screwball comedy in original terms.
74898|0|Isn?t the best film from Garry Marshall, nor is it the best performance from Kate Hudson, but it certainly is the best they?ve done in a while.
92991|0|Carrying a tracking device, the crocodile becomes visible on a beeping monitor, turning Gustave into a slightly higher-tech descendent of the crocodile who swallowed the clock in Peter Pan.
7134|1|Space Jam isn't exactly a slam dunk. It's more of a graceful tip-in by Michael Jordan, with a snazzy assist by Bugs Bunny.
62386|1|Albert Brooks in a thong is nearly worth the price of admission.
43705|0|An okay romantic comedy. A bit on the slow side.
13959|0|The movie is really an Oscar sandwich -- stale bread surrounding a big piece of ham: Geoffrey Rush.
55063|1|Devos and Cassel have tremendous chemistry -- their sexual and romantic tension, while never really vocalized, is palpable.
8038|1|Precise, simple and deeply serious beneath their breezy and seductive surface, these stories enchantingly explore love's little treacheries and the stubborn immutability of human nature.
60453|1|It isn't a film; it's a nightmare.
67354|1|A spellbinding, forceful film that refuses to be ignored.
18831|1|[An] unsettling, atmospheric film.
92736|1|A deliberate, thought-provoking, existential meditation on the curse of creating a neverending heaven on Earth.
32662|1|It's amazing how enjoyable Shakespeare can be when Kenneth Branagh isn't involved.
76160|1|another in a long line of Cyrano De Bergerac adaptations but easily one of the very best

79617|1|Rarely do you have a movie in which both lead actors give Oscar-worthy performances, but Defiance, Ohio is one.
50172|1|Yes, it's sweet and enjoyable, but it's also a bit plodding.
69776|0|Silly and violent, mostly comprised of stunts.
17652|0|Word 'pointless' is the one that should be attributed to this whole film, one of the worst to come from Hollywood in past decade and one that would test patience and temper of the audience like few others.
2884|0|I doubet whether Rose's speculative and overwroght chronicle of Beethoven will rekindle interest in the composer's life and work in the same way that Amadeus did for Mozart.
5650|1|Unevenly cast but ebulliently filmed, the film is a treasure for the Branagh-Thompson scenes alone.
79692|1|"While Robinson Crusoe on Mars is more a kitsch curio than a classic movie, there is much entertainment to be had comparing this 1964 story of ""a lone astronaut pitted against all odds beyond this Earth"" with The Martian."
100426|1|A willingness to color outside the norm of the Stargate universe is what makes this so much better than the usual Stargate SG-1 episode.
36787|1|Aurally and visually this creature feature is a treat.
26554|0|Funny for 15 minutes and then fades into mean-spirited cruelty and stupidity.
43123|1|Much to my own surprise, the newest installment of the Pokémon cartoon franchise gets my begrudging respect.
55857|1|The film weaves visual elegance, lesbian subtext, six hilariously inappropriate song-and-dance numbers and a flair for chiffon into a showcase for leading ladies of French cinema past and present.
30654|0|The ambition is evident throughout, but the execution just doesn't have enough energy to sustain it. THUNDERBALL is very sluggish.
73332|1|All in all, taken for what it is, Tremors 3 is worth a gander.
93988|1|Less a moral dilemma than a meditation on the differences between men and women in matters of social decorum.
40914|1|Finding Forrester is Gus Van Sant treading water in Hollywood, but he's making a beautiful pattern.
17688|1|Like Broadcast News, James L. Brooks' new film is a dark-edged adult comedy that hits the spot for those who like their romances splashed with acidic wit.
34122|1|Surprisingly riveting.
54530|1|Americans have a propensity for getting chummy with heroic figures of the past -- a tendency on display in this lightly amusing history lesson.
79101|1|A wonderful Capra vehicle; Cooper is superb; Arthur luminous. A comic movie with heart and a point to make. True Capra-corn, and that is not a criticism. A fine example of populist art.
95593|1|A fitfully amusing black comedy about an alcoholic assassin, its well-drawn characters drown in a generic gangster plot and a painfully low budget.
32504|1|Ah, the sweet smell of '70s American cinema when anything was possible.
78225|0|It would have made a much more powerful short than full-length movie.
48477|0|One can't fend off the feeling that we've been here before, and with some regularity.
1526|0|Eschewing personality, it mistakes pandering for insight.
50394|1|...the plot seems little more than an excuse to explore textures and generate atmosphere ... to present us with a microcosm of society worthy of Trollope.
93714|0|Christian charity, in this movie, seems like a side-effect of capitalism.
39781|1|Rains, with his silky, slightly superior-sounding voice, emerges as pathetic not grandiose, and the film clips along with boundless energy.

10754|1|...targets...religious zealots who take Jesus' simple messages of peace and love and use them...as cries for war and persecution.
34078|1|Ultimately, the film works because Schlesinger handles the comedy-to-drama transition with skill.
2587|1|...it is the ability to identify with the characters that makes the story so universal. I mean, we've all known people like these who have annoyed us all our lives.
38075|1|Allen back in shape since a really long time
49540|1|"What The Beastmaster lacks in lustre and expense, it more than makes up for in sheer ""guilty pleasure"" enjoyment."
5221|1|The Fugitive runs hard and true the whole way through.
89971|1|An agreeably shallow comedy.
2397|1|Regardless of faults, I embrace Waterworld as the pure matinee escapism it was intended to be, readily devouring the sci-fi excitement both Reynolds and Costner are happy to dish up.
65528|1|The music is really good, too. Never mind the 'story.'
10417|1|succeeds in giving us a greater appreciation for Shakespeare
2096|1|"So you wanna make a movie? Well, first, you should see ""Living in Oblivion,"" Tom DiCillo's savagely funny satire of the world of independent filmmaking."
41142|1|Mesmo recriando um incidente histórico, o filme funciona bem como thriller político e traz duas ótimas atuações de Greenwood e Culp.
50216|1|Boasting strong performances from Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis, this interracial drama of two escaped convicts is Stanley Kramer's most satisfying film, deservedly nominated for and winning Oscars.

94856|1|I think this filmmaker has a future.
90998|1|Trenchantly stages its climax around the passing of an era
27273|1|The film starts strong presenting a captivating scenario, then somewhere in the second half dips into a sappy romance.
85472|1|...provides enough variety to keep the heart, mind, and adrenaline on alert.
90887|1|Those looking for a good thriller should be pleased enough and those seeking a serious art film will get plenty of philosophy with their pretty pictures.
83780|0|Even children can't help but be bored by the movie's shadowless, textureless, weightless style of animation.
33586|1|The highlight of Ferrara's career--sublime.
57766|1|Each individual part is carefully built up and the film as a whole (if a trifle unsatisfying in retrospect) repays the evident care which has been lavished upon it.
99344|0|On a scale of one to Se7en, Miller's doomed rip barely rates.
20637|0|With Bette Midler and her onscreen sisters shamelessly hamming things up, it looks as if those involved in making this inoffensive flight of fantasy had more fun than anyone over 12 will have watching it.
16191|0|Representing an uneasy balance of Latino melodrama and arthouse fare, the film tells a lurid story (about a patriarch who's a pimp to his son) in crude manner with occasional lyrical touches; Arteta's next feature will show whether he has real talent
55725|1|That Stratton proves so unable to resist his hubris surely provides the film with a cautionary subtext, but this is beautifully complicated by an ending that denies the possibility of rehabilitation.
36473|0|Just about as bad as it sounds.
16801|1|"Messy and visceral, with an articulate, pointed anger that's recognizably British, ""Welcome to Sarajevo"" hits with an impact that's not diminished by the fact that Sarajevo's uneasy peace has held."
34909|0|It's hard to have a genuine emotional response when the manipulative mechanics are all too strongly felt.
98377|0|Adds a manic spin that strains to convey far too many moral messages while overloading the film with wacky action.
74801|1|Top-notch courtroom drama, with Bogie etching another unforgettable character.
97089|0|I think somehow the filmmakers lost the way, lost sight of the people inside the plot.
8213|0|Plodding and predictable, and a big disappointment.
45207|1|Intelligently produced historical drama.
57095|0|The plot is pretty silly but Mr. Crichton's handling of it is even sillier, though it is bold.
17124|0|Too bad it is difficult to really care about what is going on since such a thoroughly unpleasant character is at the center.
98342|0|"In fact, while sitting through this banal attempt at a big-scale epic, I could not help but go through a checklist in my mind of all the movies ""10,000 B.C."" borrows from."
62170|1|It's a strange and distant tale that would only appear on Jerry Springer in America but comes off as quirky and cute when presented from the cold Nordic perspective.
56077|1|A bubbly international cocktail.
46229|1|I LOVE this movie. Bad sequels take away from the original.
92224|0|The short and the sweet of it: Let's Go to Prison is one of the worst pieces of Hollywood garbage I have ever seen.
65883|1|Not much for teens in this book adaptation.
100134|1|Carax does not want to tell you a story. He wants to express, in the purest way he can, his infatuation with storytelling through images and genre conventions, performance and voyeurism, cinema and cinephilia.

92875|1|Portraying a real-life hero can be a tough assignment. But Zellweger breezes through the role, flashing her puckish grin, talking in her soft, breathy voice and giving very human face to one of the most beloved figures of English letters.
43675|0|...Our time with Candy and Dan, though tediously long, feels superficial.
3197|0|What results is, at best, only a sparingly funny series of mistaken identities and some really distasteful hooker gags delivered by the shocked townsfolk.
84562|0|You'll get more entertainment value by staring into your refrigerator than you will by watching this meandering meditation on what it means to be unclear on any concept you can dream up as you sleep through the movie.
52372|1|Has plenty of quips.
100006|1|Provides one of the year's more memorable movie moments: a simple shot of a barn, overlaid with both the soothing crooning of a Gilbert Becaud pop song and the terrified squeals of a hog being slaughtered.
97955|1|In the end, the only problem I see with In Bruges is that it will be a tough film to market to a mainstream audience.
15060|1|For all Cuarón's expertise in whipping up his film's elements into a pungent and frightening stew, the movie's technical brilliance can be blinding. The story and characters remain all but skeletal.
18751|0|I want to believe this latest X-Files film was created for a reason other than financial reward, but I find it difficult to guess at what that reason might have been.
72402|1|"The 14 subjects of the ""Up"" series came together as a group only twice, and by the end of 28 Up, three have dropped out of the project."
98289|0|The power of the ending comes from the inherent pain of loss, but it's no feat to recognize how emotional this would be, to tell us it's coming and to dangle it in front of us for an hour and a half.
58633|1|The film's major concept ... is a bit gimmicky, but the film has well-developed characters and style to spare.
97724|0|The latest vibrato performance of Diane Keaton's late career shame has her playing once-wealthy housewife Bridget Cardigan, whose twee name and dithering hysteria are equally insufferable.
17722|1|Yes, it's strongly geared to the teen audience, but don't hold it against the filmmakers and go in with any preconceived notions and you'll find it a fun opening chapter of a new franchise.
17009|1|A modest but engaging tale of friendship and survival.
22985|1|"Weirdness for weirness sake. I liked ""O Lucky Man"" better."
54865|0|It is cut with all the precision and timing of an irritating kids' TV show, with kids themselves in charge of the production, and their pets operating the equipment.
79930|1|One of Rohmer's greatest expressions of male-female relationships.
34251|1|More a vestige of 1950s film scandal than a significant work based on its content.
48944|0|This one may have oozed on over into September, but it's every bit as bad as the previous month's studio-floor sweepings.
54742|1|Herzog, cinematographer Jorg Schmidt-Reitwein and production designer Henning von Gierke conjure a near-endless stream of arresting images.
93475|0|Jim Carrey tries his best, but the film never gets psychologically creepy, never makes the viewer question what is fiction, what is reality, and most importantly what the number 23 is all about.
15618|0|There are chuckles to be had, but get your own continuance by waiting for the video.
73698|1|Direction by John Huston is resourceful and dynamic as he sympathetically weaves together the often-vague and philosophical threads that mark Tennessee Williams' writing.
21028|0|The whole thing is good-natured enough, but increasingly mechanical.
99675|0|While you can appreciate what the choir and the film are trying to say, too often they get bogged down in trying to spread that message. They also take themselves a little too seriously at times.
93308|0|It's watchable, but like gorging on every rotten issue of the old Confidential magazine.
58231|1|Uma comédia não apenas engraçadíssima (algo cada vez mais raro), mas também inteligente e repleta de observações importantes sobre a Sociedade norte-americana contemporânea.
20676|0|There's plenty of ammunition for a satire of pro sports -- and BASEketball isn't it.
21663|1|You'd have to be crazy not to be charmed by this movie - grab a coke and a smile.
83323|1|A cute little cartoon that ought to please very young children.
93020|1|By being more psychological in its frights, Dead Mary manages an extra layer of spookiness, but it also risks losing less patient viewers in the process.
51947|1|It's often a sloppy and muddled tale - but there are much worse ways to spend a random 90 minutes.
24518|1|A definite crowd-pleaser, although you can see the series start to slide downhill
80665|0|Cosby mugs away for all he's worth, but good gags are few and far between.
66727|0|Broderick's misplaced voice-over is just one miscalculation of many, amid the lame special effects, poorly sketched parents and forcing the great Carl Reiner to give voice to an old sheepdog's comments about flatulence.
792|1|Inventive children's yarn with good special effects.
93352|1|Even the downbeat segments are optimistic, and that's what unifies them.
82512|0|"Writer/director/actor Mike Binder (writer on HBO's ""The Mind Of The Married Man"") is to blame for this melodramatic game of Three Card Monte."
85265|1|French director Luc Jacquet and a team of incredibly brave (and heavily bundled) documentary filmmakers captured this complicated mating ritual with strikingly crisp photography that's both grand and intimate.
38711|1|One of these movies that you know aren't very good but still enjoy.
15003|0|Lynch's bizarre, dream-like approach is as fascinating as ever... and every bit as frustrating as well.
52659|1|A blissfully high-spirited romp about the circle of writers and musicians in 1830s Paris.
21350|1|A high-spirited Renaissance romance starring the thoroughly modern Drew Barrymore.
84210|1|At best, a most watchable character study of lives that are more interesting than compelling.
15665|1|There's nothing special here, but for this sort of thing, this is pretty good.
74893|0|A gift-wrapped view of pathos -- so sanitized it's almost creepy.
96305|1|Lee provides no such easy comfort, instead keeping audiences constantly off-kilter, purposefully frustrating them with character behavior that's just...wrong.
58428|1|Schepisi's Western is an underestimated film, boasting strong performances from Willie Nelson and Gary Busey
81049|1|In the mood for sublimity
93615|1|[Director] Crialese's talent for poetic illusion, and for finding the general within the microcosm, is reminiscent of Steven Spielberg.
86023|0|The whole thing is pretty dumb, and not tongue-in-cheek enough to make the dumbness fun.
65112|0|A hackneyed, mediocre offering with little to remind fans of why they like Jackie.
91827|1|It is a heartbreaking story of betrayed trust, broken faith and the misuse of privilege.
54480|1|A funny valentine to show business and marriage, an inside joke that plays humorously for anybody to grasp.
60386|0|Petroni may have chosen to move the plot along at a snail's pace to reflect the mood of Prufrock's poem, but there isn't enough lyricism in the film to save the story.
57809|1|The plot of the comeback curlers isn't very interesting actually, but what I like about Men With Brooms and what is kind of special is how the film knows what's unique and quirky about Canadians.
5562|1|...Woody Allen at his best.
91288|0|I think the men were cast more for their abs than their acting.
20178|0|Disappointing!
68987|0|It may possibly be that Mr. Spielberg has chosen gigantic size and unlimited quantity as his comedy method in the awareness that he has no gift whatsoever for small-scale comic conceits.
4149|1|There's some nice ideas and realistically felt characters here.
1769|0|Arquette seems out of place, but there's enough quality here to warrant a fair shot.
31003|1|Effective and enjoyable on all counts, with plenty of campy laughs and in-jokes.
69788|0|If you want an adrenaline rush, this will give it to you. It's worth a matinee at least.
57338|0|The comedy is nonexistent.
91197|1|Loach is on fire here. A masterfully executed mix of politics and passion, this is an example of that increasingly rare beast in modern cinema: a serious, thought-provoking film for grown-ups.
78058|1|Tess is a sensitive, intelligent screen treatment of a literary masterwork.
64609|1|One of the great teen comedies of the 80s. One reason why Cusack became what he became
62879|1|Sadly, this trenchant tribute to heroic fortitude will always be remembered more for its artifice than its artistry.
88541|1|With an eye on the Oscars, this typical MGM biopic of the 1940s, a chronicle of the famous French scientists, is middlebrow and inspirational, teaming for the third time Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon.
32240|1|...despite the clichés and stereotypes, the film's cast manages to lift it from the depths of the commonplace and make watching it enjoyable.
21173|1|A minor classic in the grand tradition of Woody Allen and is one of the best films Steve Martin has ever done.
75888|0|Inane and shopworn material with a truly cheesy final twist, this is made excruciating by direction that takes it all deadly seriously.
6830|1|After a while, besides enjoying the stories as such, we begin to enjoy the film's trickiness, almost all on the phone, as a sort of high-wire act.
86904|0|While Emmanuel's Gift has a moving story to tell, it does so in a less than compelling manner.
26164|0|The only scary thing in the entire movie is actor Ian Hendry's resemblance to George W. Bush . . .
40255|0|Maybe Adam Sandler really has some familial connections with the Devil.
36867|1|...succeeds in offering up several exciting and suspenseful sequences, though one can't help but wish that the dialogue-based moments packed the same sort of punch.
54080|1|Quite probably the best film ever made about a painter.
44192|0|Semi-Tough begins as a bawdy and lively romantic comedy about slap happy pro football players, then slows down to a too-inside putdown of contemporary self-help programs.
25160|0|Sure, there's a lot more gore and some chainsaw violence paying off for what wasn't seen in its predecessor, but this leaves a lot to be desired when all is said and done
6312|0|Rewatch the Lester film or even the Ritz Bros.
82166|1|A Scanner Darkly is capable of inducing euphoria if viewers focus on one element of splendor--the acting, concept, dialogue or animation--per viewing.
75278|1|The narrator's own haunting story is what makes this film truly mesmerizing.
69524|0|"The dramatic scheme is to show how two people ... intersect ""tragically,"" but what we see is a group of characters who act as wrongheadedly and intransigently as imaginable."
88059|0|This dyspeptic exploration of modern romance was written by TV-star Jenny McCarthy, who tailored its vulgar slapstick to her own apparently endless willingness to be the butt of raunchy gags.
41165|0|I don't see this slightly better-than-average drug thriller, with slightly better-than-average direction by Steven Soderbergh, as anything more than a routine rubber-stamping of genre reflexes.
92954|1|Like a Raymond Carver story, it seems nothing much at first sight, but its crystallised moment reveals further dimensions the more you muse on it.
98113|1|A bittersweet bedtime story about at least three babes who broke a guy's heart during his hard knocks, early adult years, in addition to, well, Bill Clinton.
71462|1|Satisfaisant, mais on commence à connaitre la chanson un peu trop par cur.
79447|1|The spiritually complete Life of Oharu represents the Holy Grail of Japanese cinema.
50576|1|If you've the patience, there are great rewards here.
64639|1|With virtually no music and very little expository dialogue, this is one of the rare films with enough faith in moviegoers to let them figure things out for themselves.
54915|1|Cohen's brainless bombast proves to be a perfect fit for this shamelessly, deliciously ridiculous reinvention of James Bond-style spy shenanigans.
53410|1|OK comedy pairs Matthau and Hawn.
46975|1|Borrowing from Hitchcock (Shadow of a Doubt) and Kubrick (The Shining), Ruben's elegant, darkly humorous tale deconstructs patriarchy and can't be divorced from the Republican family values that dominated the 1980 with their 1950s retro feel.
73322|1|Classic action adventure--maybe the best ever.
15366|1|O'Sullivan expertly stitches together these two testimonies, linked yet separated by their differing experiences of the Palestinian cause.
4256|1|Wes Craven's ultimate ego trip take on Freddy Krueger. Most interesting than good. Often dull.
96670|1|It's the imaginative background, and Fessenden's talent at insinuating it into the action, that counts -- and unnerves -- in this most chilling of global-warming movies.
66185|1|A grave warning to cheaters...Spacey's great
49807|0|That's just one of many reasons why I'm reluctant to call Behind the Lines entertainment. Propaganda, MTV-style, might be closer to the truth.
54343|0|Zebrahead is not so much a movie as notes toward a movie - a good one, judging by what's on the screen.
56084|0|Like being trapped inside a huge video game, where exciting, inane images keep popping past your head and the same illogical things keep happening over and over again.
57936|1|Its comic episodes are nicely controlled, and the movie has a consistent zany style.
40766|0|...a justifiably forgotten relic of the 1980s.
28812|1|This taut espionage thriller gained greater plausibility during its shooting when a sudden raft of sensational post-Watergate news items began coming out of Washington regarding illegal wiretaps, surveillance, and killings motivated by [politics].
64457|0|There is nothing remotely entertaining about this film.
49409|0|The result is so derivative, they should've called it Eskimo Pie.
71512|0|Like its main character, Never Die Alone is beyond redemption.
66782|0|Likable but utterly forgettable.
20317|0|The bogus art which has been creeping into the Disney pictures is really hammered at you in this one.
64954|1|If there's one saving grace of Comic Book Villains (and it's a big one), it's the eclectic group of cool indie actors populating the farce.
93336|1|The most resonant moments in Paris, Je T'Aime happen to be the bleakest, and they're about immigrants and other outsiders.
63264|1|Well-crafted late-night sleaze.
72614|1|A sort of controlled experiment in what happens when two completely incompatible movie stars occupy the same physical space.
79674|1|Fascinatingly perverse Sam Fuller film
27530|0|Veber directs with the involving, blurry speed of a shuffled deck of cards, which is about as long as The Dinner Game lingers on screen and in the memory.
30832|0|Despite Borchardt's scary self-conviction, I'm not sure we're so easily convinced he deserves to make movies--or be the star of this one.
9620|1|George Romero set a new standard for horror with this low-budget opus.
45178|1|"The actors' idiosyncratic voices, wrapped around such chrome-plated poetry as ""the great whatsit"" and ""va-va-voom,"" are as hauntingly musical as Aldrich's images."
39495|1|Though flawed and not nearly as electrifying as the material promises, the project still squeaks by thanks to taut direction and solid acting.
11204|1|... weird in all the best ways, a film of unexpected bounces and unusual shadings.
33203|1|If you liked Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure and the Wayne's World flicks, you should get guilty pleasure out of it.
41407|1|Its real power comes from Hill's potent pulp storytelling and up-front style as well as the novelty of a female hero who takes charge and controls her own destiny.
64912|1|A masterful, terribly engaging, and horribly affecting documentary.
17506|1|'Possuídos' é um filme surpreendente. Na verdade, é tão surpreendente que você só percebe que havia algo a descobrir quando o filme acaba.
34671|1|Though not as wonderful as it might have been, this film is a must for Disney fans. Typical of the studio's films, it tugs at your heart while making you laugh.
68661|1|Seen today, Stagecoach may not seem very original. That's because it influenced countless later movies in which a mixed bag of characters are thrown together by chance and forced to survive an ordeal.
53286|1|A zany look at the competitive ethos of an aggressive corporation.
84954|1|You may ... find the picture as undisciplined as Frankie's wild coif. I see the chaos, like the coif, to be tangled but pointed, an endearingly calculated mess.
48650|0|This detective melodrama has something to offend almost everyone.
58490|1|Bartel's cult classic paved the way for many rude satires about sex, murder, and cannibalism.
20581|1|When the film shifts into the action mode in its second half -- the flying saucer returns to aid in David`s rescue -- it becomes quite bright and lively.
2941|0|A borderline effort.
42043|0|Where the book kept you wondering and marvelling at the intricacies of the human mind and heart, the film has a sour, smart-alecky conclusion which highlights (what else?) the gore.
29860|0|Shankman's crassly theatrical attenuation of Hairspray only draws gay culture away from a moment of American history with which it ought to have a great deal in common
27981|1|Thrilling epic is too intense for the youngest.
5250|0|The set up is so good that it pains me to say that the last half hour falls apart. Once things are revealed, it becomes too silly.
63581|1|...provoking and stimulating to a fault, a movie that genuinely seems to care about its messages and the people it involves.
87244|1|Meadows ... very slowly builds to a powerful climax for this arty cross between Straw Dogs and First Blood.
62568|1|Young Keisha Castle-Hughes is a Down Under wonder in the lead as Pai, a spunky little Maori girl who could.
866|1|"Ask yourself ""am I the kind of person who finds topless vampire strippers a source of constant amusement?"" Only those who answer an enthusiastic ""YES!"" need apply."
69288|0|Macy wears his habitual hangdog expression like a cheap, crumpled suit that's been slept in a few too many times
94188|0|An unconvincing attempt at an old-fashioned western, Seraphim Falls works best as a chase thriller but falls apart when it tries to harness the mythic power of the American frontier.
15249|1|Garbo, who also starred in the 1927 silent version of the Tolstoy story, is radiant and vulnerable throughout the film, the centre of the emotional storm that engulfs her.
85406|0|Rarely has a film started so brilliantly and then so willfully shot itself directly in the foot.
70173|0|As the evidence mounts before us, it becomes clear that the general purpose of Reefer Madness was not pedantry, but vicarious lasciviousness.
85686|1|A spirited, high energy romp that is naught but yee-haw nonsense, The Dukes of Hazzard is a rev a second.
98927|0|The film works hard to be a dark, grown up, romantic comedy (plenty of sex, nudity, bad language and philosophy) and yet it winds up being every bit as childish as most other pictures in the genre.
76852|1|the real stars of the show: those fabulous vehicles and the awe of the miniature effects execution (which was a major influence on the work done on 2001: A Space Odyssey).
34664|1|[A] highly entertaining, relatively gentle animated feature ...
88234|0|"You watch this benumbed retelling of the ancient legend thinking, ""This, too, shall pass."""
85943|1|Quick but satisfying.
28447|0|Borderline ridiculous and ultimately pointless thriller.
9718|1|It's a visceral delight that refuses to be deterred by niceties of plot or character consistency and prefers sweat to emotion.
98468|0|Another successful and intriguing entry in Mackenzie's growing oeuvre.
44818|0|It might have been a sharper comedy by facing its real subject -- corporate conformity and PC enforcement -- but Veber has made a snickering appeal for gay rights by topping it with hetero payoffs.
88882|1|Fast-paced, tense and intermittently exciting, Donner's latest will keep genre fans engaged with its polished blend of tried and tested elements.
101684|1|Once again, Dakota Fanning demonstrates that, even as a teenager, she already has the acting skills and range equal to -- if not better than -- her A-list contemporaries.
47669|1|A harmless comedy that will make your mouth water.
3144|1|If it isn't the best American horror film of the 1930s, that's only because the extremely gifted director James Whale wasn't done with the franchise quite yet.
36858|1|What used to be an IMF team effort turned into another star vehicle for Tom Cruise.
58877|1|...ultimately an emotionally affecting and thoroughly accomplished piece of work...
95513|1|Mostly this was a quirky, smart, inspiring, and surprisingly enjoyable High School movie.
40443|1|Oscar-winning documentary shows an Olympian tragedy in rich detail.
14648|0|Boring, boring, boring kids movie with sea animals. Free Willy this is not.
100024|1|Writer-director Peter Tolan has glibness down pat, but can't quite wring the intended pathos from his characters' desperate lives. He does, however, give Broderick his best part since Election.
94734|1|Once is the anti-blockbuster that couldn't have come at a better time.
96848|0|Inflated talk of American Gangster as a modern masterpiece--or even an Oscar-worthy picture--ignores the fact that there's not a single memorable setpiece in the film.
27758|1|Kubrick stirs so many visual wonders and intellectual quandaries into the mix that the result is strangely mesmerizing and unsettlingly unforgettable.
87282|0|It's a quasi-authentic, simplistic, crime-and-rap story that become just romanticized, graphic gangsta violence.
65075|0|Marci X, though, is just clueless and sad, seemingly having missed the point that hip-hop is no longer a novelty to be slapped on the cheek with a white glove.
45938|0|It's the two Coreys at the height of their popularity; make sure your children avert their eyes... by gouging them out if necessary.
38682|1|a uniquely original and superbly accomplished work
23286|1|A powerful and disturbing motion picture!
97088|0|Everyone involved will move on to bigger and better things and leave this series of unfortunate events behind on the tracks, waiting for a midnight train to put it out of its considerable misery.
14847|1|The ﬁlm has a fairly uninteresting narrative motor in its thriller subplot, but hits on an edgy black comic tone for Stretch and Spoon's increasingly pained dealings with the unsympathetic representatives of authority.
18179|1|Solid directing and an excellent cast make for a thrilling initial 90 minutes, and even when the good actors start doing stupid things, at least you can enjoy the good acting.
76992|0|It's exactly what you would expect it to be, as long as you don't expect too much.
11068|1|It oughtn't be good, at least. Not with that script. And yet it's so much better than the combined quality of its elements.
26568|1|The movie takes a dive at the end, but it's wonderful fun before that.
80922|1|...in its genuine weirdness, a real Hollywood rarity.
66236|1|A sharp-edged slightly offbeat crime thriller for the masses.
89504|0|The Wild, for example, looks pretty good, but the script is just plain bad and the jokes are just plain awful.
12844|1|Goofball gore flick that deservedly put Peter Jackson on the map!
81098|1|No movie before this one literally made me quake.
47101|1|DeVito triumphs by instilling this caustic satire with truth and consequence.
91350|0|Benigni is floundering here, and it only gets worse as the film goes along. There's no real sense of any danger, no real identification with any of the characters. No laughs, which is what you need in a comedy.
3570|1|This is an engagingly simple, good-hearted film, with just enough darkness around the edges to give contrast and relief to its glowingly benign view of human nature.
67090|1|"Why revisit ""Shoah'' 25 years after it was first released? Because it matters more a quarter century on, just as it will matter even more in a hundred years, and 200, and - if it and we survive - a thousand."
38363|0|"""Footloose"" turns out to be a sort of Boy Scout version of ""Flashdance,"" a carefully toned-down, overly respectable piece of schmaltz ..."
88656|0|It's not so interesting to watch people on cocaine babble back and forth at each other.
87240|0|For better or worse, this is a revenge saga that refuses to take sides.
73242|0|Wearily spins straw out of its none-too-original premise.
16004|1|The strength of LaBute's conception every step of the way is in forcing the issue of where we belong in this picture -- with Chad, with Howard, or with Christine.
7714|1|Empowerment fantasies of a decimated and injured race, a kind of post-traumatic Jewish mother syndrome, or a bit of both? The film mulls these strange notions of the politics of pornography, that would have likely sent Freud's mind into a tailspin.
70622|1|Claustrophobic, taut and efficient, like a streamlined car designed to simply get you there, Trespass wastes no time in setting up its premise -- and then just barrels along with an in-your-face attitude and plenty of tightly wound tension.
98865|0|I found one vital piece of 'Nim's Island' to be ridiculous and the entirety to be only marginally successful.
70118|1|Just because Dark Passage is considered the runt of the Humphrey Bogart-Lauren Bacall litter doesn't mean it lacks its own measure of shaggy-dog charm.
29284|1|This ultra-violent powerful adventure, which deals with serious, metaphysical issues of survival and civilization vs. wilderness, boasts eerie images and awesome sounds.
61841|0|a solid thriller - until it implodes. It gives you a savory first course, then rudely dumps seconds on your plate, even though you've already lost your appetite.
33320|1|Corny and heart-warming, with O'Donnell proving almost a match for the master.
76915|0|What keeps Code 46 from living up to its fascinating premise is the lack of empathy we feel for William and Maria. They are almost like benign video game characters.
25728|1|A word of caution to anyone heading off to see The Break-Up with the assumption that it is a romantic comedy: this is not a comedy movie with a serious side -- it is a serious movie with a comedic side.
17005|0|The film never rises above the dull, comforting worthiness of a 'Masterpiece Theatre' production
42704|0|Teague, meanwhile, is far too busy orchestrating the large-scale action sequences to make anything of the cardboard characters, episodic plotting, or clunking dialogue.
58997|1|Respectful adaptation of rich Dickens novel.
64423|0|Scary, gory, nightmare-inducing slasher.
35719|1|Comedy at its best.
27034|0|"It's a shame that ""Superman"" had to leave the eighties in such a disgraceful fashion."
71582|1|Artistically resonant even as it deliberately follows a contemporary narrative structure.
6714|0|The first movie was good-hearted and I liked it, but since then Babe has raised the bar, with animals that not only talk more realistically, but say things that are wittier and more pungent.
63495|1|An impressive blockbuster that does exactly what it says.
22628|1|Even as a cynical, anti-romantic teen, I loved this movie.
66340|1|Based on Chester Himes's novel, this is a stylish, fast-moving and often humorous thriller from Deep Cover director Bill Duke.
61293|1|A real cult classic, this reimagining of the Kennedy assassination asks what might have gone down in an alternate and very similar universe.
20741|1|The most delicate and nuanced of film noirs, graced with a reflective lyricism that almost lifts it out of the genre.
1447|1|The film isn't particularly deep, but it's well written, well acted, and often laugh-out-loud funny.
85263|1|Watch them march to the very extremes of extremis, though, and it's easy to feel awe. Life must beget life, whatever the cost.

18169|1|Altman had a fine time composing difficult shots, through screens, bushes and sheets of rain, and Chungwei's images, sometimes delicate, sometimes harsh, stick with you long after you've forgotten their context.

31283|0|Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman put on an acting clinic that's a treat to watch, but, no matter how accomplished, a clinic is not a movie. They do a lot with a little, yet it's far from enough.

46856|1|A wild, weird and wonderful film.
50369|0|While the movie is on target in terms of noble intent, so much about Yentl is self defeating, and the legendary ego of Streisand can safely be deemed the culprit.

63806|1|A twisted and fascinating tale, with a climax that's as logical as it is unexpected
86629|0|... loses points for its disjointed script and fumbled field photography.
99259|0|Ignorance may be bliss, but encouraging it, as Expelled does, ought to be a crime.
70891|1|These are tales from the heart -- pulsing to a high-tech beat.
4452|0|Time paradoxes are supposed to be mind-boggling; Timecop has reduced them to a level somewhere between confusing and dumb.
35084|1|It's the closest any film of the era comes to predicting the mission-based Miami world of the recent video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.
61220|1|Truffaut clearly communicates his consummate love for film in ways certain to bring knowing smiles to all movie lovers
46583|1|Travolta merges into middle age in this surprisingly winning family comedy.
37594|0|Portentous and dull, the film features one of the worst over-the-top performances by Dennis Hopper, who plays an abusive father. His role upends what could have been a mildly interesting family drama.
89274|0|Fluff at best, but buckets and buckets of blood for those that care about such things.
85485|1|This charming, funny film takes a gentle poke at Little League baseball and the American obsession with winning.
66846|1|Peter Hedges has made a simple and sweet movie that will leave you misty eyed.
38163|1|An elegant soap.
41230|0|John Huston is the wrong director, lacking appreciation for the musical genre
79527|1|The Bad Sleep Well's ground-breaking concept shows Kurosawa's uncompromised ambition.
82940|1|Memories of Murder is such a taut, effective thriller it's a shame you have to read subtitles to gauge just how good a movie it is.
9209|1|Grant gives his role his assured style of acting, meaning the dialog and situations benefit. Kelly, too, dresses up the sequences in more ways than one.
47567|0|It's kind of funny, although Smith works under the assumption you've seen all his movies.
56346|1|DVD is a treatise on the famed D.H. Lawrence short story.
79530|1|One of Kurosawa's finest achievements.
26421|0|Drew Barrymore has been well cast as someone who doesn't act her age.
52313|0|Less a heartfelt appeal for the handicapped than a nice Belgian waffle.
74147|1|Renner carries much of the film with a creepy and dead-on performance.

77168|1|Easily one of 2004's most thrilling adventures.
61017|1|To be frank, The Awful Truth is awfully unimportant, but it is also one of the more laughable screen comedies of 1937, a fairly good vintage year.
27143|1|The film itself is a lot of fun -- but the audience-participation phenomenon has turned it into a one-of-a-kind cinematic experience.
32854|0|One can't help feeling that the criticism of modern America hits out at all too easy targets in a vague and muffled manner.
28858|0|One of the least endurable films of 1999!
46029|1|For pure eighties, punk rock, walking dead, brain eating mayhem, this is the film to watch.
51451|1|Bright comedy, but nothing great
84600|1|Baroque gun-toting fantasy and an uneasy sound track by the 1960s Zombies make this the heavy teen self-destruct flick of the year.
15459|1|Pure eye-candy and a rollicking good-time.
15361|0|"Volcano is an absolutely standard, assembly-line undertaking; no wonder one of the extras is reading a paperback titled ""Screenwriting Made Easy."""
70568|1|These dysfunctional characters seem so real, thanks to excellent acting by everyone involved and to Billy Bob Thornton's intuitive writing and directing.
14431|1|Powerhouse casting and a heartbreaking history make the screen version of Marvin's Room more memorable than it otherwise would be.
6440|0|Almodovar's central parody is strong enough to save this film from floundering too much or too often. It's daring and nasty, but rarely brilliant.
32253|1|Darabont explores the range of human kindness and cruelty as he lovingly and patiently sculpts his large cast of characters against magnificent scenery.
46079|1|A movie for kids of all ages, with enough pace and effects to amuse the youngsters and humour plus message to engage adults.
85980|1|It's a happy and welcome debut, showing not only a genuine sense of humour and technical brilliance, but a clever ability to combine serious themes with family entertainment.
41911|0|Halfway through this live action version of the popular early 1980s kiddies TV show, I wondered what I had done wrong to deserve all this pain and suffering.
36486|1|Gladiator has the distinction of being both timely and nostalgic.
71669|1|Harmoniously blends elements of a coming-of-age story, a crime drama and a mystery together in something of astonishing power and scope.
333|0|A big, noisy headache of a movie...
64595|0|Why must film-makers always be such slaves to the lowest common denominator?
91452|1|Land of Plenty isn't for everyone, but patient viewers will be rewarded with a poignant look at life in America today.
56774|0|Sure, this one's got gore galore and a boatload of atrocious acting performances to giggle at, but without Jason doing the stalking - it's just not a Friday the 13th movie.
58520|0|It's interesting that Rob Schneider's comedies are getting progressively worse as they are released.
23966|1|one of the all time greatest monster movies
100592|1|When a movie opens with the diner scene from When Harry Met Sally as performed by cadavers, and later proceeds to sex scenes involving scalpels and needles, the actual plot becomes inconsequential.
39479|0|It's hard to imagine anyone walking out of this movie satisfied, regardless of Hackman's and Freeman's solid performances.
36283|0|Gossip is mostly hot air.
40905|0|The leaden screenplay can be fingered for many of the film's faults. But what happened to the off-kilter film-maker last seen at work in To Die For?
38539|0|As a product of an unusually adventurous time in cinema history, Greaser's Palace has perverse appeal. As a comedy, it's virtually unwatchable.
71250|0|Depp's ... wonderfully frazzled portrait of seething resentment almost makes this minor thriller seem fresh.
80649|1|"The nostalgic delights in Waters's reform school drool are often more subtle than his other period offering, Hairspray, but it's still a polished debunking of pop culture from the ""Pope of Trash""."
65143|1|Without resorting to schmaltz or sticky pathos, director Vladimir Michalek fashions an allegory about aging, friendship and love that equals the best American movies on those tricky subjects, from Cocoon to On Golden Pond.
13228|1|The movie invites us to share a life in which all emotional desire has been bound, subjugated, organized into a bleakly funny -- and finally tragic -- game.
95679|0|A stronger screenplay and more sensitive direction would have made this movie into something far more genuinely uplifting than it is.
59469|0|While Sugar Hill boasts a hearty collection of excellent performances, those assets are nearly negated by a directorial style that can best be described as...languid.
74487|0|The details are minutely observed and, to me, just a bit boring.
69705|1|The film is well made, well acted, cleverly written, photographed by Wilfrid Sempe as if he's a conspirer with the sexual schemers.
78465|1|Director Robert Zemeckis once again harnesses a new technology to an engaging fable in this digitally animated adaptation of Chris Van Allsburg's holiday tale.
38888|1|This is a smooth production of an obvious, though suspenseful murder thriller, ably acted and directed. Mood and pace are well set, and story grips throughout.
6945|0|Without an outsize directorial vision it looks even more like sub-007 than the others did.
7917|1|Though exceedingly long (over 4 hours), this is an intelligent and insightful chronicle of the eccentric French poet and philosopher who died in 1948
4092|1|While the movie may act like a madeleine for television-obsessed baby-boomers, it works even better as a colorful playland that will appeal to small children.
33677|1|A truly stellar directorial debut by Ben Affleck.
93054|1|The characters, especially those of the two ten-year-old protagonists, ring true and when, just past the midway point, tragedy strikes it's quite devastating.
32071|1|For two-thirds of The End of the Affair [Jordan] does an astonishing job of fusing his pop-magical temperament with Greene's astringency and wit.
78944|1|The Golem, carefully crafted and visually impressive work, has lost little of its power over the decades.
42723|1|Michael Mann is in top form here helming this bone-chilling thriller based on the novel by Thomas Harris.
7448|0|Nowhere near as fresh, funny, subversive, and sexy as it initially promises.
16205|1|The Hollywood stuff at the beginning with Glenn Close as an Oscar presenter and Matt Dillon as a puffed-up star on the rise is as funny and as nasty as anything in Libby Gelman-Waxner's columns.
2421|0|Just when Travolta got his groove back..
20176|0|Too many scenes float above reality!
34834|1|Some of the issues get lost in the mix, but strong performances by Lee and Fishburne make this a watchable and thought-provoking venture.
77469|1|... pure guilty-pleasure entertainment... a one-gimmick pony that amazingly holds your attention for ninety minutes...
76506|1|Has just enough clever bits to help you through the groaners.
96238|0|Those zombies are back on the march in the third instalment of the horror-action series that plays like a rip-off of George A Romero's Day Of The Dead, only with a much lower IQ.
1048|0|Dunston Checks In -- Wish I hadn't.
94118|0|"He lays the photos out on the floor and the burn marks form a cross with a hook at the bottom, the unmistakable emblem of '70s hard rockers Blue Oyster Cult. Hey, didn't they have a big hit called ""(Don't Fear) the Reaping""?"
68406|1|"Real darkness seethes beneath the ""Once upon a time"" surface, mostly due to Henson's seemingly curious selection of the brilliant and audacious Roeg to direct."
54945|1|While Broomfield's film doesn't capture the effect of these tragic deaths on hip-hop culture, it succeeds as a powerful look at a failure of our justice system.
86511|1|Though Roberto Rossellini's Francesco, giullare di Dio...tells stories of a Roman Catholic saint, it should not be branded merely as a religious film.
87476|1|Steve Buscemi's third film as a director is a low key affair delivered with a wry sense of humour.
64266|0|Le Divorce is tres mediocre.
58559|0|It's a shame The Next Generation crew went out on this flat note.
64030|1|What keeps us involved in this perceptive film is the beautiful acting of its cast ... and the way the movie balances grim reality with bits of fancy that feel oddly perfect.
73189|1|OK, it's not Greek tragedy, but it is based (loosely) on Xenophon, so there.
27493|0|All of this holds a strange fascination, but it does get somewhat redundant after a while.
65837|1|So thorough is the cinematic journalism that you'll swiftly forget what a challenge it must have been to document or simulate all of the key moments in a story that spans thousands of years of history.
25258|1|This is an impressive debut film.
43200|1|It's a film about film, and Hu's love of the medium's storytelling power shines through every frame.
51963|0|Soderbergh's movie likely will appeal more to filmmakers than filmgoers.
95917|1|A deconstructionist horror comedy that owes a debt to Scream and the 1992 Belgian film Man Bites Dog, Mask nevertheless has enough pitch-perfect wit to lay claim to its own patch of postmodern, movie-loving snarkiness.
68151|0|Another failure in Harmon's attempt to move from TV to the big screen.
14981|0|This is not the sort of comedy that asks much of a viewer, and it's not as if you have to engage your brain.
4945|1|The film is very well written. The characters are well developed, the dialogue is sharp and the story is involving.
93534|0|...an amiable misfire.
18616|0|...simpers along with relatively little suspense or thrills...
86633|0|While the movie is a thoroughly generic sports movie, there's no denying that it works as a rousing example of the genre.
50958|1|A visionary science-fiction spectacle; a still relevant dramatization of 'class warfare'; a pulp nightmare of Freudian-Marxist-Christian symbolism and Expressionist-Futurist-Old Testament imagery; and a source of inspiration for Nazis and Utopians alike.
37583|0|...a lifeless movie about uninteresting people.
36684|0|Only masochists will enjoy Whipped, a cynical sex comedy that manages to be infantile and jaded at the same time.
88386|0|I found this Oscar-nominated film overlong and ultimately disappointing.
38724|0|The real invisible man here is Verhoeven, whose talent can barely be seen in Hollow Man.
64424|0|Director Ronny Yu loses energy when it shifts to the dumb teen protagonists, and the script faithfully wallows in cliches so ridiculous they border on Scary Movie territory.
47569|0|The epitome of self indulgence.
53149|0|"Making a ""feather-light"" comedy isn't an excuse for making a bad movie."
17668|0|Sphere winds up just a load of balls.
34709|1|Julia Roberts winner. R mostly for language.
101193|1|Engaging, bittersweet and frequently laugh out loud funny, this is an enjoyable Spanish drama with strong performances and a subtle but effective message.
50023|0|Made by people who seem to think that tracking degenerate behavior is more important than character development
34431|1|Solid, entertaining film noir.
91181|1|A fond and always accessible portrait, but the lack of objectivity and drooling images of Gehry's work deprives this documentary of any objectivity.
37808|1|The Conversation is for me the masterpiece of American cinema.
94694|0|Here's a sobering thought: If every war gets the comedy it deserves, could Delta Farce, a strenuously unfunny Three Amigos knockoff, be our M*A*S*H?
27429|1|Travolta wins hands down with his accent in a pleasingly intense performance that helps propel the story along.
64913|1|In the spirit of the best nostalgic village pics, only one thing happens, and yet it turns out to mean everything to its characters.
98452|0|For Romero, someone who still retains respect and admiration for previous work, Diary of the Dead points to the realization that it is time to close the door on zombie movies and move to other horror subjects.
76098|1|The acidulous palette of the costumes and the décor conjure Ray's insolent, isolated fury; though the action is set in the nineteenth century, the actors break out of the story to foreshadow the stylishly electric revolutions to come.
45675|1|Murphy has dealt audiences the movie equivalent of a royal flush and he is now clearly Hollywood's reigning king of comedy.
8893|1|Sparkles with all the vigor of freshly uncorked champagne.
17938|0|A Price Above Rubies isn't a particularly good movie, though Zellweger shines in a tough, gritty role that foreshadowed her more serious acting ambitions.
12089|1|Heroes, villains, desperados, and the inevitable shoot-outs: You'll find them all in what a lot of fans consider Leone's best film.
49402|0|In failing in every base it tries to cover, there's no point in seeing Out Cold, for such preferable alternatives exist.
17396|0|When even the outtakes you see over the end titles don't raise a single titter, you know you're in trouble.
40887|0|Falha como comédia, como drama e como romance.
2079|1|Frightening, frank and serious, a wake-up call to the world.
91124|1|The film is so appealing and so human (at least when it keeps its focus) that it's hard to resist its charms.
68152|1|Summer School might lack a hipster razor edge, but its funnybone personality is larger than life. It's a film I adore for its purity of intentions.
6653|1|quite a BANG!
67415|1|Through its emphasis on characters and not merely action, Master does not let us forget that all individuals are souls with flesh and blood, not merely empty casualties of war.
33067|1|Woman in the Dunes remains a masterpiece, a timeless contemplation of life's essential mystery and a triumph of bold, innovative style.
23410|1|Wrenching Holocaust fable with bittersweet humor.
56707|0|The film wasn't preachy, but it was feminism by the book.
96357|0|"Imagine what ""Catch-22"" might have been like if it had been written by that creepy grade-school classmate of yours who was always talking about how cool it would be to stick a cherry bomb under that dead squirrel he found on the side of the road"
91461|1|Mr. Pálfi's grandiose vision and technical bravado are nothing short of mesmerizing, yet there are also plenty of tender moments amid the go-for-broke follies.
48328|0|Un suspense qui profita abondamment de la largesse d'esprit du cinéma américain de l'époque, peut-être même un peu trop...
77237|1|Convoluted though this plot may seem, at least the inventive visuals from Gangster No 1 director Paul McGuigan keep you engrossed.
20583|1|Flight of the Navigator, in spite of a rough beginning, soars as it should, taking a child on the journey of his life.
6128|1|The film swings like a pendulum between stillness and action, an occasionally jarring mix of David Lean-like panoramas with intimate character study.
67552|1|The movie's one joke -- which will endure for the ages -- is the defamation of the Christmas spirit by Billy Bob Thornton, who stars as a drunken, chain-smoking, dirty-minded, incontinent, foul-mouthed and larcenous department-store Santa.
83714|0|It loses a great deal in the translation from Stockholm to San Francisco's Dirty Harry country. Gloomy authenticity, for one thing; pace and a genuine sense of puzzlement, for others.
248|1|Casino is Scorsese's 'messy drawer' of a movie; disconnected scenes and stylistic odds and sods... it might be his most idiosyncratic.
72975|0|Embarrassingly flavorful as a Hollywood religious delicacy.
22821|1|One True Thing is real enough to be a film you can believe in.
65915|1|A few too many amateurish techniques and oversimplified confrontations hold Luther back a notch or two from greatness, and stamp it instead as entertaining Lutheran cheerleading.
37409|1|Flatliners is a stylish, eerie psychological horror film laced with wit, a movie that thrives on its characters' guilty secrets and succeeds on the strength of the director Joel Schumacher's flair for just this sort of smart, unpretentious entertainment.
62541|1|As character studies of Jack and Claire, it is daring and inventive, and worthy of comparison with the films of a French master of criminal psychology like Jean-Pierre Melville.
57960|1|A stylish, involving, unremittingly grim and, it must be stated, almost wholly derivative hodge-podge of hard-boiled American crime thrillers. The surfeit mood catches and holds your attention, sometimes in spite of yourself.
6467|0|Exciting as La Scorta might be, it is at heart a conventional thriller that breaks no new genre ground.
48460|1|Some funny moments, but misses a chance to really skewer its subject.
76336|0|Its over-edited style smacks of panic, the CGI cat woman is plainly not real, and the broadside it fires at the beauty industry is only limp at best.
60400|0|A turgid, pretentious piece of work that may have played well on the page, but is too heavy and slow-moving to work on the big screen.
58676|1|. . .one of the year's most insightful and evocative films.
79983|1|... 'road rage' taken to new heights of exploitation by the boy wonder.
43988|0|Leave it to Bay and Bruckheimer to reduce one of America's biggest military tragedies into a three-hour avalanche of Kodak moments, and one of America's defining crises into a facile exercise in fake uplift.
61260|1|One of the best--and most underrated--noirs.
75809|1|In fits and starts it's faintly cool, though the tone is all over the place.
14939|1|Pleasantly entertaining and intelligent, it does not create enough of a spiritual mystery to move the heart, but watching the characters droolingly circle one another has its own, more earthly rewards.
5372|1|The movie has a clear, simple thriller logic that's far more satisfying than the static variations-on-a-massacre construction of Eastwood's Dirty Harry pictures and spaghetti Westerns.
87511|1|... her jokes ... are often obliteratingly funny in themselves, they are compounded and deepened by the disconnect between the blackness of their substance and the pretty mouth that utters them
16027|0|In the hands of stars in denial about their stardom and a director who can't be bothered to take things seriously, it has come out implausible and unsatisfying, a comic thriller that is not especially funny or thrilling.
81240|1|Reminds us what a vulnerable undertaking acting can be, and what an intimate, manipulative, caring and torturous act directing is.
48143|1|La cinta en el global es una opción atractiva si buscan una cinta ligera y que hable de un amor posible en un grupo de caóticos seres que cohabitan en ese micro-universo
14931|0|No laughs in this one at all. Who decided to write a movie about a club designer? Boring concept, no chemistry.
48584|0|Fright fans expecting anything more than the occasional jolt will be sorely disappointed.
17425|0|Alan Rudolph's romantic roundelay sounds a lot more interesting than it plays.
49076|0|Already burdened by Kate's clichéd voice-over observations, the movie eventually sinks beneath the weight of Kate and Adam's utter charmlessness, a huge liability in bickering romantic-comedy couples.
92469|0|Beneath the shocking brutality in Blood Diamond is the story of father searching for his son which, thanks to Mr. Hounsou's work, is nearly worth the price of admission.
35051|0|Less amateurish than the 1990 original, less embarrassing than the 1991 sequel (with its mind-boggling Vanilla Ice ninja-rap number), this may be the easiest installment in the series for parents to sit through.
47827|0|Fox and Chestnut, with their fine looks and fine wardrobes, are all dressed up for a party that most guests bailed on in the last days of the old millennium.
47162|0|This feels like a movie with its heart ripped out.
38192|1|A hodgepodge of skits, some of which are better then others. It hasn't dated very well, but if you love the Airplane movies, this should make you laugh a bit every now and then.
74523|1|Lloyd's most famous film with the great building climbing climax.
73062|1|By the end, we know these characters so well that just seeing any two of them meet draws tears
47644|0|smugly self-congratulatory... shooting fish in a barrel
49769|1|It's more of a novelty item than a film, really, and most of the fun comes from seeing just about all of Hollywood's most well-known faces show up in the span of two hours.
97634|0|Well cast, slickly produced and performed with enough spirit to somewhat counterbalance its frequently stupendous lack of originality and plausibility. Still not quite good enough, though...
70108|1|Story and reality so often become mixed in High Sierra that it's hard to separate the two...
59216|1|A gripping Hitchockian thriller based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith.

77602|1|Breillat, as usual, leaves us gasping.
16239|0|"The plot works on a mechanical level, but ""The Peacemaker"" reveals the Bond movies are smart to oil the cogs with humor and sex appeal."
14832|0|An absolutely terrible movie, a comedy devoid of laughs.
72750|1|Despite the star caliber, it's a minor movie--a curiosity--for both actor-director Olivier and star-producer Monroe, in large part due to the weaknesses of the source material and direction.
22999|1|An overlooked Woody Allen gem
19253|1|It is an important film from any angle, presenting socko entertainment for big business.
94605|0|... a mindless muddle - loud, slowly paced, and overdone; in other words, it is exactly like a bad Hollywood blockbuster, except for the subtitles.
56490|1|A classic of political debate.
37331|1|Dirty Harry feels like a lucky punk once again.

30793|0|O que poderia ser uma boa história transforma-se em um emaranhado confuso de clichês.

95095|1|Notwithstanding its quintessentially indie need to develop character through quirk rather than, y'know, characterisation...the opening fifteen or twenty minutes are actually pretty great.
100257|1|Oscar-winning Polish writer/director Andrzej Wajda is now 83 years old. But he thankfully hasn't lost his ability to outrage viewers for all the right reasons.
38921|1|The writing in this movie, by Duncan North, Greer Goodman and Jenniphr Goodman, among others, is as smart as anything I've seen in the past year.
50614|0|Tom Dey directs with all the energy of a cook flipping burgers at Jack in the Box.
13949|1|It robustly apes James Cameron's Aliens, even down to the head villain, played with kinky boo-hiss relish by Alice Krige, who appears to be channeling equal parts Cameron's Alien Queen and Marlene Dietrich.
40098|1|When sticking with Billy and his inspirational story, director Stephen Daldry hits all the right steps.
95649|1|The photography of Arctic Tale is what makes it so good. The nature documentary style of this movie is brilliant and breathtaking at times.
47667|1|While this cheerful film has nothing particularly new to say about the ties that hold family members together even when they're driving each other crazy, it's a pleasure to watch such a talented ensemble at work.
76517|1|Map of the Human Heart is one of those rare films that illuminates a single human story, and does it so well that you're hardly aware you're watching a movie.
77088|1|Laurent Cantet makes a brilliant feature debut in this timely and compelling French drama, in which a young man learns to take personal responsibility in both work and familt matters.
19412|1|Fascinates us in an almost perverse way, gripping us with its tension, thrilling us with its action, and troubling us with its dystopic view of American society circa 1971.

17493|0|The first half of this movie holds some promise, but time is not on its side.
36750|1|A purely creative movie that one must admit has no equal in cinema history (for better or worse). [Blu-ray]
16918|1|The stories are often heart-wrenching and often inspirational. If this is a woman's film, it at least is miles ahead of something like Beaches.
41167|1|Mr. Soderburgh never insults or spoon-feeds his audience. His camera only documents and observes what's out there. And with a subject like this, that can be the most effective technique.
81963|0|Allusions to Frank Wills, the security guard who discovered the Watergate break-in, suggest a story that would have made a much better Spike Lee movie than this misfire...
53213|1|Overall, this examination of manufactured corruption set against a film noirish swagger may not have the in-depth impact like contemporaries L.A. Confidential or Memento, but this Sea is certainly worth swimming in

30899|1|Crichton does Cook in this engaging (if dated) medical thriller.
67728|1|This inventive nail-biter is very much a product of its time -- blending the arms-race unease of the early 1980s with the beginning of the home-computer revolution -- but it still manages to both grip and entertain.
23246|1|This is romance the way Hollywood used to make it, with both conflict and tenderness, at times capturing the texture of the day-to-day, at times finding the lyrical moments when two lovers find that time stops.
43718|1|"Carax is a visual director and ""Pola X"" works best when he uses his locales and set design to excellent effect,"

96507|0|The Comebacks is probably the worst movie that's sludged across my professional eyeballs -- worse than Daddy Day Camp, Baby Geniuses 2, and BloodRayne.
94659|1|Lovely and cold as a Nordic winter sky, Away From Her is a lacerating, tough movie that's sometimes hard to watch - and impossible to forget
41115|1|It is fun to watch as entertainment and indeed as a work of art.

76993|1|lance is the man
19706|1|John Hughes's 1985 film seems meant to explain 80s youngsters to yesterday's youth, and comes to the comforting conclusion that they're just as alienated, idealistic, and vulnerable as the baby boomers of the 1960s.
50970|0|Solondz has finally brought his critics into the frame, if only in an attempt to subject them to the same torture as everyone else.
2297|0|Something to Talk About is weary -- every ounce of energy and originality has long since been wrung out of this formula, and the 'twist' of having the leads already married doesn't do much to spice up things.

26221|1|A most pleasant and diverting venture.
90638|1|'Night at the Museum' has a setup that's so juicy, it's easy to forgive the film when it falls short of its potential.
48667|1|Cruising can now be ranked among Friedkin's very best films.
88793|0|The narrative is so jumbled that even the actors can't seem to keep track of what exactly is meant to be happening.
6651|0|Film at 145 minutes is far over-length, and should be tightened extensively, particularly in first half.
68574|1|The acting is properly larger than life, especially Klaus Kinski as the title character, a lean, driven but imposing man who has heads lopped off when in any way interfered with in his task of destruction and exploration.
48628|1|The story's impact is reduced by the filmmakers' decision to make everyone who is part of 'the system' not just complicit in the conspiracy, but also lacking humanity.
89465|1|It's remarkable how charitable, on the whole, this movie feels; in all of the previous examples, the vision of pop and people is at best tangled, at worst jaundiced.

6371|1|Black comedy Kubrick classic for smart teens+.
17179|1|I think Clint Eastwood's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is a great movie.
78030|1|Both genders are programmed by eons of Darwinian genetic strategy, and so we believe them, and because Linney and Grace are sexy and play well together, the age gap is not a barrier so much as additional seasoning.
7996|0|Terrible messages about relationships. Ed Burns is a mysoginist. But some laughs, could be worse.
48842|0|Very hard to take with the film sitting up and practically slobbering in its eagerness to prove how loveable it is.
49671|1|Infectious and moving and sometimes bittersweet.
27300|1|Consider giving this worthy anachronism a couple of hours of your time. If you can tune into its somber, hypnotic wavelength, you may be surprised at the raw emotional impact it delivers in key scenes, and at its ability to provoke your imagination.
46149|1|John Carpenter's They Live has cult favorite written all over it, and part of the reason is the way it regenerates the cheap, juicy, surprisingly potent sci-fi of the 1950s.
71304|1|This story could take place anywhere there are families struggling to remake themselves in the aftermath of tragedy; its universality is perhaps the most potent political message of all.
17119|1|A gripping portrait of an unforgettable character.
6646|1|a work of art, and revives love for pure cinema
52041|1|Clever one-liners and a screenplay that doesn't try too hard to be poignant or contrived make for an easy-going film that will lead to interesting post-movie discussion.
92047|0|Accomplished and visually persuasive, but the movie's central conceit remains something of a stunt...
87622|1|One of the most self-assured debuts of all time, a work so certain in its conception and execution that almost 40 years later I'd still quickly rank it as one of Argento's finest.
96939|0|The characters are not complex or memorable enough to linger in the mind much past the closing credits.
32896|1|A gripping three-character film that plays out like Hitchcock on the High Seas.
26321|1|How many films are about a woman's sexual awakening? A film that puts a woman's desire before family without offering a moral judgment or offering a male fantasy?
50761|0|Stylistically, it resembles a well-intentioned, earnest TV problem drama from the late '60s.
35227|1|Visually stunning and emotionally wrenching...an uncommonly graceful and deeply moving portrayal of the hopes and desolation of childhood.
82994|0|A tawdry cocktail of red herrings, cheap psychology, and shameless horror-movie tropes.
56546|0|It's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread.
85622|1|It has everything the TV series possessed, but also manages to elevate the tension to the next level.
78966|1|Keaton's third feature under his own steam is an incredible technical accomplishment, but also an almost Pirandellian exploration of the nature of cinematic reality.
72396|1|...the ghostly samurai court listening to Hoichi, and the samurai battle effectively form visual haikus that remain in the mind's eye
72517|1|Irresistibly campy Ayn Rand adaptation.
90046|1|Peevishly defensive, intransigently personal and serenely indifferent to critical (and audience) reaction
79455|0|Crafting his meditation on the men who answer the call of the wild, Sean Penn's adaptation is heavy on mood and ambiance but sadly lacking in depth, giving up on the wider comparisons to focus fully on McCandless, who may not be up to the scrutiny.
23351|1|Great movie for high schoolers and their parents.
37268|1|"""In heaven, everything is fine,"" but in Eraserhead (1977) nothing is fine. David Lynch's debut feature is grim, disturbed, mutated, claustrophobic, a world that appears to be unraveling-or, more accurately, decaying-before our eyes."
79625|1|Just as the characters' loyalties to one another are called into question, so, too are ours: Becket enters a moral grey area from which it never fully emerges.
71071|1|Persona is made up of clinical compositions, austere acting and stark lighting courtesy of legendary lensman Sven Nykvist. Yet it's this very severity that gives the film its crisp beauty.
62171|1|A film that's as outlandish as it is entertaining.
41829|1|It's good to have friends on the inside, you know?
35491|1|"As for Mr. Cusack, there's nothing potential about his stardom any more. He's the self-doubting, self-flagellating, self-ironic soul of ""High Fidelity,"" and he's great."
54019|0|"The love triangle seems lifted out of ""Pearl Harbor"", and if there's a war movie from which you don't want to take inspiration, it's that one."
74432|1|A somewhat stilted but still emotionally and intellectually engaging glimpse at profound and challenging questions of the role of memory in our sense of identity.
64932|1|Zhang Yimou focuses so frequently on Ziyi's face in extreme close-up that she sticks like a daguerreotype to your retina -- and then your heart.
31238|0|A film so critical of others' attitudes should perhaps have given more positive vetting to its own.
2905|0|The Hunted . . . has the pacing of a chase movie, the atmosphere of a horror film and the tired formula of a morally bankrupt Tinseltown action flick.
40409|1|"Ben and Gwynneth, ""just friends"" or no, have a lovely, believable chemistry that isn't all hot sex or amusing rapid fire witticisms."
50485|1|As light and insubstantial as one could wish.

4433|0|Speechless is overplotted and underwritten. Every situation is straight out of stock, with no room for variation or originality.
25009|0|"""This is very stoopeed, Stevie."" I must have repeated that line to myself a dozen times before this abysmal techno-thriller shuddered to a much-appreciated end."
21821|0|Oddly, the troubled Cliff is more sympathetic than the two self-involved protagonists.
34633|0|We don't care about some dumb diamond the size of a baseball, and as Muppet fans we're probably also indifferent to Henson's ambition to satirize old movie genres.
61313|1|Discount its distinctly casual approach to the mechanics of a multi-million Euro robbery, and it's not bad at all.
50583|1|Mr. Tsai is a very original artist in his medium, and What Time Is It There? should be seen at the very least for its spasms of absurdist humor.
7380|1|The animation is fairly unexciting though serviceable, and the overall mystification of class difference would probably have made Dickens shudder, but kids should find this tolerable enough.

74434|1|Lang's late-period masterpiece
18495|1|The plot is clever. The acting is genuine.
8520|0|The film often seems pointless and labored or overly contrived - and it certainly suffers from foul-language overload.
32412|1|A lightweight affair... Despite some momentary flashes of brilliance, this is no successor to the great Fantasia.

54141|1|It is the sweetest Disney movie of its generation; but the lengthy beginning and somewhat shorter climax drag it down at the worst possible points.

5716|0|"This desperate attempt to keep the franchise alive and kicking resorts to a backhanded kind of political correctness: introducing a surly teenage girl karate expert who goes around talking about ""kicking butt."""
37643|0|Perfectly dreadful in every respect, this big-budget remake of the late H.B. Halicki's 1974 indie hit may well rep the nadir of the Bruckheimer (and Simpson) franchise, and doesn't even rate on the most basic level as a good car-chase picture.
93877|0|I think the actress smiles a total of once in 100 minutes on screen. Granted, it's radiant when she does, but that's not enough to save the film.

63706|1|Funny and alive and visually delightful.
27061|1|The set, shot in a style reminiscent of the German Expressionist classics, is superb.
31531|1|Repulsion wastes no time before plunging its audience into the frighteningly disturbed mindset of its central character.
31580|1|Offers a light wit that is oftentimes funny.
41526|1|With the ever-charming Keaton in the lead, the flick turns out to be as harmlessly entertaining as it is outlandishly unrealistic.
86407|0|Aims for starkness but ends up as tastefulness
28797|1|While its thriller elements deliver, the film is undermined by a subplot that was surely over-egged even when it was made and which has only been further diminished by the passage of time.
84601|1|Caught the big picture in a strikingly fresh way.
11700|1|High on tension, low on fat and fully deserving of its reputation as one of the finest war films ever made.
65302|0|Too often crosses the line between good melodrama and rank cliché.
25929|1|Signifying Monkeys
55161|0|In a better movie, we wouldn't feel compelled to choose which fighter to root for.
54801|1|The plot is the usual hokum and Edward Mulhare isn't really eccentric enough to compete in the villainy stakes, but Coburn is plainly enjoying himself so much, and the trimmings are so stylish, that it's impossible not to enjoy.
2034|0|"Should have called it ""Johnny Moronic"""
88068|1|...a graceful, lyrical masterpiece wound around one of the most natural and engrossing performances by a child actor we've ever seen.
84464|0|The script, by TV writer Wayne Conley, shares some elements with the old Danny DeVito comedy Ruthless People, but humor isn't one of them.
48871|1|Somehow, the movie taps into the book's uncanny implication that the very air is charged with malevolent ancient spirits...
46678|1|The best in mindless entertainment.
79047|1|One of the most well-known and best of the early classical gangster films is Warner Bros.' Little Caesar (1930) - often called the grandfather of the modern crime film
57892|0|This saga about two friends falls short of heartfelt and never satisfies
95385|1|A wackily surreal, primary-coloured fairytale from a graphic novel by Neil Gaiman.
67400|0|Jenna Elfman needs to be in more movies and Brendan Fraiser, who should have gotten an Oscar for at least two movies I can think of, is underused even though he's in most of the scenes.
76269|1|Faithful to the award winning play.
9364|1|Less a crime film than a study in levels of obsession, Laura is one of those classic works that leave their subject matter behind and live on the strength of their seductive style.
87513|0|Perhaps the film's disparate subplots are given due attention in the book, but it all feels unfocused and jammed together here.
24995|0|A paint-by-numbers story that offers no surprises and a hero and villain etched in white and black with few shades of gray.
99324|0|Korine has found an evocative subject, but he remains entirely too cavalier in this attitude towards narrative coherence.
1230|0|[A] one-joke Caddyshack for the blitzed and jaded.
54307|0|One or two laughs, but hardly worth a rental.
74239|0|She ends up being exactly what you expect a porn star to be like
46041|1|Great re-interpretation of the Romero series. Scary in its hopelessness, funny in its extremity.
10540|1|Shows that honesty and humanity aren't incompatible with comedy in modern Hollywood.
82265|1|Here, now, is the true face of human barbarity, and the true face of human heroism. Not in the now-distant mythology of World War II
33233|1|Cinema's singular dream, so often betrayed elsewhere, is to deliver such visions as this.
49580|1|De Pauw has one of those soulful, comedically inclined faces that invites instant empathy, and the rest of the cast is likewise well chosen.
78456|0|Interesting idea, lame execution
96385|1|Although We Own the Night is never as suspenseful as it wants to be and can be a little formulaic, it never comes close to being boring, and that's something you can't say too often about movies these days.
67974|1|[Sarandon gives] a brave, complex performance, and the centerpiece of an emotionally searing film.
36502|1|If there's a soft spot in your heart for the sword-&-sandal epic, then you'll swoon with giddy delight over Gladiator.
18989|1|Despite a little dating around the edges this is a truly superb example of its genre and a cinema classic.
6086|1|Searching for Bobby Fischer approaches Josh's fears and self-doubt very effectively and does so with a lot of heart.
62489|1|Successfully [holds] up reality to our ideals, creating a portrait of devastation.
67794|1|The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari illustrates something more eternal: about great manipulators, and the underlying anxiety that either society has gone mad, or we have.
100189|0|Even the most exuberant musical numbers feel either flat or forced.
27069|1|It comes as no surprise that this creature feature isn't remembered as a horror classic.
18767|0|I'm sure that fans of the show were satisfied, but others may find this movie uninvolving and its conspiracy theories juvenile. It's nothing more than a two-hour promotion for the television series that fails to resolve any of the conflicts it introduces.

99892|1|I have no problem signing on to recommend this. Get it? Signing on...John Hancock... nevermind.
97482|0|While not exactly a gift-wrapped present, it's safe to say that Flock will certainly appeal to television cop drama junkies and those who love to see Claire Danes cry, which would now include every film she's ever made.
27604|1|..there is no denying the utter romanticism of the film.
76217|1|Overlooked sci-fi tale. Great fun.

67342|1|A wonderfully entertaining, old-fashioned melodrama of love and war.
31494|1|It's sweet and harmless and very well meaning.

86845|1|First-time director Mark Milgard displays enormous promise and a surprisingly sensitive touch.
34729|0|...glib, well produced, and reasonably well acted, adding up to slick pop drivel.
7193|1|Three great actors. One lovable elephant.
18780|1|Murphy's likeable, the script's laden with a gaggle of one-liners, and there's even a vague message nestling beneath the zoological chaos.
28075|1|It's easy to forget how well Harrison Ford can play an unlikable character.
10386|1|I like The Long Kiss Goodnight. I thought it was a lot of fun, and the dialogue was funny and didn't make me wince in pain.
89368|1|The visuals of Christian Volckman's film blow away just about everything else on the screen this year.
30542|1|Still compelling action sci-fi, due to Weller's character.
98769|1|Treating card playing as an exciting spectator sport rather than, say, about as thrilling as watching fishing for two hours, this offbeat cautionary tale warns all those impulsive casino-bound eggheads out there, that losers come in all IQ's.
43853|1|Calle 54 could make you feel hot, nostalgic and possessive about this music.
91973|1|an impressively noirish moral fable that, for all its bleakness, offers ample rewards to those willing to take a chance on it.
6598|1|The confrontations between Foster and Hopkins -- facing her from an ultrasecure cell -- are models of chilling intensity.
71926|0|Neil Simon's most irritating play is no less agonizing on the screen under Herbert Ross's sycophantic direction.
26526|1|MacKinnon draws terrific performances from all involved (Winslet bravely refusing to court our sympathies), lets character, mood and meaning take precedence over story, and assembles a great music track as a bonus. Spot on.
84858|0|"The words Robert Rodriguez would come to regret saying for years to his son: ""This would make a cool movie""."
80238|1|As usual, Antonioni's pace is langorous, but The Passenger is never less than compelling.
13577|1|While the seemingly endless procession of obscure bands does get a bit wearisome, it does at least mean this isn't the Kurt Cobain-skewed, cash-in feature you might expect.
38180|0|Saturday Night Live had been doing the same thing, only better, on TV for two years prior to this... and Monty Python had been doing something far more subversive and positively genius with their Flying Circus for nearly a decade prior...
40032|0|A loud, stupid and incomprehensible piece of junk
9272|1|The production holds enchantment and delight in substantial quantity.
5125|0|The rap scene has always had its share of colourful characters that are already caricatures. Why is there a need to spoof it?
44460|1|Starring Marilyn Monroe, Betty Grable and Lauren Bacall, Fox's hugely popular hit was the first comedy to be shot in CinemaScope and the second film ever to use this format.
12558|1|A cinematic masterpiece no film fan should miss.
5201|1|Fresh appeals to the head as well as the heart.
5702|0|It would be hard to imagine a film much sourer than Naked, but sourness is not a fault, merely a characteristic. Hollowness, now, self-indulgence, a sort of gloating emotional ugliness -- those are faults.
32295|1|Kirk Douglas is still the champ.
13438|1|Supreme guilty pleasure
76061|1|A good screwball comedy.
10739|1|Although filled with clever twists and double-crosses, the film's storyline is less important than the opportunities it gives the actors to exploit their goofy characterizations.
28995|0|...might have been a first-rate occult thriller if director Koepp had had the confidence to stick with the unearthly side of his tale.
62754|1|It stars Mann's favorite Western leading man James Stewart in an anti-hero role.
99651|0|The thin script (light on length and surprise, heavy on tike-pleasing jokes and action) gives the ancillary anthropomorphized animals so little to say, you'll hardly recognize Angelina Jolie's Tigress or even Jackie Chan's Monkey.
96537|0|A grisly gangster movie with moral pretensions, 10th and Wolf never transcends mobster cliches recycled from The Godfather, Donnie Brasco and GoodFellas.
71249|0|This is, in short, a mystery story that has very little actual mystery.
93511|1|Snaps and crackles with comic verve
87402|1|As young wizard Harry Potter continues to mature, so too does this exciting fantasy franchise.
82021|1|He does, but you probably won't, especially from watching this movie.
36289|1|Told largely from the point of view of the woman, this career-versus-love story still develops the perspective of the man persuasively, as Sanaa Lathan and Omar Epps reveal their characters' motives with nuances of expression that transcend the dialogue.
41645|0|Attempts at quirky humor fall flat and the film settles into a fairly conventional action yarn.
95252|0|As complex as a garden-variety sitcom...
72439|1|Film's high points are the spectaccular aerial stuntwork marking both the pre-credits teaser and extremely dangerous-looking climax.
82211|1|A really well-made film.
79619|1|For once, a true story gets no romanticizing or needless embellishment to become a captivating movie.
74136|1|Newman and Page elevate Williams' melodramatic romance.
13748|1|Another astonishing chapter in the career of the Monster.
78143|1|The best sports movie for years, as it's not about sport at all. Forget fears of jingoistic grandstanding, this is an un-American all-American tale that deserves attention.
63250|1|A [reasonably] compelling, refreshingly non-judgmental look at the newest phase of one-handed clapping.
39001|1|Equally revelatory and entertaining... a fascinating, cathartic, from-the-ground-up reconstruction of an American pariah.
100051|1|Alex Gibney's documentary (aligns) the Gonzo's descent into madness with the decline of American values.
46148|1|"It's a little bit V and a little bit Lethal Weapon. A little bit ""1984"" and a little bit Rambo. It's got sledgehammer political satire, humor, goofiness and little bit of Wrestlemania thrown in to boot."
51137|1|Bertrand Blier's audacious sex comedy won the Best Foreign Language Oscar of 1978.
2954|0|Cute, amusing, but never hilarious.
17470|1|Levinson has created a surprising quickie that satirically strikes out at our political system, the media (easy target) and the whole business of image versus reality.
71892|1|a whacky, racially refreshing breather in Hollywood's white-dominated, politically over-correct bummer of a mainstream culture

38353|0|Most of the performances are stiff, and the awkward dialogue is made even worse by the way in which it is delivered.
26890|0|Despite a vividly expressive performance by Newton, the lack of urgency equates to a lack of intimacy.
72207|0|overblown historical epic

69963|1|The flirtation with incest at the centre of this adaptation of Françoise Sagan's novel is tame by modern standards, but the evil scheming of Seberg as the daughter set on separating her father and his mistress is still forceful.
28850|1|The screenplay effectively communicates the cross-cultural tensions between the Arabs, the Vikings, and the pagan Wendols.
64434|0|It's pretty obvious where director Ronnie Yu's sympathies lie. Still, he can't find a satisfactory resolution to that old teaser about an implacable force vs the immovable object: how to kill off your cash cow and milk her too.
42737|1|There is a high degree of sometimes shocking intelligence running through Reversal of Fortune.
63570|1|This is a very well directed with a good story, great characters, and involving engrossing performances from Charlotte Rampling and Ludivine Sagnier.
21980|0|Hitchcock misses the mark in this latter-day spy thriller. Not one of his best.
72638|1|Two well-deserved Oscars grace this unflinching portrait of selfishness in direct resistance to selflessness.
25789|1|Proves Carpenter's mastery of both mood and the widescreen frame.
7342|1|A hilarious spoof of Trek and Trek fandom. While Galaxy Quest could have easily taken potshots at geeks, rather the film acts as more of a celebration of these sometimes misguided devotees.
89323|1|ATL This is kind of film that sends all the politically correct signals to its target audience, and does it rather well.
101747|1|Not as frightening as it should be, but still better than the average Hollywood scare-a-thon.
54737|1|An evocative exercise in alienation and existential dread, Herzog masterfully tackles one of the greatest gothic stories ever with Nosferatu the Vampyre with the unforgettable (as always) Klaus Kinski as the titular blood-sucker.
87356|1|Well, there goes my dream of driving across Australia.
34267|1|Perhaps the best thing about the film is that the wolves are never made to seem like strange but cuddly dogs. They look like wolves, not especially threatening but still remote and complete unto themselves.
26912|0|Another effort in laziness with scenes lifted directly from earlier Mummy films. Not fun.
51270|1|The film isn't easy to classify-it's a psychodrama that occasionally sharpens into blood-curdling horror-but the experience of watching it is deeply unsettling .
24577|0|Though it takes only 87 minutes to arrive at one of its three different solutions, it has long since worn out its welcome by the denouement.
62684|1|There's no plot as such, just a collection of gags, issues and themes...
9426|1|An excellent film which registers strongly on all levels, whether it's in its breathtaking panoramic shots of the dusty Texas plains; the personal, dramatic impact of the story itself, or the resounding message it has to impart.
36032|1|The film makes wonderfully unsettling entertainment; crucially -- and gloriously -- Bale nails Bateman with a sublimely dead-eyed and deadpan performance.
52123|1|Sacrificing investigations into the mentality behind America's most feared band of outlaws, Hill plumps for an evocation of time and place. He does a magnificent job.
64075|1|Kickboxer 2 is laughable fun. It's got cheesy 80's style motivational music (you know the kind that worked for Rocky), over-the-top action sequences and cardboard thin performances - but all in all it's still a good boys boast.
88563|0|Maybe it's a sign of progress that a mediocre gay romantic comedy can enter the mainstream marketplace and not create any stir.
1213|0|A sour, listless debunking of romantic comedies.
10682|1|So much is suggested, and so little shown.
74285|1|"""...lingers as a sensational fever dream."""
37149|0|The very epitome of giallo; Fulci's masterpiece, but also among the worst films I've ever seen.
17351|1|Tarantino's films aren't so much stories as strings of anecdotes: movie moments, urban myths, conversations strewn with pop culture references.
25268|1|This prom-night balloon of a movie floats easily above the year's other exercises in '50s nostalgia. If you dare reach for it, it will land smartly in your heart.
12312|1|Mr. Branagh's Henry has psychological heft and intellectual weight.
40743|1|Signaled Oliver Stone's transition from iconic commentator to tremulous anarchist.
31555|1|This movie is a living artifact that does what movies do best: exist in time. May this series continue up, up, and beyond.
1506|0|The tone of the acting, which is set by Mr. Grammer's blandly laid-back performance, is all wrong for a genre that demands over-the-top hamming.
40258|1|If you can take Sandler for more than five minutes, this is his funniest film to date.
61548|1|Though the chemistry's a little off in XX/XY, Ruffalo and Wright make it a journey worth taking.

54151|1|... it unapologetically affirms that love can make good things happen in a broken family.

62929|1|Above all a visual achievement, an exuberant use of camera placement and movement and inventive lighting.
26701|1|above the usual mundane coming of age genre films
63107|0|Despite a talented cast, this movie doesn't work.
34294|1|Offering fine, if not the most eye-pleasing, production values and convincing acting, East-West and its important theme deserve attention.
88147|1|The oddest of wartime recruiters, a masterwork of wily drollery
44748|1|A Polaroid sprung to life.
1148|1|Travolta is camp, but the action is cool in true John Woo style.
67738|1|To me, the most enjoyable aspect of WarGames is when David is at work on his computer system. There's something wonderfully nostalgic about watching a guy play with such antiquated machinery and recognize that it was [once] considered state-of-the-art.
61863|0|They must have made an intimidating pair because all during production no one had the courage to tell them that It Runs in the Family stinks.
39653|0|In Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth, Pinhead is definitely the star of the show, but by now the novelty of his evil look and graceful wickedness are wearing a mite thin.
74534|1|While this journalistic jamboree is more flamboyant than probable, a tight and sophisticated script by Casey Robinson and a clutch of professional performances make While the City Sleeps a diverting and workmanlike fiction.
38376|0|Footloose is a seriously confused movie that tries to do three things, and does all of them badly.
8935|1|sharp and jagged... stripped clean
91877|0|If anything this film proves that song can have more impact than a little toe tapping and tub-thumping.
15680|0|A harangue on how ironic it is that men often attack one another verbally and physically as a way to get close.
11469|0|Director O'Haver fails to supply any proper shape or development.
62524|0|The film relies on kinetic energy as its entertainment hook. There is plenty of action, no doubt, but hardly any of it inventive.
52368|1|The Road picture that started it all isn't the funniest, but Hope and Crosby are still fun to watch.
36378|0|One more excruciatingly charmless American indie comedy.
69467|1|Scarlett Johansson, 19, has a matureness beyond her years.
36859|1|Sensational, implausible, irresistible to teens.
359|1|Not -half-bad serial killer thriller. A great cast helps immeasurably.
7226|0|Mindless entertainment for the end of the summer, with emphasis on the mindless.
43971|1|French director Jacques Doillon has a knack for presenting in natural ways the hardships and challenges of youth.
99774|1|Stuck is disturbing in all the right ways, turning an incredible real-life story of human callousness and suffering into a tawdry entertainment that makes guffawing, sociopathic rubbernecks of us all.
52286|1|Pure pleasure.
27481|1|...it's the most fun I have had at any movie thus far in 1999.
85047|0|The material isn't strong enough and the first-time director isn't experienced enough to make it work.
98177|1|Seen through the eyes of a child, this adaptation my lack originality but is fast paced, contains enough fantasy to balance the family drama and is, at times, very scary.
23548|1|An agreeable yet forgettable comedy...
73285|1|The script is tight, the direction is swift and arresting, and the cast is tops -- MGM surrounded its two quipping stars with the best character actors on the lot.
18348|1|If you're a fan of Woody Allen, or jazz music, this film a must-see.
51842|0|This is an incredible story badly told.
33338|0|Little more than a string of comic bits.
1448|1|She may have a screw or two loose, but she's always engaging to listen to
3441|0|Raimi's choice to give the film a comic book-like aura of mingled camp and grit makes for some fitfully energetic and entertaining moments, but it's not enough to overcome The Quick and the Dead's primary fault.
41866|0|"Should be ""so bad it's good."" Isn't."
60456|1|Beginning with the Rorschach-like images of the opening credits, Cronenberg invites us to intuit our own meanings from his weblike design...
18920|1|Smart satirical action-comedy about talking action toys.
31971|1|Benton's personal drama is soulful and utterly absorbing. And yes, we really like Sally Field in this defiant role
32012|0|If only the plot was as sleek.
14166|0|Latest excursion is warmer, wittier, more socially relevant and truer to its TV origins than prior odysseys.

78843|1|An intriguing film made all the more noteworthy due to its nightmare-inducing sequence onboard an alien ship.
19392|1|The movie is locked into a sixties stylistic approach that can feel dated, but Hoffman's performance can prevent one from ever tiring of the film.
9163|0|I don't agree with her much, but Pauline Kael was right about this one.
73408|1|The film is visually stunning, and Peckinpah makes great use of his Durango, Mexico, locations.
11517|0|"""You should not drink and bake"" -- or take this one very seriously"
91531|1|Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera and company prod themselves into a hilariously fascinating exploration, and exploitation, of their own psychological fears. After all, a director like Spike Jonze wouldn't be a hanger-on if there were no subtext.
27460|1|There are moments of absolute magic.
63453|1|Owing to the very same personal urgency that makes it a masterpiece, it is overwhelmingly solipsistic and ultimately alienating.
26757|1|What really makes Night Of The Comet such a joy isn't the nostalgia rush it provides, but the two central characters. These girls just get on with it, dealing with the apocalypse with resourcefulness, crackerjack wit, and machine guns.
67261|0|The film's jokes just aren't that funny.
93372|1|If you like Frank Capra-like movies, then this is for you.
60993|1|O filme pode até não ser uma obra-de-arte, mas está longe de ser o desastre que muitos anunciaram. Ao menos, ele diverte.
6017|0|Directed with composure, but no great fervour, the film's conspicuously uninterested in American football, and much concerned with testing the limits and the resilience of the American dream.
54063|1|Anatole Litvak's taut, gripping, highly stylized noir, based a 22 minute radio play with Agnes Moorehead, is one of the genre's very best, with a bed-ridden Stanwyck in a tour de force performance--a case study for lover of film noir.
97880|0|Even though this raucous, low-low-lowbrow comedy hits theaters early in the year, I'm thinking the race for bottom-feeder of 2008 is, if not over, at least well under way.
37783|1|One of the finest American movies in recent years.
68131|1|A Midnight Clear is a beautifully written, directed and acted movie, but it is so gut-wrenching, so taut, that it is more catharsis than entertainment.
60182|0|Very young children may find the numskull, by-the-numbers gags here amusing, but teens will consider this kids' stuff and adults will be pained.
22984|1|A landmark 1960s counterculture film.
52308|1|The story is gracefully free of contrived story twists and expository dialogue.
10077|1|Sadly, in viewing the film as an adult, I lost a bit of the magic.
44603|0|Historia totalmente intrascendente y sin gracia...
71627|1|Uneven drama that's too intense for kids.
66767|1|The script is whip-smart. The Coens come closer to the zaniness of their greatest comedy, Raising Arizona, then they have in all of their movies since then.
40503|1|The plot is thin, but its bustling construction dazzles.
60598|1|Unusually thoughtful and involving.
84372|1|Completely predictable but affecting nonetheless, proof that when movie clichés are presented with rigor and feeling, they can pack a fresh punch.
16316|0|What ensues is a pageant of special effect set-pieces where innocents are flayed, morphed and disfigured beyond belief and in extreme close-up.
91057|1|Take the kids to see How to Eat Fried Worms, but hold off on forking over the usual princely sum at the concession stand.
88758|0|Perry is a shameless panderer and his movie is cliché-ridden, rudimentary, completely unfocused and about as subtle as a wind-breaking contest in church.
59764|1|'Breathtakingly beautiful and menacingly primitive.'

66079|0|Updated version of the simplistic working class sagas Hollywood used to make in the 1950s (Marty), except that the protag is an ethnic minority female, miscast by the glorious and beautiful Geena Davis; showing promise, Gandolfini may become a lead actor
79766|1|It's richer and more interesting, partly because some motivations have been cleared up, partly because the music isn't a burden and partly because we now can see that this was all leading to the creation of a truly great film four years later.
77723|0|Easily a tune every few minutes, all reliably executed, but the film's insistence on musical comprehensiveness leaves room only for the barest of character development.
44427|1|The script strains credibility at times, and Jonathan Kaplan's direction flags, but with Ray Liotta as everyone's nightmare of a psycho cop, the movie holds us in a vise.

72365|1|In only her third silver-screen appearance, Joanne Woodward found gold -- Oscar gold -- via her Academy Award-winning performance in this psychological drama.
97506|1|Though thematically similar to Dead Man Walking, Longford grapples more directly and thoughtfully with religious themes, and doesn't glorify its eccentric, somewhat tragic protagonist.

11531|1|In spots a very amusing and irreverent tongue-in-cheek satire on class that features a tour de force performance by Peter O'Toole.
12092|1|These days, cartoonish, genre-pastiching movies are everywhere, but Leone's films in this vein are still more enjoyable than most.
27458|0|Perhaps the story is wonderful, but it does not make much sense. Nineteen Hundred remains the same character from beginning to end.
51955|1|In this refreshingly shameless celebration of money and expensive stuff, director Kevin Bray grabs every retro action-film cliché.

18691|1|A truly revolutionary film.

78306|1|One can't deny the dubious appeal of the spectacle of the skin-and-bone Bale, quite possibly endangering his health for the sake of his art.
20568|1|For those of a sentimental turn, there is the delight of watching young Connery romancing the ineffably wholesome Janet Munro, a couple of years before things turned nasty for Commander Bond at Crab Key with the somewhat more knowing Ursula Andress.
55269|1|On the basically farcical level where it chooses to stay, it is a funny and likable movie.
23062|0|An uneven look into a grim future that doesn't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on Philip K. Dick stories.
90965|1|Any movie that lets the Daily Show's Lewis Black, as the school's ad-hoc dean, rant at will about consumerism and foul-mouthed freethinking definitely knows its S.H.I.T. from shinola.

16039|0|A waste of time.
50694|0|Not for the cynical, this is one of those flicks where love happens at first glance and the cad has a heart of gold.
81733|0|A solid, good-looking effort that bends a bit too much toward war-film conventions.
64057|0|You can see why Stickler was drawn to the charismatic Gator, but his story is so extreme (he is serving life for murder) that it effectively unbalances the project.

98256|0|Unfortunately, the outrageousness lessens in the second half of the film, becoming your straight forward underdog movie.
55894|1|Moving and vibrant.
12748|1|An epic movie which is large in scope and personnel, The Bridge on the River Kwai speaks of the code of honour amongst men during war, the respect shared by enemies of war, and the madness which war evokes.
93231|0|In this unwatchable romantic comedy from director Michael Lehmann Diane Keaton plays Daphne Wilder, an inept mother of three pretty but not-believable-as-siblings daughters.
98019|0|I'm not sure I've ever seen rape, incest or abuse dealt with so vapidly.
2461|0|The kids are all standard-issue, pretty cute and functioning as a group rather than individual characters. Likewise the parents.
43294|0|Short on thrills and shorter on political insights
57242|1|The movie has few surprises for lifelong horror fans, but it'll keep them (or us -- I count myself in their number) happily diverted for just under 90 minutes.

68523|1|Great fun for the youngsters among you, but I don't know how much 'sheer determination' us adults can stand at once.
19167|1|Glossy escapist entertainment that's fun to watch but says nothing terribly noteworthy about the human condition.
81664|0|It would be a tour de force in a film with focus, but Spanglish-at its most basic... is all over the... place.

65204|0|...just another monster flick, with most of its budget going into the Creeper's makeup.
53573|0|Grant's puckishness has become overly packaged; what's new about him here is his spiky hairdo. This movie is built on an actor as well as a character who is too intent to be on his best behavior.

4604|1|This movie is so good I moved to Kansas!
9200|1|Grant and Kelly are on sparkling form, as is Jessie Royce Landis as the latter's formidable and smirky mother, and the French Riviera is beautifully captured by the Oscar-winning cinematography of Robert Burks.

72217|0|The battle of Troy takes the jump from history books to film with little consideration, disregarding the story's historical accuracy and failing to entertain audiences with the kind of flashy battle sequences the summer season demands.
40611|1|This rockumentary leaves Vertical Limit and Cliffhanger in the powder snow. The men's versions of the events are fascinating, often amusing and blatantly honest.

50500|1|Losey creates an atmosphere of deepening claustrophobic menace shot through with episodes of savage black humour.
101536|1|The pace never slackens, the prattle is relentless. And in the end I was moved.
55293|1|Among the best Presley features; directed by Don Siegel.
98054|1|The internecine clash depicted between coastal elites and down-home folk goes beyond race to address universal themes about culture and family, so it's more than a guilty pleasure like sweet tea.
57992|1|The immense space -- both vertical and horizontal -- in this film finally seemed enough to contain Fairbanks' sheer gusto.
75994|0|The film offers some laughs - but not big ones.
21235|0|Because it falls in with the undulating rhythm of the life of its heroes, for whom a fatal fight and a quiet night have almost equal importance, the picture never manages to reach the peaks of satisfying Hollywood melodrama.
44088|1|Nifty drama about the life-changing experiences of some middle-aged men at a working dude ranch.
96995|1|700 A.D. is now 21st Century American 3-D. It's a hell of a transformation. The 3-D version of Beowulf -- the one you must see if you see the film -- is a wild roller coaster ride.
15132|1|Instead of heartwarming messages about forgiveness, it honours ambiguity and brings us close, closer than is comfortable, in fact, to what Americans today are really thinking about one another.
55012|1|This delicately observed story, deeply felt and masterfully stylized, is a triumph for its maverick director.
41201|0|The screenplay, by Steven Katz, suffers from arch, almost unspeakably theatrical dialogue, and, as Murnau, John Malkovich recites his lines as if monomania were synonymous with monotonic: He drains the drama of blood.
72584|1|My favourite is the odd cast singing 'The Farmer and the Cowman should be friends', a sentiment I have long believed in.
46306|1|Fox is quite touching here, topped only by Sean Penn in a superb, frightening performance.
71960|1|Coming on a balmy day, with no pretensions of art, Viva Las Vegas, the new Elvia Presley vehicle, is about as pleasant and unimportant as a banana split. And as fetching to look at, it might be added.
30767|0|Viewers have almost two hours to become thoroughly disgusted
44793|1|Guaranteed to inspire a thousand scene replays in pubs on a Friday night.
81008|1|The friskiness of this pas de deux is something, and the acting duet enough of a selling point.
11532|1|The plot is convoluted but director Peter Medak makes some good satirical points about the British class system and Peter O'Toole is terrific in a well-deserved Oscar-nominated performance.
10960|1|The whole movie is white hot, lapped in honeyed golds, evilly blue and black or drenched in those swoony, fiery reds. The Doors blasts your ears and scorches your eyes.
21083|0|The film is not racist, but it stupidly regurgitates the old myth of happy, singing slaves who just love working on massah's plantation.
96042|0|Given its unusual blend of fact and fiction, the film is a real head-scratcher. Like most -- if not all -- of Maddin's films, it's as bewildering as it is visually arresting. And yes, that means it's an acquired taste.
88231|0|If you're a video game geek and/or a stoner, Grandma's Boy isn't a comedy -- it's a documentary. For everyone else, it's an interminably flat, one-joke movie with admittedly a couple of decent laughs.
30757|1|The film does become a fascinating portrait of the talented but mercurial Kinski.
64498|1|A movie that rises to dizzying heights of silliness before soaring into the silly stratosphere, Shaolin Soccer is pure fun.
32034|0|The slim story didn't hold my interest.
51120|1|Otto Preminger has transferred it to the screen with taste and imagination in an opulent production.
81989|0|Azumi (based on a 25-part manga series) has eye-popping battle sequences, but the story is superficial at best.
76124|1|A substantial and affecting piece of work.
55520|0|For all its transparent outrageousness, filmmaker Kurys' tribute to those free spirits is an entertainment for squares.
44432|0|So gay that it's almost possible to see the film as a comment that the real audience for movies like this are pre-sexual little boys and homosexual big boys.
48157|0|If Sidewalks is still a pretty hard film to laugh at, that's not because it stirs horrific memories. The laughs don't come easily because the humor often feels forced.
30100|1|The series' tightest expression of brutes playacting as gentlemen
95511|1|Lightweight fare, but a pleasant outing.
45400|1|Hopkins' whimsical, breezy visual style and light touches carry much of the movie.
47454|1|One of the best horror films of 2001 ...
29754|1|An excellent crime drama in the style of Raymond Chandler, James M. Cain, and Dashiell Hammett.
86530|1|click to read review [Greek]
98086|1|The film's bleak but powerful ending is a wake-up call to Britain and a measure of the pessimism of Loach, one of its most trenchant critics. I fear things must be really bad over there.
64755|0|...unlike [Scorsese's Mean Streets], Ash Wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot.
52916|0|Incoherent prison escape film.
26755|1|A superb apocalyptic tale that's surpassed its decade trappings.
25575|1|Julia Sweeney delivers an extended monologue that's so exquisitely written and so emotionally touching that she manages the near-impossible task of captivating the audience for 85 minutes with quite a demanding material.
90976|1|If nothing else, The Illusionist is worth watching solely for Giamatti's Oscar-caliber performance.
69081|0|"Another psychotic ""thing"" on the prowl, this time IN time for St. Patrick's Day."
43807|1|Sure, it's a shamelessly manipulative film. But it works, because it creates believable, likeable people, and you cry when terrible things happen to people you like.
80212|1|Great aerial stunts, good period atmosphere, and compelling story with Redford in good form.
11737|0|I guess the whole problem is that there's just not enough grifting going on.
37081|1|Unusual Western, with eerie, sinister atmosphere, lots of political commentary, and strange relationships.
56335|1|Jaglom is an acquired taste, but fans and detractors alike will be keen to learn that his latest is less self-referential and less self-reverential than past offerings.
96743|0|Poor Jigsaw. The architect of the most deadly traps ever committed to celluloid has endured inoperable cancer, a debilitating car crash and even the premature death of his son, but nothing as painful or degrading as 'Saw IV.'
89446|0|It's the kind of indie film that makes its mark by a controversial theme, an infamous scene, and dines out on its film-festival buzz.
6248|1|Works in bits and pieces and it's hard to care about the plot very much, but it's all so lovably goofy that it's hard to resist
35107|1|In source novel and film, simplicity, family, and hard work are the pillars.
86962|1|Touching and funny, with an unforgettable ending that could not have been better if it were fiction. One of the best films of the year.
94062|1|Great fun!
57093|0|Weak and dated today, it was one of the first films my family rented after purchasing one of those cutting edge VCRs (you know, the one with the remote control with a cord).
13978|1|Thornton offers a subtle, thoughtful script, generally sensitive direction, and an understated performance, uh-huh.
94039|0|A professional script professionally shot, rather than a personal story burning to be told
61216|1|Cinephiles will lap it up.
22936|0|Bertolucci's grand desert epic gets stuck in the sand right at the start.
52456|0|Amid languorous style, the story gets lost, which is a pity because it could have been a nice quirky one.
57500|1|When I first saw Blackboards three years ago I was surprised as well as puzzled that in some ways it reminded me of John Ford's 1950 western Wagon Master.
81607|1|The finest portrayal of a double-amputee beer baroness outfitted with glass-encased, beer-filled legs that I could imagine.
61567|0|[Verastegui] seems to have confused acting in a motion picture with posing for an 8x10 glossy.

100383|1|As Alfred Hitchcock demonstrated three times, trains make a nifty setting for a thriller.
34746|1|Soft Fruit belongs ... to the divine Ms. Drynan, who plays a dying, unfulfilled, ordinary woman without embellishment or overstatement but with mischievous reserve and surprising sensuality.
82010|0|There are few genuine jokes here, just familiar comic happenings.
73661|1|[I] was awestruck by its bleak, courageous power.
21800|0|Too insubstantial to rise above being anything other than feel-good fluff...
99290|0|I hate Patrick Dempsey!!!
95586|1|Where Dahl succeeds is in transforming two essentially tired characters into fully fleshed-out human beings who fall in love.
67713|1|Violent and very engaging.
2877|0|here's that eviction notice
98085|1|Loach is offering commentary, not solutions, so this one could be the feel-bad film of the week. In the best way, of course.
2151|0|Nothing more than an expanded typical Power Ranger episode ... [But my 6-year-old LOVED it.]
61920|1|It's gratifying and exhilarating enough -- the movie's a foolproof greatest-hits clips package. But Christie is its major coup.
17654|0|If you want a better sci-fi film go see Dark City. A better Levinson movie? Try Wag the Dog.
69811|1|Though it sometimes seems as plodding as its burly protagonist,...an intriguing, if imperfect, piece of work.
78344|1|Lightning in a Bottle is at once deliberate and agile.
44282|1|This may be a date movie with enough quiet charm to appeal to anybody, straight, gay or, like Dean, undecided.
97792|0|Bah! What a lame-o thriller.
51646|0|One of Vincent Price most peculiar films, made in Italy, with poor dubbing of the Italian actors and cheesy special effects
2350|1|Genuinely satisfying feel-good parable about positive thinking and living in the moment.
32427|1|Go see it for yourself. And don't be surprised if you want to see it again and again.
49583|0|Dominique Deruddere's film is at heart all soft and squishy.

60852|0|Grimace-a-ton
76109|1|Quite possibly the weirdest Western ever made by a mainstream studio in the 1950s... I flat-out loved this movie.
46590|1|Ward directs his actors as adroitly as he has written for them, and the vulnerability that he allows his three stars to reveal is really what makes the movie work.
78589|1|hile there is something a little familiar about the use of a journey narrative, and the hint of an uplifting message at the end of the film, the breezy insouciance, gleeful absurdity and wacky innocence of the series remains.
50042|1|It has a sensuality years away from the young faces and trainer-toned bodies we've come to expect.
4603|1|Adaptação impecável do clássico de Capote, é um filme psicologicamente denso, soberbamente montado e dirigido e que traz Blake e Wilson em atuações inesquecíveis.
46597|1|The absurdity of the Indians winning the pennant in 1989 helped make the film a lot of fun, and it was a great little fantasy for Tribe fans back in the day.
42403|1|If When Brendan Met Trudy suffers from anything, it's too much charm.
921|0|The movie's whole virtuous conception of Jean Valjean sticks in my craw. He's haunted and hunted, but he reeks of a reasoned, noble superiority that's a pretty sterile quality in the hero of an epic.
62741|1|Set in a Virginia farm during the Civil War, this popular family film offers all-American star Jimmy Stewart a classic role, a widower with six sons who initially refuses to takes sides or get involved in the conflict--only to learn otherwise.
21613|1|These kids have a bumpy ride, but this is one film that identifies with their passions instead of indulging them, giving us a perfect back-seat view of kids out cruising, not for kicks but for a hard-earned sense of pride.
21561|0|For all its state-of-the-art animation techniques, Spielberg's production remains resolutely conservative: visually it's virtually indistinguishable from Walt at his wimpiest.
47467|1|For a while there, the film has us going.
93751|0|There is an utter lack of visual energy at every turn, like every single take in the final cut was the last shot on that day of shooting.
95524|0|(O)ther than the reprehensible glorification of teenage sexual promiscuity, this is a meaningless, forgettable film that is relatively entertaining...
81451|0|The gripping material is given short thrift in favor of routine melodrama and a love story that has nearly nothing to do with what should be the crux of the story.
96465|1|I wish someone had lost this script in the fire.
101940|1|This film entertained me throughout, but it also provided me with a truly insightful look at the amoral world of trading man-killers.

21619|0|Unfortunately she gets straitjacketed in her current movie by a script that settles for black-and-white pronouncements instead of the delicate shades of gray that Ringwald employs.
2961|0|I've seen better movies, but I've certainly seen worse.
29218|1|American Splendor is certainly one of the most complete, satisfying and entertaining hybrid of documentary and dramatisation, as well as of live action and 2D animation/comic stills.
11943|1|Brazil is this unique amalgamation of ideas straight out of Terry Gilliam's head that results in something so strange and so unique that it's just genius with a conclusion that is undeniably haunting.
67885|0|Feels more like a brainstorm exercise than a feature length film.
62824|1|Visually spectacular early sound Western
1747|1|One of the most acclaimed and accessible masterworks of surrealist cinema, an erotic meditaton about reality and fantasy that remains alluring and shocking decades after it was made, at least partly due to Catherine Deneuve's cool, mesmerizing performance

46888|0|...a thoroughly trashy piece of work...
94518|0|But Lucky You would be distinctly better if it were shorter in length and clearer about the rules of the game. Its idea that gamblers carry on much the same in life as they do at the tables is hardly original enough to sustain the whole film.

57974|0|Not much sparkle.
56773|1|Well, it's no Part VI, but then it's no Jason X either.

83434|0|...a promising thriller that slowly-but-surely wears out its welcome.

98740|0|With all the nurses making moves on the suicidal old codger's renovated physique, Coppola's Youth Without Youth comes across as somewhere between The Godfather On Viagra and Apocalypse Then, Redux.
45975|0|A pathetic comedy where the highlight is an inside joke that Richard Pryor's character flips the bird with the wrong finger.

100811|1|Sure, there are some moments when the plot falls right down a gun barrel, the comedy is too over the top and the jokes are downright gross. Still, in comparison to the other slapstick comedies this year, this movie-within-a-movie strikes above the rest.

68078|1|"Plenty of strikes against this--moronic story line, obligatory animal mugging, more ""awwwww"" opportunities than any film since 3 Men and a Cradle--but it's still one of the most accomplished pulp fantasies in a while."
50441|1|Hallström ... has done a spectacular job with this odd story, and has created a memorable, if not perfect film.
74593|1|Worth it for pairing of Garbo and Gilbert alone.
36497|0|Rather than getting lost in the world Scott has created on screen, Scott asks filmgoers to marvel at how he created that world, and how smoothly he succeeds in manipulating us.
8917|1|Arguably the best detective movie ever made in Hollywood.
23460|1|"American History X advocates that ""those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it""? It's a powerful social document and should be part of your film watching curriculum."
1237|1|Superior disposable comedy.
57386|0|Disappointingly conventional, particularly given Taymor's past work on stage and screen.
5701|1|There are also moments of tenderness, necessary chinks of compassion spearing the murk. It's also bitingly, appallingly funny. And it's a masterpiece.
10769|1|All time classic in writing, Mancini music, and great stars.
22670|0|A thin, cynical calculation.
28578|0|The computer animation of the monsters here is a herky-jerky cartoon blur that is anything but scary.
86864|0|You're in deep.
91196|1|Loach delivers a moving and often beautiful story that captures the essence of the conflict, with all its unintended consequences and personal tragedies.
82966|0|Summer Storm is another of those soft-core, simple-minded stories about a geeky young gay man (Robert Stadlober as Tobi) struggling with his sexuality over the course of a long, hot, sexed-up summer.
63285|1|One of the best of the director's late silent epics.
86664|1|Wim Wenders y Sam Shepard (Paris, Texas) recuperan (en excelente fotografía y mejor música) una iconografía norteamericana al servicio de una historia sobre el desarraigo y la necesidad de recuperar vínculos largamente perdidos.
24820|0|It's merely a soap opera with elevated production values and a sterling cast.
82896|1|... filled with clever zingers on the American Dream.
45886|0|Johnny be worthless.
94601|0|Narrative incoherence continues to reign supreme.
99619|1|It raises big, intriguing questions that rarely, if ever, come up in the hubbub about steroid use in professional athletics, particularly Major League Baseball.
5601|1|A dishearteningly jingoistic thriller, saved by sharp action scenes and a few decent surprises.
23474|0|The problem is that Kaye, who's used to selling cars on TV, shoots Derek the Hater as lovingly as he would a new Volkswagen.
67799|1|Warped in all senses, fascinating and bizarre ...
25964|0|The bluntest, cheapest and worst of the 'Apes' movies.
42729|1|Director Schroeder takes the 'did-he didn't-he' conundrum surrounding Claus von Bülow and makes it the film's greatest virtue, with Irons mesmerising.
54765|1|Typical Raquel Welch bounce and leer action from her heydey.
33346|1|It lives on borrowed time, but makes the most of it.
88631|0|There are few words to describe the awfulness of this movie, but let's give it the old college try: dismal, depressing, embarrassing and utterly lacking in any artistic or social worth.
8496|1|We're all ghosts in Tsai's world, though we may not all know it.
100084|0|Over-hyped.
86086|1|Soft in the middle, and none of Cho's stories here take on an epic scope....[Yet] the comedienne remains endearingly naughty.
45321|0|I never stopped marveling at the thousands of individually delineated pores and hair strands of the heroine, but the thin story covering her acquisition of one wave after another while narrowly escaping death time and again is strictly for player one.
55591|0|The only thing the lowly Hills 2 has going for it is the grossness, ferocity, and superhuman strength of the rampaging mutants. I mean, these guys put the ugh in ugly; they make the original's Michael Berryman look like a hunk.
31292|0|A very vulgar pro-faith comedy rather than a sacrilegious goof, Dogma is an extraordinarily uneven film that significant cutting might be able to transform into a playable one.
47710|0|This transferral of the tragedy of the Moor to a contempo American high school is something that never should have gone further than a class assignment to see if it could be made to work.
87237|1|What makes it intriguing and eminently watchable is Considine's deft almost low-key portrayal of what is essentially an avenging angel.
65971|1|... Videodrome is as contemporary and relevant as ever.
32217|1|"If you've got some time to kill and have seen everything else, put this on your list."""
56670|1|It's just an honest, funny, touching story about a teen-age girl who tries to find her way after graduating high school.
92986|0|The subplot turns what might have been a fascinating true-life adventure into a lurid, stereotypical melodrama.
102498|1|One of the best half-movies of the year.
60008|0|"If you hear the phrase ""Italian caveman epic"" and your heart doesn't sing at least a little bit, then I pity your sad and joyless existence."
8324|1|The dialogue and characters are convincing and intelligently developed. Russo wears vulnerability and neediness like a second skin, while Costner plays the tragic hero with considerable charm.
28780|0|This rude knockoff of Donnie Brasco has little of the raw, forlorn humanity that made that film a standout.
63599|0|Worth catching for the photography and for Làzaro Ramos' performance.
11586|1|Characteristically and welcomingly Tim Robbins
49576|1|Not even in the same galaxy as Neil Simon's best work, but fans of the genre will appreciate the gags.
72537|1|Summertime was shot exclusively in Venice. And for those who have been to Venice, the film is a rare treasure;
92159|0|Russell Crowe has many talents, but a gift for light comedy is not one of them.
53048|1|The complex, demanding script tries to cover too many bases at once, but it succeeds better than one might expect.
81389|0|Hafström's dramatic sense is ... pedestrian and snail's-pace obvious.
62511|0|...has half the racing scenes, twice the plot and none of the Vin Diesel.
71569|1|It would be quite impossible to claim is that the filmmaker's love of his subject isn't apparent throughout every lovingly-crafted frame.
70541|0|A lesser entry in the '90s genre of talky, Tarantino-and-Linklater-inspired Gen-X babblefests
90458|0|This plays like a 'Season One' DVD, silly moments interspersed with lots of dull plot and lame high-school send-up situations.
44676|0|The arc of their romance ... has nothing in the way of surprises or quirks to lift it out of the ordinary.
83979|1|Highly amusing.
50328|0|Those hoping for some insights into the state of the world had best look elsewhere.
56713|1|The year 2002 has conjured up more coming-of-age stories than seem possible, but Take Care of My Cat emerges as the very best of them.
71090|1|It's the kind of seriously offensive in-your-face psychological thriller that would make a hell of a double-feature with Dreyer's Day of Wrath.
48861|1|Normal people should probably stay away, but twisted people and young filmmakers will find laughter, inspiration and joy here.
955|1|Nico Icon tells us more than we ever knew about this pop star yet manages to leave the mysterious reflecting pool that will forever be Nico intact.
36783|1|Stunning, but can be dark and scary in places.
36764|0|The 16th Elvis movie looks good thanks to cinematographer Lucien Ballard.
12993|1|There is unlikely to be a better movie from the States or anywhere else this year.
100232|0|Although talented newcomer Christine Horne is ideal as the younger Hagar, letting Burstyn play the character at around 50, despite best-effort lighting, was not the wisest choice.
102413|1|It's Langella that steals the show. Sometimes bordering on imitation, Langella overcomes that by injecting Nixon with a biting wit and complete dedication to a highly public figure.
9009|1|"Sunset Boulevard's entire point of view is based on a gimmick. Whether one considers it an ""artistic cheat"" or a valid and audacious device depends up his ability and desire to suspend his disbelief."
18332|1|There isn't really a big laugh in the bunch, but the comedy does manage to keep its balance, barely, thanks to an efficient pace and light disposition.
2977|0|It doesn't bog down in the bogs, but it's slow-moving just about everyplace else.
76866|1|An enjoyable, high-energy romp.
76878|1|Style doesn't trump substance in Johnny To's quickie circus act PTU because the style is the substance.
56902|1|Seldom has a comedy about such thoroughly dumb individuals been so engaging, or so insightful.
15032|1|A classy piece of work that may disappoint those looking for something more conventional.
65481|1|A witty, extravagantly picturesque homage to Sergio Leone.
38518|1|simultaneously plays by and punctures the expectations of the courtroom thriller
8844|1|Beautifully written and directed by the great Billy Wilder, bittersweet and heartfelt, this is sheer delight.
40740|0|This is a sad case of a film with high and noble intentions that features great dramatic performances, but it ends up being a superficial epic, diluted, limited, and strangely unmoving.
49060|0|This one tastes like a sour apple I had on a blind date many eons ago.
58925|1|The movie's edges are filled with small, perfect character performances.
21021|1|A beautifully directed, high-flyin' production, teeming with all sorts of classic Hollywood encounters and bizarre comic book touches...Connelly is mesmerizing -- a stupendous act of casting that elevates the room temperature of the picture.
62948|0|Few people can be so big-hearted as to tolerate Ed's agonizing brand of pedantic humour.
857|1|A deliriously trashy, exuberantly vulgar, lavishly appointed exploitation picture, this weird combo of road-kill movie and martial-arts vampire gorefest is made to order for the stimulation of teenage boys.
88496|1|The kids will love the candy-box sets and costumes like confectionery-shop windows, the whimsy and farcical grotesqueness of it all.
83611|0|If you only watch a scene or two on the internet, it's hilarious. Watch it all and it's a little tiresome and unconvincing.
35613|1|Bates turns Wilkes into the nastiest nurse to reach the screen since Louise Fletcher tormented Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.
24865|1|This satisfying film reveals the ways in which a village can successfully raise a child.
86824|1|While The Gospel's faith-laced dialogue might annoy non-Christians, the plot mostly explores themes of a universal nature. Recommended to members of any faith for the stirring, onscreen performance of Grammy-winner Yolanda Adams.
54156|1|It's not in the same league with the likes of Beauty And The Beast or Aladdin, but it's much better than, say, last year's Atlantis: The Lost Empire.
8282|0|Stupid, bloody excuse for gore, nothing more.
7467|1|A showcase tailor-made for Keaton and his maniacally comedic persona(e).
56895|1|A well-crafted Hitchcockian-style thriller with De Palma again in top form. It's a mystery why this fizzled at the box office in the summer of 1981.
34764|1|This unexpected delight, which travels at top speed from the doldrums to the Grand Canyon, is moreover blessed with two high-octane performances.
72808|1|Dripping with sentiment, but who cares when you've got Bergman as the singing nun?

5191|0|Glibly shocking, it would like you to think it deals with the hard realities of urban life, but in fact it uses its patina of social consciousness as a come-on for the most conventional kind of violent commercial filmmaking.
59244|1|A fun film.
6683|0|"Maybe ""Farewell to the Franchise"" would have been a more appropriate title - this retread of the very scary original is a mildly hilarious mess."
38617|1|There's so much more to this movie than the storyline. Tampopo is a manic celebration of pleasure in every imaginable form, from the gustatory to the carnal.
28290|0|The movie wears its social responsibility with pride, even if it doesn't always know how to put together a coherent public service announcement.
4863|1|Few modern-day movies are more genuinely frightening.
77532|0|Bernie Mac has a talent for cussing. It's a talent that can take you pretty far in the entertainment industry, but it still can't carry a movie, as Mr. 3000 demonstrates.
94764|0|Hubiera sido una estupenda comedia negra si no fuera que el director Bruce A. Evans se tomó el asunto en serio. Firme candidata a la peor película del año.
14845|1|A dark, effective satire about drug addiction that offers laughs as well as savage criticism of the US approach to dealing with users.
2307|0|Something to Talk About never goes bad, though it does get corny in places, and it hits a couple of dull patches near the finish.
17983|1|The finest, strangest and most uncompromising western to hit screens since Unforgiven.
65310|0|Badly acted and, running well over two hours, often mind-numbingly ponderous.
45517|1|As vastly expensive pieces of set tumble everywhere one cannot help but consider that white elephants, whilst they mat be a burden to keep, are splendid things to look at.
10409|0|Ranges in quality from adolescent boys' adventure stories to Heart of Darkness.
6014|1|Sean Astin is utterly winning...
9584|1|One of Wayne's top B efforts; an offbeat love story that works as a romance as well as a Western. Russell is luminous.
54664|0|Despite yet another endearingly eccentric turn by Christopher Walken, this is as bad as anyone could possibly imagine.
18467|0|Violent updated classic could be too intense for young kids.
100318|0|It'd all be tres dull if it weren't for the magnificent faces of Pauline Acquart and Adele Haenel. Actually, it still gets dull, even if at times the film skirts kiddie-porn territory.
75674|1|A finely made drama about a seriously disturbed family.
17633|0|Called on to replace some of his Happy Gilmore shtick with the emoting of a romantic lead, he does just that but in an unpersuasive on/off fashion.
25203|1|I thought this was crazy fun, minus the metal music.
67555|1|In the annals of movie profanity, this movie would rate an Oscar, but it's actually pretty sweet at heart, although never sentimental. And if you don't believe me, you know what you can do.
96382|0|Gray assumes rather than dramatizes the depths of his characters, scanning for gravitas where there are only rickety clichés
1589|0|"Not just horrid by itself, this opened the floodgates for all those self-absorbed indie ""relationship"" comedies of the latter 1990s."
68798|1|Anyone who has anguished over whether to put on Bartok or Oscar Peterson to impress visitors should check this one out . . .
51575|0|It's mainly an excuse for director Michael Rymer to unleash his arsenal of flashy, MTV-type visuals and Moulin Rouge costume designer Angus Strathie to play dress-up.
82410|0|A bad movie, but I've seen much worse.
6105|1|It is, first and foremost, a visual delight, a Victorian picture book come to life, from its brief prologue in India through its darkly enchanted recreation of Misselthwaite Manor on the Yorkshire moors.
50922|1|While Wang Xiaoshuai's film doesn't plumb the depths, nor resonate with the kind of profound irony of Vittoria De Sica's 1947 classic, it is nonetheless an affecting, poignant drama.
38583|0|Really dated, but clever concept.
20206|1|The future never looked as retro...
101971|1|Perfect off-season timing for a wickedly off-kilter movie about a French family Christmas in extremis.
77396|0|Shot in black-and-white in an attempt to evoke the sophisticated burr of '40s films, its intent is hamstrung by over-familiar gags, though the script comes more to life when Prince and Benton lapse into black street talk.
26082|0|Seems just to skim over the story... without ever delving into its depths.
43374|1|Rivetingly grotesque!
85862|0|An ethically repugnant, relentlessly monotonous chamber drama that manages the difficult trick of boring and irritating its viewers simultaneously.
100959|1|Bottom line: The party's over. There's no such thing as a free lunch. America itself may be a bubble.
100296|1|It's a shame that the story itself feels like smoke and mirrors with nowhere to go, wanting to have its cake and eat it too.
102125|1|Unfortunately, between its predictably and the absence of chemistry between Kidman and Jackman, Australia amounts to little more than an amusing if just as readily-forgettable diversion.
19643|1|The punk/sci-fi film to beat.
67538|1|No matter how you look at this film, it is a chilling look at what makes us tick at our very basic nature.
68741|1|Classic feminist film
50285|0|Despite the curiosity it inspires, the world's first X-rated cartoon falls flat in its first ten minutes.
78715|1|Another stunning martial arts masterpiece from Yimou Zhang.
36860|0|De Palma has a choppy, episodic sense of story, and he crafts individual scenes rather than telling a single unified story.
87468|1|Favreau keeps things moving fairly frenetically, clearly having fun with the general mayhem
39134|1|Fine version of the story with Hepburn as a fascinating monster.
45701|1|"""Gremlins on Acid"" - as wacky as it is wicked, loads of fun"
81340|0|All told, Bright Young Things is one of the most depressing obliterations of a literary source that comes to mind.
66309|1|Wilson, obsessed with the Alpha male art of Hemingway and Melville, is portrayed as a man driven by society's outsized notions of XY-dom.
30531|1|As the years pass, RoboCop seems more prescient than ever.
72308|1|It's knowing about the killing, and waiting for it to happen on the screen that gives the film its energy and thrust.
87800|0|I can't deny the incidental pleasures of watching these talented players giving it their all, even in such a misguided project.
54790|0|At a running time of just under two full hours, the boredom becomes as exaggerated as the wallpaper.
98546|1|The sort of somber, minimalist drama that can only be found in the cinema of the late 1960s and early '70s.
16841|1|The flashy style cannot hide the slight story.
29825|1|Ted Post's direction is especially adroit at keeping the baroque flurries bubbling under the deceptive surface of old-pro craftsmanship
10811|0|A lumbering behemoth of 160 minutes of overproduced, overbearing overkill.
56692|0|What is shown is ultimately less captivating than the manner in which it is shown.
41570|1|This lickety-split action comedy is distinguished by the wry, character-conscious direction of Martin Brest, who coaxes a silver-bullet performance from star Eddie Murphy that's practically criminal in its accuracy.
77984|1|"Geniuses of satire Matt Stone and Trey Parker bring more laughs to the big screen after their wildly funny 1999 movie ""South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut"" with a cast of square-jawed marionettes fighting terror by way of North Korea's Kim Jong II in a re"
42330|1|A relaxed and entertaining drama that revolves around the nurturing qualities of the ultimate earth mother.
55830|1|Because of the battle scenes, this film will likely appeal primarily to men, though anyone whose primary interest is cinematography should also see it.
11490|1|Almost too concentrated on Ali, but the story plays well with an exhilarating pace and plenty of well-remembered expositional details.
42753|0|If these guys are so smart, why do they win their final victory with nothing more subtle than a punch in the mouth, backed up by a military tank?
37618|1|A riotous spoof of TV soap operas and the people who create them, the clever foundation being that the backstage lives of the principles are more sudsy than the TV program they work on.
17474|1|Very relevant not only for 1990s, but also for generations to come.
86289|0|The 15-year-old MTV cartoon on which it is based must be better than this.
97002|1|So much is right about Beowulf that one longs for the darker, grimier version that might have been in live action.
96636|1|A wobbly construction of facts, but as musical bio-pics go, it has real cinematic personality and avoids most of the painful clichés that tend to shadow these productions...you can sense Deborah's script-approval fingerprints all over the material.
37661|1|We all know who's going to pair off with whom in the end, but Branagh does get us there in some considerable style.
100977|1|It makes a very good effort at trying to cover this enormous, important, complex issue of the national debt in less than an hour and a half.
24175|0|If only Jaime Pressly got naked...
26575|0|The film doesn't know whether to take itself seriously or play it for laughs.
53309|1|One of [Woody Allen's] greatest films.
5265|0|It can't decide whether to be a mushy valentine to the dad-son relationship, masculine style, or a not-very-clever comedy.
69141|0|Watching the film is like listening to someone use a lot of impressive words, the meanings of which are just wrong enough to keep you in a state of total confusion, but occasionally right enough to hold your attention. What is he trying to say?
25276|1|"Nicolas Cage lets the comedy rip. ""You mean my wang?"""
73861|1|A smaller work in Allen's stable
39185|0|The effects are dull and the film tends to drag.
77690|1|The pasty, scruffy Pegg shows a surprising amount of range for the unlikely hero of a zombie flick.
77183|0|Reese Witherspoon is miscast in this poor adaptation of the popular novel.
27869|1|Rare is the terrible film that's this upbeat and delightful and entertaining.
48387|1|"An anti-musical...based on The Who's 1973 ""rock opera"" concept album...all the more brilliant for this seemingly counter-intuitive approach. [Blu-ray]"
43125|1|This one has its moments.
68993|1|Unjustly lambasted comic insanity.
53914|1|...puts the snap, crackle and pop back into the spy thriller.
81001|1|From its opening frame to its final revelation, Interview hums with life.
23250|1|This is a tale of redemption and transcendence, of the hunchback of London Hospital, of the noble phantom who wanted to go to the opera, of Beauty and the Beast.
33558|1|Well-mounted and very traditional, Of Mice and Men honorably serves John Steinbeck's classic story of two Depression-era drifters without bringing anything new to it.
68378|1|Twelve Brechtian tableaux chronicle the life and death of a whore, starting out as a documentary on prostitution, ending as a Monogram B movie.
25545|0|That's a relatively clever set-up for what's become a familiar genre: the time-displacement comedy, in which we get a kick out of viewing our era through another era's eyes. But this movie's eyes, Adam's, are awfully twinkly and not too focused.
47882|0|A small film whose virtues are probably best appreciated on tape.
83555|0|Gilles and Marion may be more than the sum of their regrets, but because their creator hasn't done the math, they remain touching stick figures.
45411|1|The same offbeat sensibility that informed Swingers is also evident here, except that unlike the 1996 film, which dealt with real issues, Favreau's new crime-comedy is plotless
32561|1|A meathead burlesque.
84476|0|All these plots converge in a decidedly unfunny cacophony.
97414|1|Just may be the best film of 2007 that you've probably never heard of.
42703|0|So-so pro military recruitment movie with some thrills/
68467|1|Another winner for the Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers combo. It's smart, modern, and impressive in every respect, from its boy-loses-girl background to its tunefulness, dancipation, production quality and general high standards.
95026|0|The problem for Tarantino in Death Proof is that the girl talk that occupies so much of the running time is anything but true to the culture 50 years ago. The setting is contempo, but the movie style is period
82847|1|At the time, the real-life Flanagan complained that MGM made Boys Town look so neat, clean, and well managed that he had trouble raising money for the center
43774|1|Norma Rae is a seriously concerned contemporary drama, illuminated by some very good performances and one, Miss Field's, that is spectacular.
53832|0|Brandon Lee may want to follow in his father's kick-steps, but unlike martial arts legend Bruce Lee, he's far too pretty for the job.
39783|1|James Whale's 1933 film plays more like a British folk comedy than a horror movie; it's full of the same deft character twists that made his Bride of Frankenstein a classic.
47292|1|...a surplus of good, hummable tunes, breezy dialogue and characterizations, beautiful location shots, and excellent DVD transfer.
47562|0|Hollywood monstrosities all, and boy are they scary!
91577|1|The cinematography and creature effects are terrific, while the subtitles never get in the way of the story which follows young girl Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) into a nether world which will test her to the limit with a series of dangerous tasks.
30861|1|Grim but compelling tale set in a Depression era dance marathon. Gig Young deservedly copped the Oscar.
29634|1|In the higher middle of producer Lorne Michaels' cinematic oeuvre.
101698|1|Kinnear is outstanding as Kearns, physically conveying the stubborn, scruffy sense of resolute ethics that drives him at the expense of almost everything else.
65011|1|Christian Bale is utterly sympathetic and engaging as Bobby. He convincingly communicates both the simplicity and chaos of his character's personality and gives the film a strong emotional core.
90685|1|That most wonderful of films, the kind that works on every level, but can't be easily pigeonholed.
90534|1|full review in Greek
30673|1|City Lights gets to the heart of the Tramp. It is a beautiful romance about loving someone for who they are and not their social or economic status - and it features one of the most tear inducing and iconic endings in Hollywood history.
99684|0|A splendid cast mostly just sits around watching the bad news on television, dutiful to the letter of Danny Strong's conscientious script yet insufficiently roused to righteous spirit even as, before their eyes, our republic gets banana'd.
89125|0|Their acceptance of the tango and foxtrot never seems like much of a dance dance revolution; if you're looking for more than just impressive dancing, well, you got served.
4568|0|Overcooked and half-baked.
78594|1|Even when it misses the mark, SpongeBob drips with originality.
93501|0|Its barely sketched, improvised skits deliver very few laughs.
21507|1|Artful, pretty forgotten (and it should not be) animation of best seller.
86647|1|Wryly funny and understated and surprisingly easy to watch.
96509|0|I wouldn't be surprised if the football player Tom Brady is actually a better filmmaker than the filmmaker Tom Brady.
33137|0|"It's not good when you check your watch every 20 minutes during a 107-minute movie. It's bad when you think, ""Yeaahh, rrright"" almost as often."
64502|0|Fanning practically dares the audience to throw sharp objects at the screen with her thoroughly obnoxious performance.
17810|0|Alongside previous men in the iron mask, the '98 contender doesn't amount to much.
1062|0|There are plenty of decent laughs, but the shadow of the far superior British zombie romcom looms large.
42887|1|we are all part of planet Earth, and Sitch's film reminds us without preaching
11909|1|The Empire may not top Star Wars, but it certainly makes one look forward to whatever new surprises George Lucas and his band of cinematic wizards can conjure up for us.
13417|1|Ben Kingsley's title performance is amazing, particularly in the way he ages across the five decades which the film depicts.
71166|1|A nicely unsentimental look at modern relationships, The Last Kiss suffers a bit from haphazardness in its construction, but holds up through a strong cast and solid writing.
59567|1|In the end, I'm left with an immeasurable appreciation for how bloody hard 1st A.D.'s work on set, and the crap they've got to deal with.
72950|1|A portrait of a tranquil Vietnam unknown to most Westerners . . . a lyrical and magical movie-masterpiece.
92943|0|"Annoying, blank, and bereft of any narrative arc ""Old Joy"" has nothing familiar or enchanting to recommend it."
57318|1|All Or Nothing may seem depressing, but in fact uplifts us.
77776|1|Fans know exactly what they're in for. But make sure you see the Part 1 first ... it's a whole lot better.
74676|0|For Prince fans, this movie will be a must for videocassette purchase, but even they will have to deal with the sexist way women are treated by all the film's male characters.
19396|1|Great performances from Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman cap this bravest Academy Awards Best Picture choice in history.
12043|1|Peck's performance, in tortoiseshell glasses and a cream linen suit, is mesmerizing and serious.
51065|0|A disposable film.
71760|1|Seen nowadays it is a kitschy, retro scream. Yet as dinosaurs and giant sea-turtles roam the volcanic earth in One Million Years BC, this is also a chance to appreciate the early work of the great special effects pioneer Ray Harryhausen.
34125|1|turns out to be less interested in the cartoonish brutality of pro wrestling than it is with the lives of the people who make their living in the ring.
99361|0|Beautifully shot, but ultimately dull and plot-free drama that's both elusive and frustrating, despite a strong performance from Binoche.
46251|0|A painfully inept comedy.
99493|1|A breezy diary from a pair of first-time farmers, as well as a wry rebuke to a nation devoted to eating cheaply but not necessarily well, King Corn makes its points without much finger-wagging.
7315|1|The limits of redemption and forgiveness get challenged ruthlessly in this haunting drama...
51273|1|It's a ghost story; it's a meditation on time, memory and the poignancy of married love. And it's a masterpiece.
99540|1|The astonishing feat of the documentary Lake of Fire is that it takes a topic about which everyone is always telling us what to think and manages to do justice to both sides. Or rather, all sides.
47691|0|One of those horror movies in which its characters do such unbelievably stupid things all the time that you literally want to shout at them.
40819|1|Nothing in the story is unpredictable, but watching these events unfold is as delightful as when your mom told you your favorite story for the 100th time.
26615|1|Fans may find certain similarities between eXistenZ and Videodrome bothersome, but both films are the real thing.
13875|1|... a slick, polished, and professional thriller that combines an intriguing mystery with periodic eruptions of bloody violence ...
35174|0|It's not Shakespeare a la Kenneth Branagh, but it's not bad either.
95582|0|Bad even by the low standards of its genre.
101226|0|Russell Gewirtz's script is built around a trick, one that is simultaneously too clever by half and not clever at all (which itself is quite a trick).
79741|1|Still a classic after the wretched remake, Price's horror film is still fun, even during the cheesy climax.
28817|1|Inoffensive jungle flick. Connery's wicked hair weave took home Best Supporting Actor.
8914|0|Nothing short of an invasion could add much to Casablanca.
36126|1|Diner is often a very funny movie, although I laughed most freely not at the sexual pranks but at the movie's accurate ear, as it reproduced dialogue with great comic accuracy.
5954|0|This painfully unfunny spoof rivals Dracula: Dead and Loving It as Brooks' worst film.
14943|1|Although not destined for greatness, there are some appealing elements about this irreverent comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously; bizarre characters, off-the-wall concepts and absurdly funny lines.
38713|0|"""Hollow Man"" trots out Verhoeven's usual bag of tricks, including voyeurism, considerable violence against women and having the characters use about four times as much profanity as they would in real life."
26310|1|A great-looking picture that zips along with grace, light on its feet but possessed of just enough gravity to allow us to take its people rather than its old TV series premise seriously.
99368|0|Lamorisse's film was a third of this length, and was lighter than air. Hou's is about the weight of air itself on a muggy day, and whether that sustains over 113 minutes will be between each viewer and his attention span.
35524|0|A dark, stupid tale.
1027|0|Dead Poets Society goes to the high seas in this overly ambitious tale of 13 young men aboard a floating prep school vessel. Their rite of passage is the core element in this all-spit and no-polish production.
85196|1|July's suspiciously contrived awkwardness notwithstanding, the picture is at its best when it cleaves to her experimental video aesthetic; framing the mundane with the wonder of a child-like perspective.
31266|1|Vanessa Williams adds marquee value as a police negotiator.
93466|0|This is Barrymore's burden, that she consistently resists generic business even as she makes it tolerable. The next step is to challenge the business outright.
98200|1|Inexplicably, I liked this film more than its predecessor. Wait - let me type that again, just to let the reality sink into my own mind: I actually liked Step Up 2.
40251|1|A picture of exquisite ambience.
61164|0|There's nothing wrong with this movie, it just kind of moves along at this little pace, no surprises.
79231|0|This rather silly follow-up to Cat People isn't so much unwatchable as it is merely unnecessary.
3790|0|Soderbergh is a talent, but he still hasn't found his groove. He seems to be searching for the project that will be a match for his talents. He needs to keep looking.
85828|0|Kimberly warns that 'every war has its casualties' - you pick a fight with her and you're gonna be on that 'notify my next of kin' list... wickedly funny.
80739|1|Every shot is perfectly composed and compelling, with light and shadow manipulated to maximum effect.
94166|0|...a movie with its heart in the right place and its computers heading off in all different directions.
93257|0|It's small consolation when you have to sit through such a miserably unfunny movie, but at least the bad ideas here are relatively original.
26261|1|There's good on-screen chemistry, good acting, and an incredibly well written and clever ending.
37531|1|An astonishing display of virtuoso cinema that is destined to take its place among the most vivid and freshly imagined fist-to-groin contests in the medium's history.
92352|1|Certainly food for thought then, just a shame the characters aren't as fully-fleshed.
7703|0|Someone deserves a timeout for letting this mawkish misfire get to the screen.
67187|1|John Rawlins, normally a minor director, did a smashing job in framing the story with moody noir-style cinematography.
101799|1|As ever with Ritchie, RocknRolla is more flash than substance, but beneath the swagger his movie scratches away at British anxieties.
35139|1|The traumatic subject matter of a child custody fight is handled with restraint and intelligence in The Good Mother.
47923|1|Simultaneously alienating and weirdly compelling, Barbet Schroeder's Our Lady of the Assassins isn't a comfortable ride
58587|1|Great work by Jack Nicholson in the title role plus Kathy Bates, Hope Davis and Dermot Mulroney at the tempered hand of writer/director Alexander Payne.
37197|1|This is one of the best science-fiction films ever to come from Britain.
97680|1|This short, stripped-down, first-person horror picture delivers some brutally effective shocks and gradually conjures a haunting atmosphere of ever-escalating panic and despair.
98124|1|I Live in Fear shows that Kurosawa is far from content with humanity, but that doesn't mean he's given up hope entirely.
17404|0|A lousy movie without a single laugh.
89300|1|A scathing indictment of the MPAA.
25385|0|The happy-go-lucky Three Amigos is a picture to see when your expectations are down and you've already been to everything that's good.
72595|0|...ugly, unedifying exploitation cinema.
64551|0|A feel-good romantic comedy without a shred of credibility.
25051|0|If you want to know why grown-ups don't go to the movies anymore, try suffering through this ludicrous curiosity.
93968|1|Vividly characterised and convincingly acted (not least by Spiridonov), it makes for a fascinating portrait of a post-Communist society beset by crime and despair.
57781|1|Fantastically modern looking film that stands the test of time.
13236|1|Despite the film's weaknesses, Chaplin's lampooning of Hitler is a moment of comic genius, complemented by Jack Oakie's ridiculously exaggerated portrayal of the Mussolini-like Italian fascist
2784|1|Even tweens will enjoy this road trip with Goofy.
91394|1|A bland feel-good flick with a positive message.
48353|1|Sluizer's Americanized remake of his own film is more commercial, but, to me, also more appealing.
95244|1|Though it may be blasphemous to say so, this is one movie that is superior to the book.
59747|0|A pleasant disappointment, pleasant because he gets all the laughs he goes for in a visually charming, sweetly paced picture, a disappointment because he doesn't go for more.
62895|1|...a stand-alone example of a full-bodied courtroom drama.
75675|1|Start engraving that Oscar for Jeff Bridges.
56324|1|A picture as charmingly insubstantial as the world it invokes.
66945|0|The idea of people from the West, previously indifferent, who immerse themselves in sickness and war in an effort to make a difference has been explored less melodramatically in an ongoing story arc on TV's E.R.
89960|1|It is clear that the film was designed to appeal to an intelligent film-going crowd out for a thrill as well as those just looking to get the bejeezus scared out of them.
75605|1|Spielberg was able to make a post-9/11 film about a foreigner in an American airport without getting on a soap box about terrorism or airport anxiety
89900|1|Physical violence, silliness and gross-out moments (suspect gooey substances flow frequently) abound, but Nacho Libre is not without its occasional charms.
95216|0|Even in the fetid swamp of the torture porn genre, it stands out as a particularly awful movie.
87307|1|A film that treats its audience as adults, this is an extremely rewarding work that handsomely pays off the concentration required to watch it.
57980|1|Technology may have changed drastically in the nearly 90 years since this movie was produced, but some things never go out of style.
67364|1|The film explores serious issues of eroticism, control and women's relationships to their own bodies, and should be seen by anyone whose stomach is strong enough to withstand it.
49464|1|...one of those rare films that so vividly paints a picture of a community, that afterwards you feel as though you've been there...
80194|1|So extreme in its sacrilege that it achieves a kind of sacredness, The Holy Mountain is a transcendental feast of the grotesque and the sublime.
51352|0|There is no doubt the movie is lovely to look at; it just hasn't much substance to it or much new to say.
14443|1|Reiner's intermittingly preachy but nevertheless powerful and poignant portrait of hostility and racial strife during one of the ugliest chapters in contemporary American history
14450|1|Garcia turns in a solid, emotionally complex performance, and he keeps the audience involved when the plot takes some credibility-straining turns.
87430|1|Walk the Line is unusually moving without ever becoming mawkish, in the usual biopic way. It's a virtual reincarnation of a peerless American artist.
36237|1|Not sure this deserves to be a classic, but certainly a competently made thriller.
91521|1|If you can get past Mr. Gibson's public persona, Apocalypto is a good, solid action movie.
85591|0|This lazily conceived movie wouldn't be much without the strength of its cast, which saves it the string of cliches that might have buried it.
19414|1|When people talk about the Golden Age of movies in the 1970s, this is one of the ones that they're talking about.
50197|1|A fairy tale for adults, Otik is demented and heartwarming in that particular and unique Svankmajer fashion.
80097|1|Dark Star is, in many ways, the Anti-Star Trek, and deserves its cult classic status.
59797|0|With more than 200 salaried employees on a 10-acre lot that included 9 soundstages, 34 editing suites, and a gigantic trailer that the mogul dubbed the Silver Fish, Coppola videotaped rehearsals in an effort to cut down on film costs. Alas...
10968|1|Whatever reservations one may have about this exhausting, dark-side-of-the-'60s epic, there can be little doubt that Stone has captured a particular, bombs-away brand of rock & roll excess with definitive candor.
76955|0|Unlikely to appeal to anyone, regardless of their thoughts on the first film.
25509|0|Berkowitz went to great trouble to stage, edit, and control certain aspects of his film so that it has a formulaic dramatic structure; one wonders why he didn't make the effort to present himself as a likable human being.
81242|0|If you sometimes have the feeling French films are made by the most spoiled and self-involved upper-middle-class twits imaginable, it might be because of such films as Sex Is Comedy.
62313|0|Which is worse? Lame jokes about gays or lame jokes about the mob?
93776|1|Incidentally, forget the toys, which seem to be upstaged by Wilson's underwear, reportedly the most expensive drawers ever in a movie.
51576|0|It's difficult to make a truly boring vampire picture, but the folks behind this draggy adaptation of Anne Rice's bestsellers The Vampire Lestat and The Queen of the Damned have done just that.
42708|1|Cox's Hannibal is a masterclass in moderation.
83895|0|"finding the plot ""gimmick"" seems to exhaust all of Allen's creativity"
35720|1|Felix and Oscar are now part of the American mythos.
80787|0|Seagal is a fascinating hero: he's not slick, he's not real handsome, he's a real strange dresser, and he doesn't seem all that nice a guy. Nevertheless, he's interesting and he's unpredictable. He gives me the creeps.
66265|1|It's certainly not a subtle movie, but with memorable performances, ludicrously over-the-top one-liners and amiable zaniness, it qualifies as a lot of fun.
99696|1|A beautiful system of obsessions and ambiguities
95986|0|Feature debut of Jake Platrow (brother of star Gwyneth Paltrow, who co-stars) is a disappointing meditation on the danger and seductiveness of dreams, a pale imitation of Woody Allen's edgier urban comedies.
33236|1|It is a dream of life in which everything is reduced to black and white. Or as the rhetoric used to go, you are either part of the problem or part of the solution. Nothing was ever quite that simple.
74313|1|What is happiness within the film's world? Fellini offers no easy answers.
5806|1|Manages to be humorous and moving without being too preachy or heavy-handed.
62043|1|"The screenplay [of ""The Dancer Upstairs""] works more than it doesn't but there isn't the chemistry between the stars I would like to see."
22550|1|(The) endlessly quotable writing... keeps the film fresh as Tom, Aaron and Jane carom off each other at ever-more oblique angles.
42974|1|As a first offering from writer/director David Maquiling, the movie is solid indie fare.
2191|0|An execrable 'comedy,' an insult to Hugh Grant and a felony against Julianne Moore.
67401|1|Dante revives the possibilities of widescreen humor ... literally leapfrogging across time and the cosmos to achieve profundity through expertly controlled chaos.
22881|0|A deeply stupid film.
89447|1|Thoroughly confounding the 'normal' relationship between abuser and victim, first-time director Slade presents a complex morality tale under the guise of an exploitation thriller.
33553|1|A rare film where the actors' charisma overcomes leaden direction. D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly are wonderful.
24581|1|The greatest thing about this movie is the way it brings the game's little details to life.
83965|1|"Herzog se revela um convincente astro do gênero ""ação/terror"" neste filme que, além das muitas risadas, ainda oferece uma reveladora visão dos bastidores de Hollywood."
83679|1|Most definitely, there's something happening here.
38251|1|An aged piece of ghetto-lore that has become less black-counterpart to Heathers and Dazed and Confused than pristine example of serendipity in film.
82593|0|The machine guns are real machine guns, the bombs are real bombs, the drum of motors is the drum of genuine motors. But the actors themselves are false, puny, inadequate, the only real automatons in a world of vital steel.
41455|1|Awful script, but Tomei, Slater, and especially Rosie Perez are magnificent.
51429|1|A warts-and-all portrait of Hollywood at its zenith, a tale of how the bad created something beautiful.
20781|1|One of the Great Films by one of the Great Filmmakers.
22750|1|The driving force of the story is watching Cruise`s character develop some backbone and staying power.
60992|0|A flat, superficial comedy that never establishes a tone.
88052|0|Dreadfully lacking...about as awkwardly received as a training bra on Anna Nicole Smith's bouncy bosom...a cheap-minded farce aimed at the lowest common denominator
12542|1|The movie is an unbending breakdown of the human soul, and perhaps one of the finest - and most confrontational - ever made.
97486|1|Newcomer Teo Gheorghiu does a fantastic job of bringing the title character to life...
39535|0|A sensuous romantic comedy, about as appealing as your average lightweight TV sitcom.
25186|0|Rent CHAINSAW 2
77023|0|Like the movie's title, there doesn't appear to be anybody home in this picture.
66929|0|A movie that moves between pretentious and incompetent, a sleazy straight-to-video-style sex and violence crapfest which ends up simply laughable when it tries to go arty.
7712|1|The characters are wonderfully written.
58273|1|This winning little comedy from Pump Up the Volume director Allan Moyle... is worth seeking on DVD.
101645|1|It's coarse and funny, but there's something really endearing about this twisted romantic comedy in which the protagonist excels at being a self-proclaimed emotional terrorist
12295|1|It still qualifies as one of Kubrick's most underrated pictures, and it's second only to Apocalypse Now as the best Vietnam War movie ever made.
19528|0|Fantastic acting or not... seven Oscars or not... I was bored. And I can't get past that.
95741|0|Here's a strange concept: A goofy, Indiana-Jones-type spin on the pre-Arthur legend.
948|1|As recorded in the great wealth of documentary footage Ofteringer has assembled, the cheekbones slowly collapse and the blue eyes become watery, their owner becoming more and more dependent on hard drugs and fast living.
57885|1|Worth seeing for Sissy Spacek's turn, but the film is incoherent, borrowing elements from To Kill a Mockingbird (Sam Shepard's strange) character and the notion of a sexually harassed woman trapped in her own home, just like Wait Until Dark.
29271|1|Classic '70s adventure has brutal, disturbing violence.
82122|1|If you're looking for something hip, brisk and sexy, then this is a pretty decent proposal.
69424|0|Stuffed with attitude but just as hackneyed as the original.
20755|1|Lean and Bolt pay tribute to a Tolstoyan ambition in Pasternak's samizdat novel, and also to a real contemporary relevance: the story of a suppressed writer.
8314|0|Escape from L.A. is too preposterous to be a good film. But in keeping with its title, it does provide a couple of hours of entertaining escapism.
37007|1|...everything a good, taut, riveting conspiracy movie should be.
39370|1|...funny, joyous, touching, and moving...a very personal film and a most-universal one combined.
73624|1|Gordon Willis' work on this picture is astounding, as he and writer-director-star Woody Allen work in tandem to create a brilliant faux-documentary.
43924|1|Shrek may not have the class of Buzz Lightyear, but he's a lovable great lunk, and you could do a lot worse this summer than see this.
52423|0|Unfunny script.
75488|1|It's a fundamentally Scandinavian movie, a hyperintense meditation on death and destiny set amid a bleak wintry landscape and played out by the emotionally devastated.
82033|1|There's a pleasant delight in the comically dour faces of these old Eastern bloc men, an appreciation of sleepy small-town life in a quaint village.
89097|0|Simply put, Jean-Pierre Jeunet was the absolute wrong choice for this film. His award-winning quirky French visual sensibilities don't mesh well with Joss Whedon's meat-and-potatoes script.
100850|0|Henry too often seems like a suffering cipher rather than a real guy with real problems.
8997|1|Peter O'Toole received an Oscar nomination for playing an eccentric womanizer and boozy star (modeled on Errol Flynn) in this charming comedy set in the 1950s.
981|1|Without it ever being said, we get to meet and deeply appreciate some of the Iranian people who never make the news.
56712|1|Jeong sensitively gives her film an underlying sadness as the young women cope with the changes in their lives
13684|1|Though it lacks the psychological depth of Hitchcock's greatest works, it's characterised by a nightmarish simplicity.
86279|0|What is it that drives talented actresses to dive into a hot pile of cinematic crap soon after winning their first Oscar?
65360|1|Once Upon a Time in Mexico is the film I've wanted to see from Robert Rodriguez since he made Desperado in 1995.
19260|1|Kazan over-emphasized the last sequence in the film, but on the whole, his fine direction shows in the strength and power of the dramatic action on the screen.

41059|0|Never overcomes its overly familiar story and structure, even with some catchy traditional music generously spread throughout.
57504|1|The stripped-down dramatic constructs, austere imagery and abstract characters are equal parts poetry and politics, obvious at times but evocative and heartfelt.
2247|0|Oh, Roland Joffé, thy free adaptation of the Hawthorne classic didst produce abudant derisive laughter. Didst thou once direct 'The Killing Fields?'
98878|1|Tenso, bem montado e dirigido com segurança e inteligência por Carter (que também extrai boas atuações de seu pequeno elenco), o filme consegue o impossível: transformar plantas assassinas em algo assustador.
72645|1|Notable not just for its earnestness and two outstanding performances (both won Oscars) -- it's also got one of the longest catfights in cinema history.
59195|0|Despite Kira's Reason's chamber-drama focus, it never achieves [Madsen's] first film's intimacy.
48690|0|How can you describe a movie that fails so completely in every possible way, its mere existence leaves you flummoxed?
45399|1|A delightfully deadpan comedy about the liberating power of love.
12247|1|This long, expensive 1980 cult movie has an energy and individuality lacking in similar films nowadays.
40901|1|Doesn't fully live up to all the expectations but is still enjoyable.
83106|1|Despite these cliches, director and co-screenwriter Rick Stevenson has created some original moments.
31941|0|Would have you believe it's no more complex than a playground quarrel between boys, girls, and cooties.
55847|1|Great character interaction.

100879|1|Waltz with Bashir brilliantly echoes its cultural investigations with its formal contradictions.
94819|1|Romantic comedy about two lonely people who find each other while orbiting on the outer fringes of society reminded me of 'Napoleon Dynamite.'
31764|1|The jokes and characters are archetypes of America's most ridiculous era, which makes Shampoo serve better as a historical record than a timeless comedy.
36344|1|If [Coppola's] debut film is any indication, talent does run in the family -- even if it is a somewhat disjointed talent.
38421|1|A genuinely scary movie.
62725|0|Makes Fellini look like a pompous ***
5537|0|This road has been trod a few too many times before.
12508|0|Simpleminded, but it's fairly inoffensive, at least until Ashby lingers over the concentration-camp serial number tattooed on Gordon's arm. Some things are beyond the reach of whimsy.
95655|1|The filmmakers probably thought the truth would be too upsetting for children, so we get walrus farts instead.
26241|1|'He was licking me!' That plaintive, disgusted wail is pretty unforgettable once you've seen this one-of-a-kind tongue-in-cheek/blood-in-mouth historical horror movie that has garnered an appreciative cult audience...
72071|0|Occasionally suspenseful but more often ludicrous.
27684|1|It's a solidly entertaining effort -- the kind of movie that can be enjoyed by anyone who appreciates discerning comedy.
27730|1|It's a thrill to behold this supernaturally accomplished triumph of guerrilla filmmaking technique.
19215|1|It may be corny, but you'd have to be a real cynic not to be drawn in.
1378|0|It's airy, fluffy and ultimately uninteresting.
3541|1|What Emmerich achieves is a sense of grand scale that makes the film fun to watch as a space adventure.
31479|1|Intensely watchable movie based on a true story.
34840|0|For every tough-minded confrontation between the different student factions, School Daze is apt to offer a love scene less than vital to the plot, or an overlong musical scene whose effect is that of treading water.
95762|1|The beautiful scenery complements the intimate scenes even as the story becomes something we've all seen and read in so many books and films. Yet, its candid conversations about sexuality are what places Lawrence's protagonist in a class by herself.
66165|1|While avoiding the usual gangster film clichés, director Barry Levinson also insists that Warren Beatty does more than coast through this movie on matinée idol looks and easy charm.
7038|1|James and the Giant Peach proves the best effects are even better with a strong story.

34603|1|Basinger and Bridges keep things hopping
78495|0|The film is about as good as could be expected, considering it's the fifth installment and its premise is absurd.

43248|0|Movie rates itself out of an ideal audience.
1500|0|Mediocre comedy. Like a SNL film but with Frasier instead.
15564|1|The movie, at its best, is good fun: deft, scary, engrossing. Yet it's never great fun.
99186|1|What really sells the film is less its impressive look and sound or unusually expansive length, but more the fact that it's completely all about its two stars.
43996|0|This is so bad, it's good. This is a real disaster.
34886|1|Story is of the clash between sophisticated law enforcement and frontier-style simplistics, which is perhaps one of the major internal American problems.
81875|1|The result is actually much better than anyone had perhaps expected, with a fright quota that actually exceeds the original, even if it completely abandons common sense and rational plotting to get there.
2911|1|Unlike most action movies, when the characters bleed, sweat, and scar, one can't help but notice. There's an emphasis on the physicality of the actors here that elevates some of the scenes above the film's generally uninspiring intentions.
65810|1|Morgan goes out into the big bad, wide world as the naive and innocent everyman, asking the question of the title, but actually posing more complex issues - which address the human condition.

98089|1|Free World doesnâ(TM)t need to manufacture tension; its critique of corruption by association is compelling enough.

28103|1|Stylized like a Ken Burns documentary.
77858|1|Over-ambitious but still utterly beautiful
32914|1|Too funny to dislike.
65109|0|Unfortunately, it dresses Jackie Chan up with gadgetry and gimmickry.
25211|1|The characters here aren't just bad; most of them are truly vile -- human slime. And the film makers chew them up (especially two nefarious bonbons played by Danny DeVito and Bette Midler) with the toothsome glee of jolly cannibals.
117|1|A frothy delight.
7850|0|While some of its antic set pieces are genuinely funny, this fuzzy-focus outing is hopelessly disconnected and ultimately unsatisfying.
66121|0|Unless you are taking a child, there is absolutely no reason you should put yourself through this almost perfectly mindless exercise in canine celebration (exception: if your favorite comic strip is Marmaduke, this may be the movie for you).

7174|1|It may mean absolutely nothing, but it's undeniably one interesting ride -- across universes in a Ford Galaxy.
98843|1|But the success of this documentary may ultimately qualify as faint praise since what it really confirms is that rock 'n' roll's greatest glories happened 40 years ago...
39408|1|There's an edge to The Circus that suggests a man gazing deep into the void, laughing at the darkness and urging us to do the same.
70987|1|This is an unusual and tender story about the love of a family for each other.
92927|1|What makes the film so lovable and still so gladsomely alive today is how closely it hews to Demy's distinctive, celebratory vision of life.
24428|1|...an entertaining, sporadically electrifying piece of work that makes up in thrills what it lacks in relevance.
48562|1|Fuller wrote and directed The Big Red One with a reporter's respect for detail and a humanist's respect for the moments that shape lives.
8668|1|Compounded generously of music, dance, color, spectacle and a riotous abundance of Gene Kelly, Jean Hagen and Donald O'Connor on the screen, all elements in this rainbow program are carefuly contrived and guaranteed to...put you in a buttercup mood.
25655|1|A light comedy, pure and simple (and hardly unfamiliar), but its makers sustain its energy through the unraveling of an intricate plot and bring to it a certain edge through a witty, sharp sense of observation.
3315|1|Reserve judgment until this raw, uncompromising working-class saga is over, and you might find yourself unforgettably moved -- and grateful for the experience.
55664|1|An inoffensive slice of summertime fun.

5220|1|I've already seen The Fugitive twice. I'll probably see it again.
76074|1|A classic with a towering performance by Karloff as Fu Manchu. Only the movie's overt racism can be a mark against it today.
52139|1|Not so much a science experiment as it is a droll satire about love, work and free will.
77789|0|An interesting though not extremely successful experiment, but it definitely makes you want to see what Duncan Roy does next.
3724|1|Surprisingly fun horror. Nothing new, but the coma was creepy and the telepathic kids were scary.

76900|1|Every bit as satisfying as a thriller should be, keeping us hanging at every turn. As the credits roll, we are out of breath.
56448|1|Despite its sad feel, and the fact that it drags almost to a standstill in the middle, it's quite beautiful visually and features fine performances by Bledel, Jackson, and the others.

44447|1|Monroe shines in the superbly photographed and choreographed production numbers, most notably Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend.
9732|1|Lam brings a welcome kinetic energy to the chase scenes, and his action has that fast and furious quality unique to Hong Kong films.
81394|1|A commentary on the troubling gray area between acceptable and unacceptable forms of violence, especially where the molding of boys into 'real men' is concerned.
10154|1|As a testament to its founder's legacy, this is still somewhat lesser Disney. But when viewed in combination for what passes as House of Mouse merriment today ...it's utterly brilliant.
77279|1|The crude semi-autobiographical film is a forerunner to Scorsese's powerful Mean Streets.
74118|1|A star-driven Paul Newman crime mystery drama.

47102|1|A Medieval 'Terminator'....Sands is freakishly good
17809|1|One big advantage this film has -- now brace yourselves -- some of the actors actually speak with French accents!
54025|1|Dark Blue World's warm story and beautiful photography almost hits the mark, and it has a great ending.
41037|1|The Coen's O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a Coen odyssey reworked as a tall tale in the folk song idiom of superstition, magic realism and religious mysticism and delivered with a mix of screwball goofiness and intellectual whimsy.
7674|1|Consistently funny, with sheer brilliant turns from every performer on the cast...
57284|1|If there's a way to effectively teach kids about the dangers of drugs, I think it's in projects like the (unfortunately R-rated) Paid.
30843|1|There's something genuinely religious in Rosetta's stark portrayal of unyielding resurrection.

17242|1|Though this is Egoyan's first adaptation, The Sweet Hereafter could serve as a model for how to do it right.
38729|0|A terrible effort with a bland script, boring plot, and uninspired story...
26063|0|Egads.
68646|1|Rowlands' performance in the title role is one of those tour de force numbers available only to screen players of alcoholics and lunatics.

100057|1|Much like the man himself, it's quite a piece of work.
26601|1|The script, based on a Tom Perrotta novel, is tight and elegant.
92725|1|Like its women, the movie from the perspective of the viewer is ravishingly beautiful but frustratingly remote.
17156|1|It's acted and directed with care, and Damon is outstanding, his scenes with Driver being especially sparky.
93848|1|The all too familiar tale of the upwardly mobile immigrants conflicted between tradition and modernity is played out for all it is worth.
29752|1|Still regarded as one of the steamiest movie's of all time, Body Heat is a fantastic exponenet of how noir has developed.
73850|1|Although the film contains many of the great verbal jokes that are Allen's forte, the visual wit and the sentimental drama fall a bit short.
19758|1|A solid first sequel and the truly chilling jump scare at the end gives the original's a run for its money.
16982|1|[An] exquisitely mounted romantic gem.
93171|0|Cheap special effects and banal dialogue rule.
26235|1|Sumptuously outfitted and well acted, if a little silly and a tad impolitic.
79735|1|There is some good humor in the dialog which not only pays off well against the ghostly elements, but provides a release for laughter so it does not explode in the suspense sequences.
52960|1|A brilliant mix of comedy, drama and thrills. A real delight.
5378|0|If you don't care about such motivations, this is a pretty good thriller, though not one you're likely to remember for very long.
17547|0|Probably a coin-toss victory against a Spice Babies Saturday morning cartoon.
18460|0|If this shoddy enterprise is what it considers topline animated entertainment, [Warner Bros.] is a mere pretender to the Mouse's throne.
57914|0|Scanners is so lockstep that we are basically reduced to watching the special effects, which are good but curiously abstract, because we don't much care about the people they're happening around.
70334|1|Intolerance's sets, costumes, compositions, and mass deployment of bodies in motion are often impressive, especially in the battle of Babylon sequence.
84274|1|takes the framework of a familiar subset of romantic drama and vigorously turns it on its head as a means of tackling an acute example of what it means to be a social outsider
14256|1|The movie that was almost DIE HARD on a cruise ship. Bad script and acting made up for by Segal's butt-kicking, and Lee Jones and Busey in full-on hammy villain mode.
47013|1|Sweet, Silly and Satisfying..
101149|1|It is an elaborately staged tableau, a dazzling use of the camera to achieve essentially theatrical effects. And judged on that basis, Richard Attenborough has given us a breathtaking evening.
13493|1|A rare choke-up movie for guys and one of 1989's biggest hits.
30333|1|Richard Farnsworth brilliantly embodies a man who combines cantankerousness, tenacity and wisdom.
44038|0|There's only one performer in the movie who looks completely at ease with what he's doing: the horse.
89983|0|Makes one pine for any comparable '50s working-girl comedy (or, for that matter, 1988's Working Girl).
43952|0|It's still a one-of-a-kind, we'll give it that. But its sense of fun is so relentless and excessive, it all ends up being extremely tedious and shallow.
87789|0|The farcical elements are much too loaded to provide any real fun, and the Stones come off more as sanctimonious, politically correct left-wing prigs than enchanting.
80320|1|A wonderful film about the friendship between two women and about the marvels of ballet.
44659|1|I felt myself drawn into a vortex of raw emotion from which I could not escape.
74161|0|Thoroughly awful.
53897|1|Breathtakingly, beautifully simple.
26296|1|Mindless, stylish fun.
96451|1|Rendition gives its take on this practice with enough complexity to keep us engaged - and on the fence about how far our nation should go ...
42439|1|Watching Novak and Taylor lay into each other verbally is a treat. Whether that should be what you come away with from a Miss Marple movie is another consideration.
66430|1|Predictable but heartfelt, and valuable in that it is one of the first Filipino-American productions.
96910|1|No Country for Old Men is a thoroughly compelling exercise in the cinema of suspense that proves the power of the old-school thriller remains undiminished.
16529|1|Despite a wooden performance by Keanu Reeves, this is still a thoroughly enjoyable film for those who enjoy an intelligent horror flick.

31644|1|Proves that remakes and new visions of old material need not be redundant.
5367|1|Petersen directs his film in a straightforward, workmanlike fashion-few surprises here -- and, curiously, for most of the film is better at establishing a kind of amiability than a hard tension.
47692|0|The only thing about this movie that really made me shudder is that we are probably going to be deluged with a bunch of crappy sequels for it.
13333|0|The movie surrounds its love story with such boring mumbo jumbo about time travel that we finally just don't care.
31972|1|Out of the memories of his boyhood in Waxahachie, Tex., during the Great Depression, and within the unlikely tradition of the old-fashioned ''mortgage'' melodrama, Robert Benton has made one of the best films in years about growing up American.

15399|1|Filmmaking is a family affair for the Cassavetes, and Zoe inherits the unpretentious, performance-driven style from her father, John, while delivering a love story that's accessible enough for mainstream audiences, a trick learned from her brother Nick.

49379|0|I can think of worse things than Novocaine. Like getting a tooth filled.
48998|0|The one character trait given to Bob Crane in the movie is that he's likable. Paul Schrader has made a movie that isn't--everything about it is out of focus.

35165|0|This hip-hop Romeo and Juliet is awful.
64549|1|Passionada is not as passionate as you may suspect. It's just a tender story about how opposites attract, and how much the nation is opening toward those who are different.
3472|1|A truly remarkable film -- nothing short of a masterpiece.

33730|0|A narrative that tries to juggle thriller elements, tons of pop culture imagery, and way too much philosophical baggage.
41158|1|In terms of modern films, it kicked off a whole list of issue-related multi-character dramas like Syriana, Crash, and Babel -- and it may be the best of all of them, even if some of its stories are stronger than others.

644|0|The movie that most nearly approximates a video game: lots of action, no plot, eye-catching computer effects and a dollop of violence.
22909|0|Clay Pigeons may not actually be a good movie, but it has many of the ingredients of one.
26002|0|You can always tell an Allen film, even without looking at the credits. A name cast, a terrible event, and dialog that ranges from boring to embarrassing.
55943|1|Writer-director Hayao Miyazaki, who previously made the impressive Princess Mononoke, has created a wonderfully bizarre world filled with a gallery of creepy, and some not so-creepy, characters.
15213|0|You can see how the black, modern-day Pygmalion-type story could work, just, but not with this heap of cabbage leaves for a script, and not with such desperately goofy acting from Berry and Desselle.
3904|1|The best things in this transsexual comedy-melodrama are Lizzy Gardiner and Tim Chappel's colorful costumes, which deservedly won the Oscar, and Terrence Stamp's performance, snubbed by the Academy.
89428|1|Has the fourth of any film series ever worked? This does! It's a franchise that could keep on scaring up the spoofs and mixed metaphors till the cows come home to roost.
3992|1|A solid government thriller, but often hard to follow. Lots of talking, but a satisfying climax.
83065|1|Kore-eda coaxes gorgeously realistic portrayals from the children.
41036|1|Mais um ponto para Sandra Bullock, que prova merecer, assim como sua personagem, o título de Miss Simpatia.
71900|1|Frankly, if there isn't already another Harold and Kumar movie in the works, then there should be.
75956|1|From a modern perspective it seems delightful rather than revolutionary, dangerous and subversive.
78424|1|A very good film, regardless of whether or not you love Ray Charles' music. And even if it was a lesser film, Jamie Foxx's performance would have made it worth watching.
9758|1|Unconventional love story about a scientist and his responses to adversity and death.
56695|1|An audacious and insane experiment, a triumphant film.
47779|0|Even worse than the original ... which was pretty dire to begin with.
40558|1|The movie is good, sometimes very good, but I suspect it's a masterpiece only for those who haven't seen all the earlier masterpieces that equal or surpass it.
23004|1|Woody Allen rips off 8 1/2, and the results are often funny and visually intriguing.
49733|0|Turns out it's a lot like an Outer Limits episode that somehow escaped and became a feature.
82833|1|Thel heady film has its moments when it thaws out.
92216|0|I had wanted to like HAPPY FEET more -- I went in expecting a more lighthearted piece. While Miller is to be commended for adding layers to the story, I do feel it went on way too long and that its points were hammered home. And I'm well aware I will be
24255|0|The snowman, which is the work of Jim Henson's Creature Shop, is the most glaring problem. It looks about as real as a man in a costume, and it's tough to suspend disbelief when you're trying to locate the zipper.
8438|1|The Time Traveller's Wife makes for an enjoyable enough movie experience, if all you are after is a few tears, a nice romance and a frequently naked Eric Bana; but viewers unfamiliar with the novel might be left wondering what all the fuss was about.
3448|0|The spoof goes nowhere and takes a long time in doing so.
9752|0|Handsome, but curiously cold, considering the emotional heat of Anglo-Irish matters. Fortunately, Liam Neeson commands almost every frame.
73868|1|Kitano's sensibilities as a blackly-comic director serve the film well
73831|1|Potboiler Hong Kong cop drama with a fairly interesting plot about moral dilemmas and mixed allegiances.
9259|1|It is a film that blends pratfalls and a sophisticated comedy of manners.
55927|1|Perhaps there is something bold about saying pain can bring healing as long as it's applied by the right hand, but that seems obvious and normal thanks to... Gyllenhaal.
39051|0|We've all watched enough Springer to know what happens when a fiance makes a move on the bride-to-be's sister. Those family dramas involve lawyers, if not guns and knives. Never rose petals.
83129|1|Fassbinder himself was cruel and distant to those around him, particularly those who loved him, and in Maria Braun, he created an indelible monster who is perversely fascinating.
45598|0|Absolutely hilarious; Woods and Young all but claw the screen -- and each other
75710|1|Performances crackling with an enthusiasm that indicates how much Porter's work continues to be loved and respected.

22648|1|Despite title, edgy fantasy-fable isn't geared toward kids.
39234|1|This is not your father's Star Trek (for better or for worse).
57283|0|If you saw it on TV, you'd probably turn it off, convinced that you had already seen that movie.
6699|1|McDormand is brilliant, Macy terrific, Presnell perfect, Buscemi fabulous. And Stormare is fascinating as one of the deadliest and most horrid big-screen killers in recent memory. Fargo is a down-and-dirty doozy.
63015|1|Though not as witty as Chan Is Missing and not as touching as Dim Sum, Wayne Wang's Eat Bowl of Tea relates a little known story of the Chinese-American community, putting on screen characters seldom seen in mainstream American movies.
13874|1|...fares a whole lot better than its 2006 remake...
64430|1|With Jason and Freddy at war over the souls of children, this great send-up of the genre is extremely fun and is faithful to the characterizations long-established for these villains.

54513|1|A King King knock off, and one that's highlighted by some awesome creature special effects.
40674|0|As for Bacon and McGovern, it`s sad to see these usually energetic performers labor through a tired script, rarely getting a chance to deliver.
102246|0|Like most acts of cruel mediocrity committed in the name of entertaining children, Igor presumably seemed like a good idea at the time.
88855|1|Forget haunted houses and the mountains of the moon: There's no better environment to show off the wonder of the immersive IMAX 3-D experience than the deep blue sea.
76545|1|"As one of Hollywood's first ""serious"" chronicles of life in an asylum, the film is uneven, containing some intelligent observations but also lurid sequences and simplistic psychological explanations."
66836|1|Peter Hedges sustains the idea this family's interactions have begun with bared teeth for years. If they can summon it, one comforting moment will have to do. At best, it's a ramshackle reconciliation of tough-minded emotion and well-earned laughter.
32006|0|"""Hang on lads, I've got a great idea..."" said Michael Caine at the end of The Italian Job. Presumably he didn't mean waiting 40 years before pulling off a caper that wouldn't blow the bloody doors off a rabbit hutch."
32682|1|...probes at our moral and psychological blind spots, at the limited and self-reinforcing nature of our vision.
76940|0|Because of the generally poor quality of character development, I just didn't care about how things resolved themselves. A strong ending might have redeemed something from this mess, but it was not to be.
82932|1|...merits mention alongside Silence of the Lambs and Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer...offers an incisive analysis of the culture that produced the crime.
43318|0|You wonder why anyone even bothered.
79115|1|Camille (1936) is one of the most romantically-atmospheric films ever made and a classic, well-known melodramatic love/tragedy
59276|1|What [the characters] need most from their maker is something he couldn't have given them at the time: the 1960s.
73396|0|It's a Hammer production, so you know what to expect (or you should!).
19626|1|Worth a look for Fonda, who finally became an actress with this role.
87026|1|[Prime is] an enjoyable romcom, it's sharply observed and has some interesting things to say about relationships. Worth seeing.
21103|1|A sweet good-hearted romance, and the first real sign that both star and director were here to stay.
73779|1|One of the year's most entertaining films.
39379|1|The film's charm owes far more to its creator's brilliant writing than to his anonymous direction.
86653|1|Dillon delivers with a cocky denseness that is at once hilarious and poignant...
2337|0|Though the creators of Strange Days may well be interested in its dramatic and thematic elements, they do not have the same touch for these moments as they do for camera pyrotechnics.
86025|0|Even among the dogs of summer, The Cave scrapes bottom.
87900|1|Intriguingly structured, beautifully shot and superbly acted Western - this is one of the highlights of the year.
35942|1|Howard juggles all the characters effortlessly, showcasing troubles left and right without losing the film to gloom. It's nimble work, blessed with a cast that knows exactly what they're reaching for in their performances.
78505|0|The dialogue mimics the terseness [of Elmore Leonard's work] without the snap or humor. Almost every word sounds recycled from another movie.
28004|1|There are few films so sumptuous that you almost require fabric swatches while watching -- peachy moiré silks, red brocades, eau de nil satins, lilac-grey velvets -- and that's just the menswear and the furniture.
32264|0|Hallström's humanism is possibly a little low key and romantic given such tough themes as abortion and incest.
54114|0|As inelegant as its title.
78446|0|Managing to be both stilted and bizarre, Birth never achieves life.
16858|1|Witness warms up as the attraction builds between Ford, McGillis and Haas -- all performing excellently through this portion.
1381|1|Fast-paced comedy romp which affirms the triumph of good in the great dance of life.
60287|0|Imagine watching half of Band of Brothers in one sitting, but with the story moving at a much slower pace.
87455|1|A lively, imaginative tall tale that should thrill young audiences and engage their parents.
68737|1|With the gathering together of a relatively small cast and less than half a dozen stellar film artists, D.W. has taken a simple, elemental, old-fashioned, bucolic melodrama and milked it for 12 reels of absorbing entertainment.
21503|1|A beautifully realised animation, Watership Down ultimately works because it doesn't dilute the violence and drama of Adams' book with a rose-tinted lens.
100971|1|This solid doc reminds us how unsustainable the current American economy is.
102514|1|Very funny and vastly underrated.
2440|1|Crocker-Harris represents the 'Willy Loman' of the educational system
80226|1|A seminal modern noir work from the 1970s about an innocent and lost soul making his way among liars and thieves...
53277|1|Textbook noir.
57503|0|Reeboir varies between a sweet smile and an angry bark, while Said attempts to wear down possible pupils through repetition. It has no affect on the Kurds, but it wore me down.
38827|1|A silly piece of gross-out joy from the imaginitive Don Coscarelli.
81512|1|There are two stories in Facing Windows, one of them profound and deeply moving, the other pure soap opera.
7230|0|It's not a great film, but it is a little above average.
65000|0|Pretentious, self-righteous melodrama about the evils of patriarchy
53780|0|I know we're not supposed to take it seriously, but I can't shake the thought that Undercover Brother missed an opportunity to strongly present some profound social commentary.
13554|1|While it may be packed with whip-smart, endlessly quotable dialogue and laugh-out-loud moments, its enduring popularity undoubtedly stems from the fact that it has genuine heart.
21231|1|"Ultimately, ""The Outsiders"" feels like two movies awkwardly thrown together - one a tough-acting antiseptic to the sanitized-suburbia Spielberg fantasies that ruled the era's box office, the other a besotted valentine to widescreen epics of old."
89534|1|The cast of eccentrics is endearing, and the lessons of acceptance slide down easily with minimal emotional manipulation.
6151|1|Shadowlands is illuminated from beginning to end by Hopkins. This may be the best thing he's ever done.
46720|0|The premise falters along with much of the shtick.
50712|0|Not since Freddy Got Fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through.
50566|0|Mr. Murphy has two comic moments, which aren't enough for a feature-length film. Among other things, he has developed some of the same maddening mannerisms that marked Frank Sinatra's performances in his Rat Pack movies.
45660|0|Colors has a tentative, ambivalent feel to it--as if Hopper merely considered himself a hired gun who should avoid imposing too personal a vision on the material.
56395|0|Not sweet enough to liven up its predictable story and will leave even fans of hip-hop sorely disappointed.
25110|0|Another unnecessary sequel with gross-out special effects.
1668|1|This stuff works so well because the production is so convincing.
24642|1|Morita is simply terrific, bringing the appropriate authority and wisdom to the part.
46106|1|Charming, talky romance for older teens and adults.
27292|1|Precisely controlled and confidently poetic.
31048|1|The lowbrow and highfalutin collide in an orgy of upscale disembowelment as director Darren Lynn Bousman gives uneasy birth to the gore opera.
91714|1|Toby Jones' uncanny portrayal of the short, effeminate writer with the funny voice, gives the film its credibility and compassion.
37755|1|As much as it is a horror film and western, it is equally and perhaps more pronouncedly a romance.
79284|1|The real star of the film is the gorgeous, luminous, mostly outdoor black-and-white cinematography.
41731|0|This is derivative melodrama with Spielberg hedging his bets by ripping off his previous adventure films to lighten a story that cries out not to be turned into a comic book.
21114|1|There is a shock of recognition almost from the beginning of Tex, because we're listening to the sound of American voices in an authentically American world.
12779|1|Polanski's telling of his tale of corruption in LA is masterly - thrilling, humorous and disturbing at the same time - and brilliantly played by John Huston and Faye Dunaway as well as Nicholson.
20563|1|The film presents a series of utterly charming moments, some magical and some down-to-earth but, considering the setting, equally utopian.
70929|0|An energetic cast and random lines of snappy dialog almost elevate this insipid comedy into something entertaining. But not quite.
13080|0|The movie's vision blurs the man and, incidentally, the just war around him.
38224|1|Most movies that try to crowd so much into an hour and a half end up looking like a shopping list, but Dreamscape works, maybe because it has a sense of humor.
33221|1|A work of dazzling cinematographic invention that still has the ability to astound.
81730|1|It's no earthshaker, but the indie film is refreshingly different from the current movie norm, it's won more than 15 awards on the festival circuit, and war-movie aficionados will find it well worth the journey to one of its four suburban venues.
82460|1|Walks the line between being just creepy enough to be interesting and being completely disturbing.
16952|0|This tedious hodgepodge of martial-arts mayhem, bogus mysticism and computer-generated special effects doesn't even pretend to have a plot.
79124|1|The film has been perceived as a satire on yellow journalism due to Hect'd experience. There's a key line in which a NY journalst is told: A Newspaperman? The hand of God reaching down into the mire couldn't elevate one of them to the depth of degradation
51218|1|This spawn of William Shakespeare and Ray Kroc has more fun with [the] thin premise than you might expect, mostly because of Maura Tierney.
72318|1|There exist few films that exclaim their time's ideas with such gravity as Gimme Shelter.
88433|1|un film dont on se délecte autant pour la redoutable intelligence de son récit et le côté fêlé de sa structure narrative que pour son humour aussi mordant que désopilant
55153|0|It's dead in the water before the climax.
68570|1|Ramshackle chaos and insanity.
1852|1|If you want to dwell on details, you won't like this film, but if you just sit back and relax and try not to be crabby, it is a lot of fun.
67891|0|...[not] as bad as it's been made out to be over the years.
40460|1|Fundamentally, a lot like a TV instalment, only bigger, longer, more extravagant. Fine attributes for an animated kidpic really.
40709|1|"Some of the 1980s-era details may seem a bit dated, and the movie's attitude toward women is slightly despicable, but the overall story arc, echoing the ""Faust"" tale, is timeless."
77860|0|This is one Columbus who should have stayed at home. A real loser.
25239|1|Just as it would be alongside a fire, the spooky power of the myths and legends being spun is all in the style of the storyteller. This delivers the nasty goods with fluid grace and demented glee and is bound to become Halloween appointment viewing.
51141|1|A great film and a great comedy, casually offensive and distinctively, hilariously male.
90012|0|Wilson goes from crashing weddings to crashing newlyweds in a comedy that's as tired as week-old wedding cake.
2776|0|Since the movie tried to be both serious and comedic, having no believable relationships was a real problem.
38498|0|It's dull, sloppy, poorly dubbed and incomprehensible, and appears to have been animated by, well, no one.
30608|1|As unlikely as it seems, Mr. Dalton actually appears to be growing in the Bond role, which is potentially stifling because its own popularity has so rigidly defined it.
90711|1|You've never seen and never will see anything quite like Tears of the Black Tiger.
29524|1|Happy, Texas is a hoot, a hilarious comedy that's smart and caring, yet sexy and ingenious enough that it just might stir up some of that elusive Full Monty-style box-office appeal.
15610|0|Two major issues here: The boy, Marty (Jason Dolley), is a patronizing do-gooder, and the dog, a beagle-looking fella, doesn't do much that's special.
73132|1|Straightforward wish fulfillment -- imagine what crimes against humanity we could punish if we had real, indestructible Rambos.
69824|1|Gives real insight into a part of the world that likely will dominate our newscasts and newspapers for years to come...
37337|1|Not just noteworthy as the first picture written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, this excellent neo-noir also stands as an important film in the development of the American independent cinema during the 1980s.
14649|1|Cute Steve just can't seem to make a good film
46421|1|An interesting historical drama, but lacks the personal touch.
59848|1|Depp is wonderful here, and Sparrrow is the best creation of the movie year.
6081|1|Chess may not be the most exciting activity to watch, but Searching for Bobby Fischer makes for engaging entertainment.
13628|1|Some of the special effects are a little creaky now, but the snap of Landis's editing and the razor's-edge balance of horror and comedy are still fresh.
56517|0|Like watching a Polaroid picture develop without ever getting to see the finished picture.
21929|1|While it's certainly not up to the standard of Hitchcock's great films, Family Plot is still good fun.
9762|1|A triumph for everyone involved, but especially for Stanley Tucci.
76145|1|Michael Moore proves in his scathing yet facile anti-Bush documentary that more than a good filmmaker he is first and foremost indefatigably populist comedian for whom timing is everything.
69885|1|Goodman doesn't allow even a hint of postmodernism or self-consciousness to creep into What Doesn't Kill You, and though the movie's various heists and shootouts are gripping, they aren't especially kinetic or stylish.
100439|1|Some may think the Holocaust has nothing new to offer up, but Michele Ohayon says otherwise.
89460|1|You're not likely to lose a night's sleep over it . . . but you may find yourself double-checking under the bed before turning in.
48103|0|A really good documentary gets inside its subject and examines every aspect of it with a critical eye. Go Tigers! opens a lot of drawers but often only takes the slightest peek inside.
68567|1|A journey down river to the mouth of Hell, but also so much more.
33256|1|Denzel brings the legend to life.
45004|0|A movie that should have crashed at the starting line.
80058|1|Done with a knowing wink and a nod, Slither doesn't offer much in the way of scares, but makes up for it in laughs and decent banter and a number of well executed gross out moments.
29420|0|None of these reliable performers can put enough spin on their roles to conjure up more than the good will they've earned in previous and better movies.
76050|1|As Old Yeller is the classic story of a boy and his dog, Lassie Come Home is the classic story of a dog and her boy.
97439|1|Meehl's gentle handling of her subject and her unobstrusive, observational camera work make this a delightful and touching experience.
96136|1|It's a pleasant diversion -- an enjoyable romantic comedy that has enough going for it to make it worth a recommendation.
19519|0|Luedtke and Pollack bought these high-priced literary sources only to chuck them for a conventional, largely fictionalized movie romance.
1251|1|Beautifully photographed and directed with an intimate maturity, the film reveals its characters in an unhurried way, thus making the audience accomplices in the unfolding liaison.
31964|1|Set in the Depression, Benton's memory film is too sanctimonious and idealistic, showing how economic misery and hard times bring out the best, here in the form of a new community, composed of a white widow and her children, a black hobo and a blind.
83359|0|Rachel Weisz gives it her best shot, but she can't save the messy script from its own feelings self-importance.
46942|0|Shocker represents a low point (perhaps the lowest point) in the career of horror master Wes Craven. With lazy and uninspired writing, in addition to a mishmash of ridiculous plot points, this is a film that is best (and easily) forgotten.
13840|1|An inventive and terrifying horror film that explores the inner psyche and its ability to turn nightmares into reality.
24282|1|Stewart looks great as usual and is impeccable in his familiar role, but most of the other principals were seriously underused.
8765|1|Alfred Hitchcock's answer to why he makes films and perhaps his darkest one, both as a romance and as a thriller.
17136|0|The new version is a total dud.
63857|1|"Of the three films, ""On the Run"" is the most successful as a standalone piece."
12156|1|It's visually exciting, off-handedly funny, and genuinely informative.
27616|1|Assayas avoids easy resolutions, and Ali Farka Toure's score reminds us that each year brings with it a possibility that one will change the cycle.
79503|1|Hypnotic drama about a Parisian pickpocket.
44993|0|This wholly derivative car-chase movie provides a flimsy excuse for good ol' boy Burt Reynolds to cavort on-screen with a cast that's chock-full of familiar faces.
3828|0|Someone should tell Hollywood that the mass-killer genre is dead and that its virtual reality counterpart is already wheezing.
24288|1|The movie's proudest accomplishment is that it revises our version of Moses toward something more immediate and believable, more humanly knowable.
92712|1|Zhang's beauty is one of furious defiance
68346|1|Rarely seen in this country in the intervening 23 years, Dalle gives one of the all-time-great performances as Betty.
10530|1|Director-cinematographer Doug Liman gets points for breathing a bit of life into an already tired indie sub genre.
87676|1|At once amusingly entertaining and yet searingly revealing, Inside Deep Throat is documentary gold
56311|1|Brilliant. Stupid...but brilliant.
93881|1|A time-twisting drama that ties every detail together in a satisfying conclusion. Sandra Bullock gives one of her best performances to date.
18266|0|This is a dirty piece of work, and everyone it touches -- especially audiences -- deserved better.
9558|1|The great screwball comedies of the 1930s and '40s are polar opposites of today's, which makes revisiting them a joy.
88292|0|Entertaining and funny, if a little thin. David doesn't knock out Goliath.
5617|0|Declaring yourself bored by a movie full of explicit sex may sometimes mark you out as a dreary pseudo-sophisticate, but in this case it's fair enough.
18720|1|Embracing Hartley's motifs, such as the vicissitudes of fame and fate, the film is sharply uneven, meditative and touching in moments but also pretentious and overlong; it's the last decent movie Hartley has made.
101890|1|A light but heartily funny diversion, best served with a raucous audience who appreciate a masterful KISS joke when they see one.
15581|1|a filmmaking exercise from someone eager to stretch his legs, do something goofy, and experiment, all of which Soderbergh does without losing his audience
51812|0|This movie was about the most excruciating hour and a half I've endured recently.
77891|0|Although the vocal performances often amuse and delight, the overall design is charmless.
2713|0|That guarantee of good taste is, finally, a bit of a downer; there are plenty of surprises, but no hint of risk.
44790|1|It's nice to see a new director willing to spend as much time with his actors as he does moving the camera around.
85610|0|Hardcore fans will undoubtedly be satisfied but its unlikely this will spread much beyond that audience, and even they will find it lacks that human spark and freshness that made the series distinctive and appealing.
76046|1|MGM tear jerker supreme for dog and child fans.
1967|0|A senseless comic exercise in pushing the limits of decency for that sake alone.
99293|0|Comic desperation can be seen at alarmingly frequent intervals.
88591|0|Director Richard Loncraine shows no affinity for the nuts and bolts of constructing thrillers, playing out the script's empty threats and chases at a lethargic pace.
59032|1|Emotional engagement has never been one of Polanski's strong suits, but the film succeeds in spite of that.
69669|1|Every shot seems designed to show off the unique location, or fill the screen with something interesting.
30056|1|A macho male fantasy that still plays to the inner rebel in all viewers who harbor such a streak.
77536|0|Mr. 3000 has nothing extraordinary to contribute to the ever-growing pile of sports movies with an ineffective artillery of weak comedy and romance.
49233|0|"I like Jet, but...this particular ""Version"" of the idea deletes nearly all ripe tangents."
85374|1|"Além de revelador e interessante, sua inteligente montagem prende a atenção do espectador através do desenvolvimento de seus ""personagens"" e do conflito entre os dois times principais."
41240|0|[O]verly long, uninspired, and frequently awful...
47776|0|Clearly made with an eye on the international market, this movie is set for the most part in Japan, shrewdly adding a female ninja to the three boys, thus broadening the potential demographics.
43335|1|Joe Mantegna... brings just the right tone of easy gab and tossed-off tales to this actor's showcase.
6605|1|Hopkins' performance may be the film's bravura showpiece, but Foster's goes the whole distance, steadfast, controlled, heartbreakingly insightful, a fine addition to her gallery of characterizations.
102180|0|There is no spark to the humor, there is no warmth to the drama. There is a tired plot that whips the essence of every Christmas movie ever made into a dreary slog
22805|1|There isn't one schmaltzy moment in the entire film, and any tears the viewer sobs into their hankies are well-earned.
82707|1|The breathless pace, the good script, and the mostly fine performances made me more forgiving of the dated aspects of this film. Overall, though, it's Gary Cooper's film.
22147|0|From a director of De Palma's resources -- both aesthetic and, these days, financial -- it's fair to expect something more than just not being bored.
42189|0|Company Man offers precious little to laugh about.

102192|0|[Director] Mark Herman knows how to milk the melodrama from every scene, but viewers may feel a little icky about the experience.
27754|0|In the final analysis, the marquee names are all that really distinguish Eyes Wide Shut from, say, a really well-photographed installment in the Emmanuelle series.
63619|1|This one isn't for everyone, but it's still good in my book.
46470|1|The movie is a whirlingly divergent romp, blending serious violence with outrageous comedy, but it has the feel of oral history, of lives and times rescued from oblivion.
30024|0|Crudely-made in just about every possible way, Flashdance has only nostalgia going for it.
97764|0|One Missed Call remakes Takashi Miike's 2003 film as undistinguished college-age horror, except it tries to exploit some people's fear of answering the phone into a feature-length premise.
29785|1|Hilarious comedy classic; language makes it PG-13.
85495|1|Isn't it great when a piece of classical music gets forever redefined by a movie about a bunch of foul mouthed brats? What could be a better way to spend 102 minutes of the truth?
72793|1|The Wages of Fear is a frantic, vicious, existentialist howl that still manages to laugh; it goes grinning into the void.
83733|1|Director Michael Apted has taken what could have been a routine courtroom drama and built instead a stunning study of familial love and misunderstanding.

21116|1|Tex explores the stressful relationship between two brothers living without adult supervision.
95658|1|Well intentioned, spectacularly filmed, and packing a vital message, Arctic Tale is worthwhile, even if its old style presentation leaves us less than thrilled.
66128|0|"One long, fuel economy-eroding idle before a mildly interesting vehicle stunt. For all its potential, ""Black Moon Rising"" only proves history's deep, dark cracks are there for a reason and some movies are fated to fall into them at 325 miles an hour."
45626|0|The original was no great shakes, but this is beyond bad.
20436|1|A fascinating if problematic early film from Stanley Kubrick, perhaps the most obsessive of the great auteurs of the 1960s.
21089|1|The movie that really showed Tom Hanks' promise as a deliverer of great comedy and heart-warming pathos.
75879|1|Creepily entertaining.
15987|1|A bitterly promising screenwriting-directing debut from playwright Neil LaBute.
40430|1|This cinematic candy floss honours the Seussian universe by satirising our own. And Carrey's comic tornado of a performance is a triumph.
83226|0|O filme é tecnicamente irrepreensível, mas o ritmo lento da narrativa e a auto-indulgência do diretor Lou Ye simplesmente destroem a paciência do espectador.
63118|0|'An irritating, disjointed mess that can never decide what kind of film it wants to be.'
94479|1|Spider-Man 3 probably would have been better as two focused 80-minute films. The ambitious, overstuffed, and complicated 139-minute one that we have isn't as well-proportioned as its predecessor, but it's full of canny insights and bits that ring true.
40265|0|The road to hell is paved with ... bathroom humor.
1221|1|A tight, tense, taut thriller with a killer-sting in it's tail
65864|0|Despite confident direction and performances, it rarely lifts itself above the ordinary.
101283|1|Technically, the sedate yet stunning 35mm camera is there for the ride and somehow never imposes or dominates the content. And the result is a true triumph.
241|1|Actually one of Renny Harlin's better efforts.
102459|0|Reactions to the movie will largely depend on whether or not viewers decide this time that the divine Mr. Smith has overreached. I say he has -- but I can't tell you why.
28764|0|Wilson's performance consists of spouting demeaning dialog.
5739|1|The screenplay by Alan Zweibel and Andrew Scheinman packs more on-target social satire than any film in recent memory, and zesty performances keep it clicking along at a rapid pace.
72098|0|falls consistently flat, despite the best efforts by all involved
57075|0|What is new for a Fassbinder work is that the film is far more entertaining to watch than it is interesting to speculate about. That means it's a disappointment.
58284|0|Its failure to present any kind of historical context ill serves the indigenous African peoples whom Endfield presumes to honor.
57558|1|Brian De Palma returns in full style with his best movie since Scarface.

33935|1|Edgar G. Ulmer somehow managed to transform the absurd limitations of the scripts, budgets, and actors he was given to work with into a mad aesthetic principle.
51296|0|If even half the scenes with the girls singing along to pop songs in the car were cut, Crossroads would barely qualify as feature length.
47164|1|Celebrates one family's resiliency in facing the accidents and perplexities of sex, violence and death.
53732|1|Marilyn turns in a surprisingly okay performance.
67223|1|It plugs ahead on the stamina and sheer nerve of its author-star.
93056|1|Thanks to its subtle touches and strong character development, Bridge to Terabithia is not only entertaining for the family but for anyone who wants to leave reality behind for a little while.
65258|1|The top-notch cast makes this movie work. Carlyle is born to play the hard-to-resist rogue, and Henderson conveys a sexy vulnerability ...
13947|0|This makes little concession to non-initiates.
67091|1|the film's achievement is to show there are stories worth hearing, and ravaged, resilient faces that reward our scrutiny. The horror, the gallows humor, the shame and the heroism, the lessons of this holocaust -- and all others--have not been exhausted.
38654|0|Rape that's anal and bestial! Scrotal lint! Noodly penises! One Eddie Murphy character desperately begging to give another one gummy oral sex in a hot tub! Bring the whole family!
33691|1|To this day, six months after seeing the film for the first time, I still do not know the answer to one of the biggest moral dilemmas I have ever seen. Casey Affleck's character has to make a decision at the end of this film that just blew my mind.
88897|1|I'm not going to beat around the glacier. If you liked Ice Age, you're going to like this sequel.

33713|0|It's rather ordinary stuff.
67800|1|Just as dreams take complex personalities and boil them down to friend or foe, so too The Cabinet of Dr Caligari brims with archetypes: the demented doctor, the handsome hero, the innocent ingénue.
19308|1|It has sex, Eastmancolor, some prime performers and plenty of action.
13564|1|When Harry Met Sally is funny and likable, but it will be a torture chamber for anxious singles.
57277|1|Stone seems to have a knack for wrapping the theater in a cold blanket of urban desperation.
86024|1|Not a classic by any means, but possibly one you might want to add to your Netflix queue for a rainy day.

84421|0|Clanks on nearly every level.
91319|1|Flawed editing and intrusive and irritating commentary hardly detract from the shock value of this disturbing documentary. Compulsory viewing for anyone in the least bit concerned about religious extremism.
45742|0|That it is awkwardly conceived, the premise is absurd and it's just not funny, are its major flaws.
97564|0|A mindless distraction.
28394|0|about as thrilling as a long line at customs. The screenplay (is)apparently based on those recorded warnings played in airports... Danes and Beckinsale struggle to bring some conviction to a story sorely in need of it.
86139|1|...a thoroughly enjoyable, not entirely predictable sentimental comedy/drama...
57447|1|It's as close to Fleming's books as we've seen since the early days of Sean Connery. And it's darker, for sure, and more brutal than almost all of the movies.
1511|1|Some of this is silly and dumb as jokes fall flat. But there are also some laughs to be had.
51642|1|Price plays a scientist who is the last survivor on Earth after a plague has turned the rest of the population into vampires.
60728|0|It never quite convinces you this is anything but a fashion shoot.
53464|1|[Diane Lane] is more than enough reason to see Unfaithful.

49474|1|Beneath every smooth exterior runs an undercurrent of turmoil, unrest, and danger.
49158|1|La ville est tranquille is not depressing, but a sense of sadness permeates the film. As dramatic as it is, Guediguian's point is well taken: this town will remain quiet.
87195|0|At once alien and familiar: part Old World folk tale, part inspirational sitcom.
1469|1|The story lacks focused character conflict that would make it a truly fine cinematic experience.
39606|1|This gay heart-warmer may have a fuzzy, sitcom-ish appeal for some.
53660|0|Lumbering, misguided mess
37452|1|It's passable entertainment for a while, but even with the short 87 minute running time it starts to feel a bit long in the tooth
22137|0|At the story level, Willow is turgid and relentlessly predictable.
4498|1|It is movies like Wolf that reinvigorate the movie fan lurking inside us all, showing us that commercial and artistic success can truly coexist in modern cinema.
44953|1|The Vertical Ray of Sun is beautiful, languorous, passive -- it plays like background music for itself.
56709|1|The level of maturity displayed by this 33-year-old first-time feature director is astonishing, considering her inexperience and her subject matter.
77594|0|A ponderous but very, very explicit exploration of gender roles and fears that frequently seems like a parody of the genre.
83147|0|Even kids won't get much of a kick out of this high-energy, low-IQ futuristic slugfest.
3125|1|Hawthorne is so good it almost hurts to watch.
15988|1|A dark, probing, truly disturbing exploration of yuppie angst and male anxieties as they manifest themselves in both the work and personal arenas.

43308|1|Regardless of the credibility of Read's exploits, Andrew Dominick has crafted a film that plunges his audience into the depths of Australia's criminal underworld.
76665|1|In this molasses-slow four-hour drama, Jacques Rivette proves that he's got an understanding of fine art, but a minimal one of the art of movies.
70273|1|This film deserves the cult status it has among more serious science fiction fans.
93491|1|Lowbrow hilarity for adult fans of the TV comedy.
67886|0|Highlander 2 is a mess. Nevertheless, damn it, it's a gorgeous mess...incoherent, but a joy to stare at for 105 minutes, watching as a franchise is epically flushed down the toilet.
92570|0|This stab at grand romance fails to satisfy.
4675|1|Kind of scary return to form for Carpenter.
6702|1|In the fascinating Fargo, writer-director Joel and writer-producer Ethan have come up with a film that is either an oddly funny crime drama or an ultra-deadpan comedy, depending on how you look at it.
21633|0|Everyone struggles. Everyone triumphs. The music swells. No one cares.
63905|0|Hackman mostly just stands around watching Aykroyd run through his exertions with the look of a man who has something unspeakable on the sole of his shoe.
100056|1|The film's plea that we need Thompson now more than ever is a little misty-eyed: Thompson's day was long gone by the time he put a gun to his head.
96113|1|Un drama detectivesco conmovedor que termina siendo un alegato contra la guerra más contundente que cualquier discurso pacifista.
1131|0|This startlingly uneventful compendium of thick-headed boy-talk and female tolerance squanders a fine cast on incredibly ordinary characters and situations.
100097|1|Though it is a bit slow-moving, this documentary feature is visually stunning.
45718|1|Speaks softly but delivers some provocative observations on sexual politics, family pressures, loneliness, single life, love, and romantic fantasies.
30727|1|No one will accuse music-video director Spike Jonze of making his feature-film debut with a boring, conventional movie.
12723|1|Robert Surtees's stunning, innovative camerawork contributes telling visual ironies and the Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack perfectly captures the mood of disaffected youth seething beneath the laid-back exterior of 1960s California.
69264|1|The slice-of-life pic also has neat slices of observation, tasteful presentation and easeful acting that avoid banality.
18490|0|A middling funny film with a good, if silly, performance by Warren Beatty, and not much more.
66155|1|What finally distinguishes Bugsy from other mob movies is its ever-present sense of the absurd.
81472|1|This small, somber drama says things to battered women they probably already know. What it says to their abusers -- of any country or culture -- they can't afford to ignore.
95743|0|A passably entertaining hodgepodge of sword-and-sandal film clichés and Arthurian romance.
17298|0|Judd, Jackson and Garcia's work is pedestrian at best. But they did accept this script.
52870|0|It offers the illusion of originality by bombarding audiences with Greek stereotypes, but really clings to the formulaic romance comedy.
92084|0|Tykwer loses his cinematic grip when he tries to blend murder and piety. In his hands, the two don't emulsify.
91658|0|Like a sputtering career, Ellie Parker pretty much goes nowhere, and it's difficult to imagine that it would be of interest to many beyond the Hollywood community.
78568|1|It's stylish, campy, gay, and signature Almodóvar.
19450|1|Oscar-dominating 1970s weepie that is just waiting to be rediscovered.
43887|0|Shrill and punishingly unfunny.
74635|1|The result is remarkable -- a semi-lucid, feverish tale of female relationships that disintegrates into a kind of woozy, oppressive madness.
10179|0|"The Disney organization is worst when it makes ""family entertainment"" and best when it sticks to pure, simple, charming fantasy."
74573|1|What is a villain if not someone who has been pushed too far in life and has started to push back? And with nothing to push against, what do they become?
37820|1|Grapples with the moral issue at stake in a country where technology has outstripped out knowledge of how to use and control it
30553|0|This ultraviolent, nihilistic sequel has enough technical dazzle to impress hardware fans, but obviously no one in the Orion front office told filmmakers that less is more.
50445|0|It seems there is almost no prized novel that director Lasse Hallstrom couldn't make duller and less purposeful.
30946|1|It's no match for The Evil Dead, but as far as tongue-in-bloody-cheek gorefests go, this update of the H.P. Lovecraft tale is a lot of fun, and it easily earns its cult status.
81709|1|Un peu de rose bonbon, ça se prend bien de temps en temps, même dans le monde du cinéma.
66582|0|The virtue of GoodFellas was that it took the glamor out of mob sagas, and it's going to take a picture a lot better than Mobsters to put it back in.
59751|0|Picturesque but uncertain.
73037|1|No doubt about it now: Japan's Akira Kurosawa must be numbered with Sergei Eisenstein and D. W. Griffith among the supreme creators of cinema.
28154|1|Even with a flaccid sign-off, Menage manages to be wonderfully different.
97822|1|Urban dance drama is formulaic yet entertaining.

69328|1|takes us to a place that many of us will find difficult and joyful at the same time
36282|0|The performances by this Young Hollywood set are nothing short of ordinary, and cameos from vets Olmos and Bogosian are downright embarrassing.
92046|1|"Despite being heavy-handed and pretentious, and never providing a satisfying conclusion, Gabriel Range's fake-umentary ""Death of a President"" is nevertheless brilliant in its conception and execution."
71412|1|Kaufman's latest is a weird, visually woozy rom-com-in-reverse that charms, amuses and moves.
80004|1|Dalton Trumbo (member of the Hollywood Ten) sole directing effort is one of the most hauntingly powerful anti-war film made, an experimental work that's effective as realistic portrait of war's damages as well as metaphoric, quasi-religious journey.
85572|0|Just imagine the hilarious genre-spoofing Team America: World Police sans puppets without the jokes...
16866|1|Powerful, assured, full of beautiful imagery and thankfully devoid of easy moralising, it also offers a performance of surprising skill and sensitivity from Ford.
65700|0|Anything Else dangerously embraces the vibes of mediocrity and that's a crying shame for an artist so capably adventurous as Allen once was in his heyday of potent hilarity.
76656|1|De Sica may seduce us with his breezy comedy but concealed beneath is his usual preoccupation with class, making the laughs in Yesterday, Today And Tomorrow delightfully brittle.
24185|1|A vicious, disturbing black comedy that delivers a wickedly entertaining ride if you don't take it too seriously.

25414|1|Ken Loach at his best.
54257|0|There's a price to pay for the guilty pleasure Steven Brill's film affords -- a relentless process of dumbing down that tells the audience it's cool to be a doofus.
16309|1|Very kick ass
57471|1|A nimble comedy that doesn't make much sense because it makes nonsense, most of it screechingly funny and played by knockabouts who know that the slapstick was invented for keeping an idea aloft, not for beating it into the ground.

21923|1|It's not exactly top-tier Hitchcock, but it features enough good stuff to make it at least worth one viewing.
39240|1|I didn't go to this with much enthusiasm but, of course, it's been completely reinvented by J.J. Abrams and he's done a terrific job.

93536|1|Despite being bogged down by several distracting, extended dance numbers, this zany farce has just enough momentum and surprises along the way to hold one's interest for the duration. But it'll help immeasurably if you're a devotee of daytime soap operas.
79899|1|This is one of those time capsule films - for that it is important
12046|1|As Mulligan so deftly demonstrates, the story is in the characters, their failings and fragility, their heroism and nobility of spirit.

48955|1|Well worth seeing if you have even the slightest interest in guns and sex and the interplay between the two (and who doesn't?).
36553|1|The film is well worth seeing, but the real attraction is the stunning depiction of Atlantic City.
101201|0|Watchable mockumentary with strong performances, but it's not as funny as it should have been and is ultimately both depressing and uncomfortable to sit through.
96957|0|It attempts to conquer social, political and military all in the same film, but it doesn't knock any of them out of the park.
16846|1|Considering the potentially explosive nature of the yarn, set in the porn world, Anderson's strategy is remarkably nonjudgmental and nonsensationalistic, largely due to his love and respect for all the characters and his impressive storytelling skills.
52683|0|While it may look like any other campus comedy at first glance, Van Wilder is actually different from the rest, with its refreshing, fun-filled and wacky script.

70185|1|The stage show is all about oiled hardbodies and sculpted musculature, but the movie is a portrait of competition as war and Schwarzenegger as the warrior supreme...
50683|1|Shot through with a comprehensive pessimism, a feeling of hopelessness complete with corrupt governments, fanatical zealots, and the world falling into darkness unfamiliar.
19128|1|How Green Was My Valley is one of the year's better films, a sure-fire critic's picture and, unlike most features that draw kudos from crix, this one will also do business.
21808|0|Two hours-plus of melodrama and dancing dancing dancing danczzzz zzzz zzzzzzzz....
18290|1|Has a visual style that seems rudimentary but becomes increasingly hypnotic and resonant.
61013|0|One should be rooting for Cary Grant to get the girl, which means he ought to deserve her — and if that's more or less the case here, well, it's only because the girl turns out to be no great shakes either.
26966|1|...a studio product, certainly, but also something that could have grown from one of Smallville's sun-kissed cornfields.
9184|1|'Weepies' may not be high art, but for those who love them, An Affair to Remember is the Mona Lisa.
79558|1|Frank Perry's soft, romanticized look at two misfits in an asylumn, played by the attractive Keir Dullea and Janet Margolin, this early indie film became a campus favorite in the 1960s and led the way to the rise of independent cinema in the 1970s.
3589|0|An almost astonishingly interminable thriller...
352|1|Oh, how this picture satisfies.
54779|1|It's a rough slog... but La terra trema shows that Visconti, with just his second feature, was already a master of the medium.
56775|0|That the end result is convoluted, lacking in logical coherence, and sometimes downright silly is not ideal, but you can sense the genuine desire to take the story in a new direction
91914|1|"The film is never less than engaging, though considering that the title The Prestige refers to the moment in a magic act that gives it its ""wow"" factor, it's kind of a shame that the ultimate ""reveal"" in the movie is a little too tricky for its own good."
83075|0|...there's ultimately very little here to appeal to even the most die-hard Cook fanatic.
43485|0|Much like how Liv Tyler's beauty is softened by the affectless drone of her voice, the film's stylish flash is made less inviting by some dullness in design.
1002|1|Antonia's Line is a Dutch treat that unfolds like a generous novel, surrounding you with its indelible sense of time, place and character.
42163|0|It's sappier than a Christmas tree.
70755|1|Sharif proves that at age 72 he can still command the screen.
100190|0|The infectious, decades-old ABBA songs on which the film is anchored are the only thing keeping it afloat.
35652|1|"The mystic quality within ""Network"" is that it pitches curve balls at us that have meanings relative to our unique situations, and all of them encompass a value that is beyond simple comprehension."
11851|1|Harmless. Fun.
90712|0|The early scenes are interesting and enjoyable. And then the novelty wears off, but the film doesn't end.
55062|1|...a rich and intelligent film that uses its pulpy core conceit to probe questions of attraction and interdependence and how the heart accomodates practical needs. It is an unstinting look at a collaboration between damaged people that may or may not qual
5172|0|The fact that this was a hit proves, once again, that the average IQ is only 100.
26406|1|Understandably lacks the surprise element, but it is fresh enough in its own way.
92858|0|There's little here for British eyes.
25290|1|"Have a very ""g'day"" watching this one."
35975|1|The Prince of Tides marks Ms. Streisand's triumphantly good job of locating that story's salient elements and making them come alive on the screen.
63442|1|When at its best, it's easy to understand its cult status.

68139|1|Much of it has a seriousness and intelligence that are all too rare on today's movie scene.
71906|0|The story makes little sense, while offering few surprises and even fewer scares...it might be a cinematic act of faith for some, but simply as a movie it's a travesty.
22553|1|People often behave foolishly in matters of love and just about everything else. That can lead to heartache and tragedy, but that same foolishness can also be very funny to watch, as it is here.

71000|1|If you take it as historical fact, it's got a world of problems. But if you're just in the mood to be entertained, it can be a decent piece of Saturday afternoon escapism.
91137|0|If BET made after school specials, this is what they would look like.
74751|0|One of the weakest kids' films in recent memory.
38855|1|[Blu-ray Review] From the awesome newly commissioned cover artwork, to the terrific A/V elements, to a slew of new bonus content going above and beyond the call of duty, this is nothing less than a dream release. Buy it. Like, now.
30456|1|Banderas directs capably enough to keep the film lively.
92378|1|Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny proves one thing: Rock and roll never dies. It just gains weight.
58046|0|An attractive cast, silly gadgets, bad puns, worse CGI and a totally ludicrous plot make this the least of the Brosnan Bonds, but it all paves the way for an injection of grit with Casino Royale.
78786|0|The film is a series of sight gags, with not too many hitting the mark.
70595|0|A unworthy sequel to a good idea.
54076|1|A precursor to the far better Rear Window, but noir has seen better days.
46627|0|Ridiculous nuclear holocaust tale
17372|0|There's no denying the artistry of Kundun. Its heart also appears to be in the right place. But for those like me who don't have a versed history in the modern history of Tibet or Buddhism, the scope is ultimately too big.
16492|1|Judi Dench's glacial, reserved demeanour contrasts beautifully with Billy Connolly's natural, rebellious exuberance, and their resultant spark of chemistry is undeniable.
4634|1|Very frightening. An inspired remake.
10242|1|Appealing to the whole family and giving Julie Andrews a chance to sing and perform charmingly, it presents Christopher Plummer as Captain Von Trapp, a role that is sure to enhance the popularity of this fine actor.
90768|0|"You'd half expect the movie to throw caution to the wind and become ""Grandmas Gone Wild,"" but the film is too prim to offer any surprises."
71245|0|The American male hypocrisy toward sexually active women in general -- and porn in particular -- is at the center of the new comedy The Girl Next Door. Unfortunately, instead of being the movie's target, it's the subtext.
16415|1|Quinn gives a commanding performance as both Ramirez and Carlos.
99001|0|There's an abundance of toilet humour, masturbation, oral sex and fantasies about threesomes with an oversized bag of weed ... The target market will no doubt be primed
56446|1|Attractively filmed and pleasantly conceived, it ventures too far into sentimentality, and not far enough into its fascinating life versus immortality subject matter.
29446|0|Much too gentle to inspire any dramatic reaction on either end of the opinion spectrum.
13800|1|... [O]ne of the best horror films of the 1970s.
30375|1|This film is unusually dark for a modern children's film. At times a grimly comic fairy tale, Time Bandits offers little reassurance. It's a tough world out there--even in our imaginative life. Perhaps that is why we need heroes so badly.
41280|1|"""a dark jewel of a drama, with first-rate performances"""
60081|1|It isn't a great film, or even a greatly original one. Still, it has many grace notes, and interesting oddities.
31051|1|Repo! isn't like anything else out there, for whatever it's worth, or anything I've ever seen; between us, though, I'm going to hold out for a midnight staple more my speed.
24455|1|The filmmakers have devised some clever twists on the earlier films they recall, and they reserve a good share of the derring-do for their heroine, who's a refreshingly far cry from the helpless ladies-in-distress of old.
68702|1|A cracking jest, wonderfully enjoyable.
1235|1|"From beginning to end, there's not a slow moment in ""Happy Gilmore,"" the Tiger Woods of gleefully idiotic comedy."
95811|0|Please, enough with Napoleon Dynamite Syndrome already.
39023|0|This negligible comedy might as well come with a bouncing ball so members of the audience can recite the dialogue along with the actors.

23056|0|What happened here?
73903|0|...the overwhelming vibe of silliness eventually becomes exhausting.
13016|1|A surprisingly solid celebration of teen angst and rebellion. Soundtrack was quite choice, as well.
19964|0|Grisly, tongue-in-cheek sequel isn't for kids.
85901|1|A pure children's film with an exciting story, genuine characters, and deep messages about life, love, and loss.
61413|0|To get so little energy from such talented actors is an act for which Solomon should seek redemption.
70677|0|Comes off less like a feature film than a failed sitcom pilot.
40820|0|It's like the kind of lesson a schoolteacher might prepare for incredibly sleepy students.

66294|0|The screenplay writers throw the story away in a finale which celebrates the machismo the rest of the film mocks.
77664|0|It's got some really solid actors and even a fairly amusing premise ... so where are all the laughs?
64348|1|Beautifully retells a spiritual story without resorting to the overbearing piousness that makes most American Bible films such well-intentioned slogs.
51549|1|Very '50s sci-fi with giant insect on the climb, and typically fun overall.
15276|1|If you shut your brain down you'll have some fun.
99534|1|Demands we throw out our preconceived notions and face the issue without walls to protect us.
78832|1|For moviegoers with sky-high imaginations and mushy hearts, D.A.R.Y.L. satisfies like a summertime chocolate-chip ice-cream cone.
89869|0|Nothing in On a Clear Day is especially compelling. The movie doesn't dig deep enough.
58421|0|Remember to get your bets in early as the Razzie winner for 2005.
51754|1|If you appreciate fine animation and edgy material, this blood's for you.
52923|1|Excellent satire!
66619|1|School of Rock made me laugh harder than any movie I've seen this year.
62055|1|Not surprising that it's more tragicomedy than yukfest.
82928|1|"A much better movie than the more recent and more heralded ""Mother"", another movie about a killer."
30880|0|There's no room for Buster to stretch out; none of the rhythms are remotely like his own.
38619|1|The film has lost none of its silly charm in the ensuing decades.
32212|0|In his enthusiasm to both educate and entertain, Robbins has grossly overreached his abilities to formulate a digestible narrative, piling on stories, characters, issues and political debate such that the film begins to feel incomprehensibly and oppressiv
90386|1|An astonishing twinning of wild imagination and drop-dead realism.
73017|1|A mesmerizing morality play detailing the machinations of adultery and their deadly consequences.
95791|1|Of this fall's post-9/11, Iraq-conscious lineup, The Kingdom may be the most unobjectionable, accessible and, ultimately, most entertaining.
67113|1|Bruce Dern gives one of his best edgy performances as a Vietnam veteran recruited by the terrorists, while Robert Shaw, Marthe Keller and Fritz Weaver all impress their personalities on the action.
81868|0|Unfortunately, the screenplay by Ehren Kruger is littered with plot holes that reduce the story to a generic thriller formula.
55650|0|"Lat at night you ask yourself, ""How do films like this get made?"""
91364|1|Another comic love story that takes us inside a character's psyche, but Kaufman's rock-solid jokes are replaced by whimsy.
99640|0|Some of it just seems silly, which is fine for a family movie, of course, but there's silly and then there's silly. Kung Fu Panda is silly.
21934|1|Middle of the road Hitch but still terrific.
50062|0|Arctic build-up to laughable eye finale is overall time waster
92007|1|If you found Hannibal's brain cooking scene a tad too much, you will want to avoid Saw III; but if you are a fan of the gory versions of horror, this will be an iconic essential
42600|0|It attempts to take a Three's A Company situation and mix it together with a widower trying to raise three children. This is not cool.
60376|1|I haven't enjoyed a cheesy, over-acted B-movie as much since Eddie And The Cruisers.
91785|1|Although the game is not seen, it provides a kinetic, real-time, documentary-like backdrop for a story structured like a game itself, albeit one where neither compassion nor logic apply, and at which everyone loses.
102562|0|Enjoyable, silly and a wee bit whimsical. It's also treacherously predictable at times, the two leads lack chemistry and it has the token horrible Rob Schneider cameo.
41441|1|The greatest pleasure comes from seeing '70s veterans send themselves up.
24617|0|Decently (but no more) acted by Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson, this marriage on the rocks melodrama, based on Nora Ephron's memoir, is ultimately shallow and verbose.
59599|0|Director Lucky McKee has a knack for discomfiting material involving contact lenses and animal hospitals, but such moments are increasingly rare as he stretches his material.
41673|1|As a biopic, anti-Apartheid chronicle, the film is mediocre, but the young Denzel Washington is excellent, rendering an Oscar-nominated performance.
13067|1|Fried Green Tomatoes is an engaging if sentimental tale, charmingly handled by producer-turned-director Jon Avnet and flawlessly acted by its four female stars.
27268|1|The movie is a fairy tale, and writer Richard Curtis (Four Weddings and a Funeral) knows how much the public loves a fairy tale.
96566|0|Filled with painfully awkward men with painfully bad haircuts, I'm Reed Fish exhibits less energy than a sloth on Seconal.
57402|1|...Rogers's mouth never stops shut about the war between the sexes and how to win the battle.
9472|1|Even after 70 years, this extraordinarily entertaining romantic comedy/mystery is still fresh, and holds up to repeated viewings mostly thanks to William Powell and Myrna Loy's sparkling chemistry.
56123|1|"Sometimes a remake can be better than the original. This doesn't happen very often, but...Thus it is with Bret Ratner's remake of Michael Mann's ""Manhunter."""
58976|1|Any film as provocative and nervy as this one is bound to generate controversy...
56239|1|It looked really good when I was in grade school. Now it's beyond retro.
95594|1|An uneven black comedy-thriller that's nonetheless worth catching for Téa Leoni's bracingly sharp performance and the inspired idea of putting hitman Ben Kingsley into AA. Just focus on the well-etched characters and don't worry too much about the plot.
87438|0|For all the big themes Rent deals with -- love, death, injustice, community -- it still seems a bit superficial
88072|1|Erice meant his film as a sly social commentary, but his opinions are so well enveloped in the film's dreamy coming-of-age tapestry that moviegoers worldwide (especially younger ones) have embraced it.
2175|1|One of Bullock's best - has as much byte as it does bang
27256|1|The most enjoyable way to read this movie is as an elaborate -- though good-natured -- practical joke on Julia Roberts.
100333|1|Though the material is familiar, [director Celine] Sciamma has a light touch and avoids many teen-movie cliches. Her girls aren't hyperverbal -- in fact, they're the opposite, guarded and always listening for cues before they reveal themselves in words.
77376|1|A must-see for Fellini enthusiasts and a worthwhile investment for everyone else.
8673|1|One of the great MGM musicals.
40537|0|The dialogue has more pauses than a High School production of Samuel Beckett. And while that works up to a point, you find yourself wanting to grab the characters and shake them out of their introspective stupors.
2585|1|It's not John Cassavetes' Shadows (1959), but what Kevin Smith's Clerks, lacks in subtlety it makes up for in laughs
1947|1|Holds its own within the steadiness of the trilogy.
28058|0|Nobody escapes unscathed from the gimmicky script co-authored by blockbuster comedy writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel.
89669|0|If Over the Hedge aims solely to entertain, it does so in a way that's mildly amusing but mostly hackneyed. If it aims to instruct, it weakens its own argument with the plethora of product tie-ins.
68590|1|a masterpiece that still packs a punch and whose standard-bearing genius remains untarnished.
36861|0|It's a mission De Palma shouldn't have chosen to accept.
47137|1|At all kinds of points, one has the feeling that Schlesinger's film is running away from him; but there's also the impression of a talent energetic enough to risk even the occasional howling blunder.
75752|1|Vintage Groucho, Harpo and Chico.
48525|1|True, there are traces of hokum and contrivance plots that will drive you batty at times, but Chelson delivers a film that is occasionally smart about its airheaded premise
46934|1|Pleasantly quirky comedy-drama.
54723|0|While you're watching this creamed-crime caper -- as unnecessarily murky as it is unoriginal -- you may find yourself wondering What is Cletis Tout? When it's finally over, the only question left is Why is Cletis Tout?
87322|1|If there is any lesson the makers of Syriana want us to absorb, it is that we should trust no one where power and money are concerned.
25433|1|It's often impossible to distinguish what's meant to be cartoonish from what's meant to be dramatic, but the confusion seems appropriately adolescent.
20105|1|One of the best series in the genre.
74587|1|The sheer presence of Garbo in this startlingly profound performance it completely and utterly mesmerizing, and an experience that can't really be done justice on the small screen.
63370|0|They may be archetypes of my peers, but it's really hard to even care.
54011|0|A characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie.
10195|0|What's really disappointing is the undistinguished animation: the film looks and plays more like the Disney shorts than the Disney features.
94500|1|"Curtis Hanson's film concerns itself with wage-makers' addictive pathological itch, desperate hustles and poker's cult of very strange personalities. Its most striking ""Tin Cup"" kinship: Vindication and victory don't always arrive together."
50442|1|Mr. Spacey and his estimable supporting cast bring skill and commitment to their roles; they respect their characters and demand as much from the audience.
81957|0|Is Lee satirizing something? Is this all a metaphor for something? Or is it just a heavy-handed mess, full of non-sequiturs? My vote is for the latter.
90675|0|Though there are enough interesting moments to keep it refreshing, Mr. Helm's script never rises above its conceit to reach the giddy Charlie Kaufman heights to which it aspires.
44885|0|Scarily awful -- this spoof horror franchise needs a stake driven through its heart, and quick...
41682|0|a Hollywood whitewashing of a potentially explosive story
49647|0|All semblance of plausibility is extracted, leaving a cast of TV actors to struggle with a plot with more gaps than an eight-year-old's grin.
85420|1|It isn't quite right to call Happy Endings a comedy, although the film does have plenty of dark humour. It's more of an urban fairy tale, and a positive urban fairy tale about the pursuit of love.
91396|1|Old-fashioned, sweet, but ultimately disposable family fare with echoes of better films from Toy Story to The Iron Giant.
53451|0|Joyless dreck, another dumbed-down teen comedy fired out of Hollywood with all the crudeness of a spitball.
7748|1|Trainspotting is a look to a better world while you're down and stuck in the mud. [Full review in Spanish]
69784|0|Torque is like a third generation copy of a bad videotape.

22921|1|If the rest of John Waters' Pecker was as funny as its first half-hour is, it might have been one of the all-time greats.

36652|0|Danny DeVito is the only cast member who succeeds in making something out of the movie's nothing of a screenplay.
49850|1|The faces of its inarticulate characters tell the story, and Majidi has put some amazing faces on the screen.
85734|1|A wonderful bittersweet dramedy that deserves to be seen.
101471|1|By fashioning its stories to get in as much impact as possible, mostly from the stark ugliness of their realities and their bold endings, the movie achieves a satisfying level of effectiveness.
58561|0|Without an intriguing adversary for Capt. Jean-Luc Picard and crew, it's all for naught.
12523|0|This rickety empty-feeling production has a script & stars that deliver lots of edgy little subtle jokes. The dialogue is crisp and crunchy, but the romance is nearly absent.
30257|1|A pleasant comedy with a good heart and amiable characters.

66628|1|It's funny, it's heartfelt, and it just rocks!
68460|1|Enjoyable if not one of the great Astaire-Rogers musicals, Roberta received nomination for the Best Song Oscar (Lovely to Look At).
88806|0|even if it offers Lohan her first role as a grown-up, places her in a corporate New York, and contrives a scene in which she gets to wear a dress owned by Sarah Jessica Parker, the sex in this city never seems to get beyond first base.
16688|1|A mesmerizing drama about the potent force of small incremental doses of hope.
69496|1|Corny and crude at times, but effective in its single-minded pursuit of laughs.
19238|1|The film is anonymously directed, functionally paced and hysterical at times, though it seduces as a hot-blooded spectacle that stitches emotional detail onto the epic canvas of history.
41249|0|It is full of bang-on melodramatics and simple, romanticized characters with carefully supplied motivations.
36225|0|Spurious transcendence and underlined symbolism

99108|0|The ending is as baffling as anything preceding it - giving rise to a genre conflict situation.
75652|0|Amid an overbearing story that suffocates its humor, Chicks' increasingly repetitive and tired jokes reek of a comedy on autopilot.
28471|1|Better than average Castle thriller with a wonderfully campy Vincent Price.
41506|0|The film's style is as doggedly ordinary as its story is preposterous.
52580|1|It is as unlikely that you have ever seen another movie like The Piano Teacher as it is that you will ever want to see another one.
90375|1|A wonderful message movie, warts-an-all!
22397|1|If Colin Firth and Kristin Scott Thomas firing snarky bon mots at people for 90 minutes doesn't sound entertaining, I don't know what to tell you.
26803|1|A great Indiana Jones movie without Indiana Jones.
9217|0|The film's sole dramatic preoccupations are with broad physical comedy and unrealistically offbeat characterizations; a few moments of nominal pathos are really just structural pauses in the joke series.
21110|1|A very frank and gritty story about two brothers.
7887|0|It's a little better than the godawful script it was based on, but not by much.
87023|0|Ironically, this therapeutic romantic comedy ultimately suffers from too many unexplored issues.

93366|1|...scientifically implausible, even laughable, but emotionally it's irresistible...
55743|1|Son of Bride misses greatness by a hair.
82566|1|Because Welles is arguably the most magnetic and mercurial of all American directors, the film would be interesting on any grounds, but it is also impressive because of the long raft sequence, shown here in an essentially complete state.
56631|1|Cleaving to a child's-eye-view of a time of significant social change, documentarist-turned-feature director Julie Gavras elicits excellence from Kervel as the stubborn schoolgirl struggling to deal with the lack of certainties in her new lifestyle.
492|0|Never illuminates the true spirit of learning, instead the movie opts for bribing students to read pretentious Bob Dylan lyrics.
31017|0|Nighthawks, an aggressively shallow police thriller pitting New York undercover cops against international terrorists.

52275|0|This is a good movie in spurts, but when it doesn't work, it's at important times.
24870|1|If you want some light and charming entertainment and are attuned to Zeffirelli's rather conventional approach to the medium, then you can have a very good time.
22462|0|The end result is still short of a winning hand, since the screenplay is so utterly predictable.
61895|0|Dillon is so eager to show the duality of Cambodia, the grace and the grime, that he sacrifices major story elements to do so.
83503|0|Amusingly bad horror flick
11002|1|David Mamet's play about the wheelings and dealings of real-estate salesmen gets dedicated playing from a splendid cast, but gains nothing by the transfer from stage to screen.
46230|1|Surprisingly not-awful cable-flick action-fest!
60574|1|The friction between [Martin's] button-down lawyer, Peter Sanderson, and ghetto-fabulous fugitive Charlene Morton (Queen Latifah) produces dazzling comic sparks in an otherwise stale set-up.

56931|1|Dumb fun, thy name is Ashton.

401|0|It certainly has the courage of its convictions.

1550|1|It's a nice change of pace to see a strong, competent woman in a John Woo film. If you've never heard of the man, this is your chance to see what all the buzz is about.
98576|1|Adams is adorable as the wide-eyed would-be starlet, with McDormand spot-on as the sensible half of the odd couple. A delightfully frivolous screwball comedy.

6918|1|It glows with sorrowful humor in its look at two people who seem just right for each other but don't have time on their side.

42112|0|For all the brilliant production design that went into this thing, you'd have thought they'd remember to include some warm-blooded characters with expressions on their faces.
64815|1|These faults, if faults they be, may well be outweighed by the beauty of the ballet sequences and music, by the skill with which Mr Powell always uses colour, and by Miss Shearer's endearing charm.
11608|1|Utterly irresistible, this may be a cornball celebration of the art and social history of cinema, but it's also a thoughtful memoir of more innocent days, when pleasures rarely came cheaply or instantly.
96684|0|A problematic period movie, Silk is anything but finely spun. Unaided by lacklusture performances from the leads, director Francois Girard seems more interested in crafting a beautiful travelogue than he does a moving melodrama.

54279|0|While formulaic and predictable, the parallel human and animal plots offer enough dream sequences, guest star appearances, musical interludes and holiday spirit to keep both children and adults moderately entertained.

83617|0|Diesel has amply shown his star presence already, and he may even have a flair for comedy (if Hulk Hogan did, why shouldn't he?), but he gets no chance to prove it here.
35811|1|All the film's energy goes into Ian Holm's stellar performance.
5294|1|It's beautiful.
38623|1|"There are many love stories folded into this film's enjoyably meandering two hours, but ""Tampopo"" is above all about the romance of food, and the joyous, agonizing devotion and hard work required to tease out its manifold mysteries."
21857|1|Brad Anderson's stylish and original romantic comedy features a wonderful performance from Hope Davis.
33211|0|This is every bit as insipid as it sounds, but it's also surprisingly innocent and has a most unexpected sweetness.
75294|1|Arguably Terence Davies' masterpiece, this poetic evocation of the director's childhood in Liverpool is highly stylized and original in conception and execution.
34759|1|Terrific self-spoofing swashbuckler. Hard to beat
60764|1|A sweeping and at times stirring biblical epic.
89189|1|Fans of Bresson's work will find him at his finest here. Mouchette is as pure as any film to come out of the '60s.
20531|0|Takes us all the way to the rim of space only to bog us down in a talky melodrama whipped up out of mad scientists and haunted houses.
71415|1|A surprisingly bittersweet love story at heart, Eternal Sunshine values the sum of experience, which in this case means a thorns-and-all openness to romantic possibilities.
55601|0|a film as bloodily pointless as the current conflict in Iraq that it so unsubtly allegorises.
12303|1|Like Sir Larry's, this remains Branagh's best movie and although less spirited and more actorish than its predecessor, it has a modern feel and a grittier tone to it, notably in the battle scenes.
10004|1|As fabulous and fantastic as anything he has ever done in cartoons is Walt Disney's 'live action' movie made from Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.
46494|1|The running gag is that [this film about advertising] takes its own high-concept formula of a yuppie's just desserts and whips it up with more tang than any consumer could want.
70991|1|Director Wolfgang Becker can claim the film's depth as its greatest achievement. He has taken an absurd situation, a silly premise, and added weight to the humor.
67637|1|Darkman is funny, but it's no joke; it's the work of a man who underlines the conventions of adventure stories and horror because he enjoys them, and knows that even when rendered tongue-in-cheek, they're timeless.
75123|1|A scorching drama about the war between the sexes.
50766|1|Just as the recent Argentine film Son of the Bride reminded us that a feel-good movie can still show real heart, Time of Favor presents us with an action movie that actually has a brain.
7634|1|It's certainly an astounding film for its purely spectacular terms.
99707|0|It fizzles instead of sizzles.
38079|0|A crashing bore.
19461|1|With the skill of a practiced surgeon, Redford gradually peels away the protective layers of his characters, exposing their flaws, their darkest fears and ultimately, their innermost feelings.
9834|1|A thoughtful if somewhat heavy-handed medical thriller that benefits enormously from Hackman's involvement.
18586|1|Christopher Nolan, the promising writer-director behind Following and Memento, makes an elegant and assured transfer to big-budget, star-driven film-making with Insomnia.
75421|1|Susan Sarandon, as Hattie, is seamless and flawless, not to mention at her shapliest best.
75046|1|too odd to dismiss and often truly funny
6995|1|Although dated, there is a brute edginess to this popular slice of formula odd coupling.
2467|0|Overbearing and, unsurprisingly, mostly forgotten.
53929|0|Mildly entertaining, but not nearly the campy self-lampooning it could have been.
99820|0|It's a great idea. A silent, unknown killing machine knocking people off while a science teacher tries to figure out why. But it just didn't work.
16906|1|Both sweeping and intimate, a lovely evocation of changing cultures and enduring family ties.
86036|1|It may be a cheesy lark, but life bubbles through the cheese.
22246|1|Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt is one of his grimmest and most impressive movies.
39178|1|"Still something appealing about it. It's ""so bad it's good"", if you will. That could be the fittingly cast Helen Slater as Supergirl and her alter-ego Linda Lee, it could be the fun escapist fare of a film such as this or it could be the fact that it's t"
98613|0|A mannered comedy of manners that, in its eagerness to be all things to all people, ends up being nothing much of anything.
47964|1|Using archival footage of Europe at the brink of war, Harris conjures up a moving piece of film journalism, defining love, loss, separation and a good-news moment in what was a bad-news world.
53696|1|Though Don Murray is the only actor to get an Oscar nod, the main reason to see Joshua Logan's serio comedy, based on Inge's play, is Marilyn Monroe, who shines as the country girl with big Hollywood aspirations.
94275|0|Hitchcock would turn in his grave.
120|0|It's pablum, but at least it's not poison.
48073|0|This isn't a serious movie, despite Denzel Washington in full eruption and giving his calloused lines more weight and authority than they deserve.
51073|1|A deviant topical comedy which is funny from start to finish.
19054|1|It's all very stiff-upper-lip stuff, but 70 years after it was made, it still remains a very rousing, moving experience.
53947|0|Too celebratory of Woo's good guy-versus-bad guy, buddy-buddy ethos of action movies to rise above the limitations of the genre, and too obsessed with its own seriousness to be a truly 'serious' film.
93024|1|As a critic, I don't always have the luxury of choosing everything I see. And a lucky thing, too, because director Susanne Bier's After the Wedding is making a strong argument that my instincts about Danish cinema are wrong wrong wrong.
47347|0|an experimental curiosity at best
2481|1|An important new director announces his arrival.
16917|1|If you've ever had parents, then you can relate to this movie.
32838|0|The film goes up in flames when its '50s morality rears its ugly head.
84378|1|"The Frisco Kid is, all pratfalls and tuchus jokes aside, the quintessential ""Torah ""movie."
39292|0|The bottom line is that Highlander: Endgame should be a lot more fun than it is.
51860|1|Skillfully weaves both the elements of the plot and a powerfully evocative mood combining heated sexuality with a haunting sense of malaise.
25329|0|In the end, however, it's let down by one easy laugh too many.
100804|0|Comes down to exactly the same type of heroic finale they're supposed to be parodying in the first place. You bettah off renting Rescue Dawn.
54979|1|It's an offbeat treat that pokes fun at the democratic exercise while also examining its significance for those who take part.
13431|0|This disappointing teen comedy from director Martha Coolidge is another entry in the rash of teens-goofing-with-science films.
85006|0|None of the leads convince or engage, and supporting characters are either gay stereotypes, routine little sisters or functional best friends.
74937|1|Every independent filmmaker with a micro-budget and mega-dreams should see Baadasssss.
96892|1|Traz o peso de tragédia grega que Woody Allen buscou com sucesso apenas moderado em O Sonho de Cassandra.
26684|0|Even pretensions toward the humorous and hip cannot save this blood-drenched film from its innate tastelessness!
37216|1|Has its moments...a second-rate screenplay is given a first-rate treatment by underrated director/cinematographer Peter Hyams.
14985|1|Reiner benefits from divine intervention from no less than Miss M herself. Bette Midler flings the usual zingers with fang-baring zeal in a part that plays to her brassy strengths.
63572|1|Charlotte Rampling is engaging in this intriguing little whodunit that seems more intent on exposing internal paranoia than it does on real world murder.
91865|1|Two terrific performances cap this interesting historical perspective on ruthless dictator Idi Amin.
40784|1|It's a twisting, witty, and wise crime-boxing story about the hunt for a huge diamond and a prizefighter who can't take a fall.
69257|1|The influence of American genre films, especially the gangster films, is never more pronounced than in this highly entertaining drama.
85190|1|Rize is full of sugar-rush adrenaline, but it also has the presence of mind to cool our enthusiasm enough to pierce through to its issues' core.
4025|1|While Lee fails to impose sufficient structure on his material, expertly drawn performances help vividly to evoke the family and street life of an era untroubled by crack or drive-by shootings.
31825|1|Not a bad thriller, as far as thrillers that aren't very good, go.
45343|1|While you'll telegraph its plot twist ten minutes before it actually happens, you'll be too wrapped up in the performances to care.
9555|1|One of the finest screwball comedies ever.
68204|1|Remains effectively squirmy, gruesome, and even prescient nearly forty years after its release.
35125|1|a story about a mere class clown becoming a man at the gates of Hell.
6735|1|A bit of a mixed bag. Some eye popping animation, chock full of nudity, gore, and alien landscapes. The classic soundtrack is what makes it most worthwhile when the stories fall flat
13479|1|Rightfully a ballgame classic, this is sentimental nonsense, sure, but charmingly so.
90540|1|Here's a conundrum: an animated movie that is pitched at kids but is far more suitable for teenagers and adults.
34477|1|Daughters of the Dust is a film with a lot on its mind, but one that wears its agendas with lyrical lightness.
92308|1|Three very intelligent actors -- Rickman, Moss and Sigourney Weaver -- elevate what could have been cloying into something better than the script's idiosyncratic bent.
28545|0|Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker, who share both writing and directorial credits, become so desperate for laughs that the jokes descend to a much cruder level.
44988|1|a non-too-subtle satire on ... the crime genre, with especially good pokes at Jules Dassin's heist masterpiece Rififi
79189|1|A mildly amusing comedy fantasy that was extremely popular during WWII and later served as the basis for Warren Beatty's 1978 Heaven Can Wait.
97595|1|It leaves you wishing the oddball couple well.
24511|1|...probably the most effective of the bunch...
95646|1|"""It's a playful study of Arctic life, starring a polar bear cub, its prey, and a tagalong fox -- with the inevitable dramatic moments when bear meets walrus."""
5536|0|A Western for people that hate Westerns.
55479|1|The seriousness with which Barbershop II treats its political conscience offers an unexpected weight to what's essentially a big screen sitcom.
52118|1|Hill is very much in the American grain, the inheritor of the Ford-Hawks-Walsh tradition of artful, understated action film making.
24033|1|A sparkling light comic mystery of the kind that Hollywood doesn't make anymore -- pity.
8381|1|As filmmaking and storytelling, 'The Godfather' remains a bravura piece of work, its set pieces, dialogue and performances entrenched cinematic icons.
91966|1|A decent enough calling-card picture that swaggers even as it stumbles.
48040|1|the plot is so amusingly contrived and outlandish in its coincidences that no one could ever mistake it for anything resembling reality
42205|0|An embarrassment for Brendan Fraser. Consider this surreal comedy attempt a career hurdle that Fraser has since cleared.
7955|0|There's a certain amateurish quality about Harriet the Spy, but it's more the TV-trained grownups behind the camera...than the pint-sized thespians in front of it.
86294|0|A high-octane, indisputably terrible piece of futuristic silliness.
83029|1|Much of the allure of the film comes from Cameron's easygoing, rather unscientific approach to the project.
29220|1|"A glorious rebuke to all this summer's recycled, effects-ridden, laboriously ""fun"" Hollywood disappointments piled along the wayside like so many crashed cars."
30745|0|It feels a lot more like a cheap shot than a tribute.
16728|0|Stripes will keep potential felons off the streets for two hours. Few people seem to be asking, these days, that movies do more.
50499|1|Losey's use of off-kilter camera angles and an ornamental convex mirror helps to emphasise the stifling architecture of the building while offering eerie portents of things to come.
15214|0|The story offers nothing original.
39296|0|You feel sorry for the real-life dancers on screen here...
59143|0|If... Martin Lawrence and Adam Sandler [were] in the same movie, it might... create an anti-comedy field so strong that both their careers would be sucked into the vortex...
61689|1|kick ass, but in a very computer-in-the-90s kindofaway...
3491|1|Originally told and surprisingly funny.
29377|1|Plenty fun: as per the Jackie Chan standard, it's total nonsense, but unpretentiously entertaining and occasionally ingenious. [Blu-ray]
74500|1|Beautifully photographed historical drama from John Ford.
75966|1|An unwieldy hybrid of historical allegory and supernatural mystery.
87387|1|For those like me who are outside but sympathetic to the faith, it looks like another handsomely made, good-natured and high-spirited family movie, which is dramatically stymied through being locked within school grounds.
25451|0|No amount of slick style and visual invention can make up for a contrived and unsatisfying wrap-up.
11013|1|Brilliantly acted and written, it's one of the best ensemble pieces of its particular decade.
22378|1|It's a more than adequate though primitive murder mystery story that's enhanced by a series of marvelous technical innovations for its time.
43189|1|Some of the hostile reactions to Wallace and his movie machine may seem heavy-handed, but the film reminds us that China had been exploited by Western culture, making the opposition a bit more palatable.
3507|0|Those familiar with Alcoholics Anonymous' 12-step recovery programme may bond in sympathy. The sentimentality, however, doesn't play.
69540|0|A mish-mashed historical drama sunk by its flattened tone... on the one hand clamorous and eventful but ultimately also quite tedious and tiresome.
57874|0|The sincere idiocy of this film really has to be seen to be appreciated -- not that I think there is any need for you to see, or appreciate, it.
486|1|Pfeiffer has a lot of good moments as Johnson.
70878|0|Cage is a magnetic presence, for sure, but little things -- like making an actual connection with his costar -- are beyond him.
8428|0|You can constantly feel The Time Traveler's Wife reaching for emotional depth, yet it never gets there.
30165|1|Though far less operatic and satisfying than Leone's later work, his first spaghetti Western with Eastwood still looks stylish, if a little rough at the edges.
30406|1|Some of it makes you wince, but a lot of it is great fun.
87554|0|It's clearly conceived solely as a star vehicle for the ubiquitous Usher and his washboard abs, with plot coherence and originality coming in somewhere lower in the pecking order.
81481|1|For once, it makes sense that the battered wife always returns to the abusive spouse, even if we don't believe his promises ('I've changed') any more than hers ('I'm never going back').
99478|0|Any hopes you might be holding out for a smart, sophisticated political satire will immediately be squashed at the sight of Dan Aykroyd on the toilet.
9831|1|A spine-tingling suspense machine that holds you captivated from beginning to end. A much underrated, overlooked thriller.
72905|1|''The Fourth Protocol'' is an entertaining, better-than-average variation on a format that has long since stopped offering anything new.
81370|1|There aren't a lot of plot complications in Springtime, a remake of a celebrated 1948 Chinese film of the same name. It's the way Tian tells his story that impresses.
83892|0|The comic side isn't really that comic.
28653|0|A long, teasing trailer for a film not yet made.
4227|0|Bertolucci's epic is a disappointment.
45952|1|A top-notch thriller with genuine surprises and a great, affluent atmosphere.
58917|1|"So you say to yourself, this Fat City is pretty damn realistic, even if you know in your heart that ""realistic"" and Hollywood should not be printed on the same page-otherwise paper ignites. Still, you're marveling at it."
71475|1|Meditation on loneliness and isolation not highly entertaining but offers food for thought
82413|0|At the end of this weak comedy is a strange and touching scene in which Bill Cosby and his childhood pals from Philadelphia, now elderly men, gather at the grave of Albert Robertson, the real-life inspiration for Cosby's bighearted Fat Albert.
225|1|"_""Can you imagine what this man would have been had he ever been loved?"""
17389|0|If you really hate your kids, pack them off to this slapdash farce, whose only funny moment is the PC disclaimer at the end about the Disney company's humanist concern for blind people.
13871|1|Silly and bloody, but at times very effective.
12614|1|Arguably the goriest movie ever made
56691|1|A film geek's dream movie. 90 minutes, one take.
80822|0|it won't gain Rodney any respect whatsoever
95080|1|Alex Holdridge has written and directed a sweet, funny little indie movie.
95522|1|Even in the canon of high school flicks, Charlie Bartlett seems slight, but like its wide-eyed protagonist, it ultimately wins you over on the strength of its puppy-dog appeal.
68363|1|At once severe and incandescent, rigorously distanced yet close enough to touch the lenses
55076|0|Is it as bad as all that? Oh yes.
76592|0|The most telling parallel is that between Kracklite, with his perpetual stomach upset, and director Greenaway: Both are pretentious gasbags.
95160|0|For all of 1408's shortcomings, all that's really needed to lift it a level is some decent scares, but one or two spooky moments just isn't enough.
44608|1|Sure it's a guilty pleasure watching stunt drivers put flashy state-of-the-art streetcars through impossibly daring maneuvers, but it's a happy indulgence nonetheless.
5358|0|Putting Mr. Shore under the authority of a pretty female drill sergeant (Lynn Whitfield) is, along with that bad haircut, one of this film's only ways of getting laughs.
28404|0|A valentine to sex, drugs, and cutting school.
75921|1|By keeping the focus on the humanity, Rupert Wyatt makes a strong debut as a writer/director here, and his film's got a great sense of low-budget style.
5564|1|Terrific Woody Allen thrill comedy with the great Keaton co-starring as a plus.
30954|1|While Re-Animator fails as a faithful adaptation of Lovecraft, it is an incredibly demented movie in its own right that combines a plethora of downright disgusting grand guignol with disturbing black humor.
47503|1|...this film earns its laughs. Sure, there are some jokes that involve bodily functions, but at no point does anyone get a penis stabbed into the side of their head.
70564|1|Isn't horrible and isn't a classic either.
42135|1|It has my favorite characters and it's kind of like a mystery.
77886|0|The script is a long string of awful verbal and visual puns, and the animation, while colorful, is a big step back from the Shrek films (and nowhere near Pixar's league).
54762|1|The 'star-studded' cast of familiar faces is one of the conventions of disaster movies that writers Cohen and Fred Freeman have stuck to
9797|1|Fierce and emotionally resonant action-drama, anchored by four smart performances.
58692|0|Why did Scorsese spend three decades thirsting to make this movie? It's nowhere clear on the screen.
70959|0|Sick.
53513|1|Director Stephen Frears and screenwriter Hanif Kureishi are better at depicting a new milieu than in making an important or innovative statement.
19508|1|No-wonder Jack was so keen to land this role. It was simply perfect for him.

20981|1|Popeye is a sustained eureka.

48951|1|Directed with enough (borrowed) style by Marcelo Pineyro that we barely notice its lack of original ideas.
22780|0|Absolutely implausible, silly and thin. A shame for Robert Redford...and one more Moore's bad film.
46059|1|"A rollicking, thrilling and funny police picture that makes ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and its sequel look as if they were photographed in slow motion."
42781|1|Spike Lee's Oscar-nominated documentary, about one of the defining moments of the civil rights movement, balances personal and painful memories of many witnesses with a poignantly political expose of the event, the murder of four innocent girls.

64748|1|There's a surprise ending that helps make this one of Ealing's darkest comedies.
14372|1|Starting from a point of delirious excess, the film leaps into dark and virtually uncharted territory to soar like a comet.

5745|0|The intrinsic failure of Alan Zweibel and Andrew Scheinman's script is that it tips its hand from the start.
33832|0|Hooper's sophomore effort, which had a bigger budget but is lesser-known, repeats the same basic formula.
23587|1|The style is devilishly flamboyant and gleefully indulgent; every shot is full of amazing stuff. The edits dance and twist. It's a glam movie about a glam subject.
76436|1|Bresson outdoes nearly every escape film you've ever seen, using little more than the face of Francois Leterrier and elemental off-screen sound.
61655|0|Mostly, it exults in its inspired potential rather than any brilliant results.
1523|0|Political comedy morphs into attempted thriller in this confused, fitfully entertaining film.

2577|0|Very, very disappointing Stuart Gordon effort
30897|1|Genevieve Bujold puts in one of the strongest performances of her career in this well-done thriller.

30927|1|A satisfying follow-up that retains the same macabre yet spirited tone.
55681|1|Classy family classic of the old school.
40818|0|The film is simply Footloose, just trade Binoche for Bacon and chocolate for dancing.
51076|0|This cloying, voices-from-the-other-side story is hell.
34295|0|Too often murky and with too many characters, the film works best when the director focuses attention firmly on the leads and their actions.
21540|1|Points to the Henson team for trying to broaden the scope of their creatures -- and there's little denying that this particular flick still seems to hold up pretty darn well.
39067|1|Bernie Mac is the best way to close out the show. He lunges straight into the audience's face, politically incorrect and proud of it.
31001|1|If you're looking for a senseless good time that goes a long way in terms of keeping you entertained, then this Piranha package may just be everything you've been hoping to sink your teeth into.

36021|1|It needs to be seen and appreciated, like a serpent in a glass cage.
94697|0|As morale boosters go, Larry the Cable Guy is no Bob Hope, and it's hard to reconcile the contradiction of an overtly tasteless movie that doesn't want to offend the troops.
43597|1|A lumbering monstrosity of a movie with all manner of preposterous hairstyles and improbable fashions. Worth seeing -- once anyway -- at least as wayward legend.
42711|1|Manhunter ushered in the age of empathy for the devil.
47757|0|Brazenly exploitative stuff, stirring in anything which has done the business in kids' movies previously, this, of course, should have its target audience laughing like drains.
65412|0|So bad in a special gay, L.A. way that it's almost an inept classic of its kind.
93296|0|Grisly crime scene snaps accompany the story, which makes Miami Vice look like a tea party and Florida like hell on earth.
19693|1|"The late John Hughes' finest hour (he didn't have many, despite a prolific output), The Breakfast Club was the best of the so-called ""Brat Pack"" features as well as a seminal film for many who came of age in the 1980s."

25044|0|The sad fact is that the duck gets lost in what becomes a special effects film suspiciously reminiscent of Ghostbusters.
60880|1|The movie proves the perfect showcase for 3D. I can't say that it does the same for Fraser.

403|1|Grim yet compelling, downbeat but not really depressing, Mike Figgis' multi-nuanced portrait of an alcoholic, splendidly played by Oscar winner Nicholas Cage, is easily is most accomplished and haunting picture.
76739|1|A great vein of noir tropes, greatly mined
28619|1|Middling star vehicle that wastes its director's talents.
83983|1|Finely made John Schlesinger film is worth another look.

37778|1|A sardonic and explosive crooks-on-the-lam saga in the tradition of Bonnie and Clyde.
57194|0|The piranha attack scenes are handled with minimal grace, giving us plenty of nice, long looks at just how fake the props are.

41735|1|Arguably Spielberg's strangest object.
39298|1|It might be formulaic and predictable, but there's plenty of appeal in this energy-filled film about reaching for your dreams. Set in the world of dance, the story is as much about passion as it is about ballet and hip hop.
66548|1|Its baroque sadism and sexism hasn't aged well, but it still packs a visceral kick.
69253|1|The story is by turns comic and pathetic, often flashing midstream from one mood to the other, and Aznavour's performance as the wounded hero is a masterstroke of casting.
20128|1|Gremlins hosts the perfect blend of Capraesque Christmas spirit, humorously tainted by stinging horror and hilarious offbeat comedy.

9108|1|It's an elegant production, beautifully photographed and designed like a dream house shrouded in mourning, but it also favors the pictorial over the cinematic and surface over subtext.

6253|0|It doesn't help matters much that director Thomas Schlamme pays homage to great marital murder mysteries of the past, mostly because the attempts to borrow from the classics are so halfhearted.

78170|1|A haunting, riveting film that's as self-serving as it is revelatory. It's movie-making as therapy, and I hope it worked.
22310|1|The formula of an innocent thrust into a nightmare would fascinate Hitch for decades to come, but here he packs the tale with strong characters and important details.

3323|1|It's easier to take this movieish virus thriller once you accept Dustin Hoffman as a legit action hero.
98214|0|Larry The Cable Guy is a cancerous boil on the ass of comedy, but it's still sort of shocking how little effort he puts into his movies.
18583|1|Not as audacious as Memento, Christopher Nolan's first studio feature is nevertheless a confident and intelligent thriller that demonstrates a canny ability to fuse his own concerns with guilt, subjective experience and narrative to a mainstream package.

90954|0|It has a few funny bits here and there, but they're deeply mired in the seen-it-all-beforeness of the film.
21668|0|This sequel doesn't quite have the heart of the first Air Bud.
20242|1|It's a lovely, rootin' tootin' cowboy romp with a superbly suspenseful runaway train finale, and an apt closer that permits the excitement to continue on beyond the screen. It was an utter joy in 1990, and again in 2010.
41963|1|I'm not a big fan of horror films, but as they go this isn't a bad one.
20328|1|This animated feature based on Felix Salten's book about the coming of age of a fawn and his various forest friends (including the beloved Thumper) does convey some of the primal emotional power of Disney's features during this period.

97963|0|Critics have comically dubbed it Zorba the Pope.
67243|1|Deeply affecting in the moment, but I'm not sure that Garbus draws much in the way of larger conclusions.
86872|1|Freshness aside, Loggerheads is beautifully performed (especially by Hunt and Harper), and the script is finely attuned to the nuances of communication that has nothing to do with words.
3993|1|In a film that opens with the sight of a waving American flag, subtlety may not be foremost on anyone's mind. But Mr. Ford's wary intelligence does wonders for a potentially one-dimensional character.
95430|1|Simpsons fans will love it unreservedly, I was amused and passably entertained. It's better if less daring than the South Park movie and sharper if less poignant than the first Rugrats one.
50474|1|Relentlessly depressing and cynical, and although it was well-made, its cruelty made it an uncomfortable experience.

16645|0|Wonderland remains too subjective and doesn't probe deep enough.
96690|1|It is interesting and not riveting, lovely and not luxurious, good and not great. Some may even find it boring. It certainly is repetitive.

96695|0|Silk isn't just bad. It's utterly mad.
70167|1|Early Capra screwball comedy appealing to Depression audiences both as escapist entertainment and as satire of the idle rich and celebration of the hardworking poor.
88325|1|There are hallucinatory sequences in Sergei Paradzhanov's 1964 film Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors when this eruptively colorful movie feels more like a folkloric tapestry sprung to life than a film about flesh-and-blood people.
1289|1|The political argument that ensues is pretty dull, but the battle scenes are the loudest and most convincing in years: Gibson has learned from Kurosawa in lending a clarifying thrust to what is, essentially, chaos.
7578|1|A constantly absorbing little chiller directed by the underrated Tom Holland (Fright Night, Child's Play).
42012|0|There's a vacancy in The Million Dollar Hotel, and it's between Wim Wenders' ears.

65429|1|Millennium Actress has more layers to it than the proverbial onion, but Kon's sure hand keeps things moving right along.
75462|1|Imamura composed The Eel with an artist's eye and takes his time, so don't expect a fast-paced American-style film.
76258|1|Marston never romanticizes, never goes for the easy cliche. He allows his hooks to pull at the film's center without revealing the lines that make his movie so gripping.
77965|1|Oh, man, they don't make 'em like this often. A film unabashedly for the nerds in the audience (God love us), this is the type of film you could inflict upon your enemies, watching them squirm as they stare at the screen.
78122|0|For the few lucky youngsters out there whose lives so far have not been touched by divorce, this movie may stir up illegitimate (or, at least, unnecessary worries). Such realism in an otherwise fantasy-based tale makes for an awkward combination.
36804|0|Vulgar for some parents, but teens will love.
31155|0|Trading Places is a comedy of unavoidable fits and starts.

12591|1|If sensation alone makes a movie work for you, then this one succeeds on those strengths every 15 seconds.
4588|1|Writer-director Richard Brooks' detached style allows for a non-exploitative presentation, and the contributions by cinematographer Conrad Hall and composer Quincy Jones are first-rate.
92196|0|Anderson's jumpy editing fails to cover up the fact that he only has 30 good minutes of material here.
97344|1|We could say that The Savages is a social-problem drama about senile dementia and nursing homes, but that's a little like saying The 400 Blows is about school truancy.

11004|1|As fierce as it is funny. Rarely does does a film sustain such a fever pitch of dramatic intensity. One of the very best of 1992.
17932|0|The fact is, just too many of the characters and plot points are right out of the stock room: the obligatory fat kid; the obligatory bully; the obligatory kid whose parents can't really afford Catholic school tuition ...
2594|1|A buoyant, bleakly funny comedy chronicling a day's worth of activity at two adjoining stores.
21112|0|Writers Charlie Haas and Tim Hunter (latter making his directing debut) seem intent on incorporating every conceivable adolescent and adult trauma into their script.

40940|0|Schabel's most recent work fails to move me. While the story of Reinaldo Arenas is tragic enough to be interesting (and Javier Bardem's performance sympathetic) the film as a whole simply seems long and indulgent.
79077|1|L'Atalante manages to be more modern than anything being made today.
2967|0|[Emma Thompson] is totally wasted in this movie.
29890|1|Go and see it again - and try not to giggle at the clipped accents.
96924|1|Tackles the hackneyed with the tender hand and heart of writer/director Michel Gondry.
18066|0|Time-travel cliches... dialogue that's neither self-mocking nor serious, and an ostentatious though not particularly exciting production design keep the movie from taking off.
16416|1|A film of real finesse, style and intelligence, an espionage thriller of the old school, with some modern technical embellishments.
86220|1|Jarecki reminds us that there is no reason to believe that U.S. supremacy is destined to last forever
52476|1|Mamet's morality tale about a tormented Jewish identity is sincere but unfortunately the film becomes earnest, turning Bobby and the other Jewish characters into self-righteous men; contrived plotting doesn't help either.
57799|1|Considerable excitement is whipped up in this suspense drama, and fans who go for tight action will find it entirely satisfactory.
67988|1|There has never been a medical drama quite like Lorenzo's Oil. With indelible fervor, it captures the will - the need - to heal.
43424|0|It's a trite cash-in designed to empty pockets, lazily slapped together with concert footage and phoney fly-on-the-wall snippets.
40006|0|[An] unholy mess of a flick.
29963|1|Forgotten for years along with its maker, writer/director Preston Sturges, Sullivan's Travels has only recently enjoyed a comeback and induction into classic status.
16806|1|All its dramatized elements, from its scripted dialogue to Harrelson's role as the naysaying cynic, can be seen as devices needed to bring a harrowing but humane story to a popular audience without watering down the very real horrors of a very real war.
38413|1|Skirts stalker cliches and grown-up-kid-in-a-man's-body caricatures.
32254|1|Hanks and the other guards' acting is impeccable as would be expected, but Duncan and his fellow prisoners are also disturbingly real.
95512|0|Charlie Bartlett is a poor man's Rushmore. There is a great film waiting to be made about psychiatry, anti-depressants and our youth, but this isn't it.
17264|1|While I admit the film does not impress me as much as it does most other people, there is no questioning its passion and excitement.
83508|1|As in any Tourneur horror film there are some unforgettably nightmarish sequences.
9612|1|It's a virulent portrait of an America in flux and decay, from the flag billowing near the graveyard at the start to its disturbing depiction of a lynch-mob mentality. But Night also transcends its period through sheer intensity.
79845|1|An extraordinary combination of observational comedy and technical virtuosity.
75759|1|Overlong but action-filled.
73074|0|Marginal effort.
43935|0|Tries hard to be charming, but succeeds only occasionally.
64776|0|Directed by Michael Mann. Starring Ian McKellan, Gabriel Byrne and Scott Glenn. Sounds good, right?
34691|1|A film with a documentary-like intensity and a sense of British reserve that makes it all the more moving.
81140|0|No one other than H.P. Lovecraft fans should bother.
6999|1|Stands with Midnight Run as one of the all-time great mismatched buddy movies.
78085|1|Von Trier is rejuvenating his mentor's imagination. He's also reminding him that art can 'catch the conscience' of the audience and the artist.
46364|1|This adaptation has its flaws, but what lingers is insulated Ben's inaction so juxtaposed with the persecution of Jonathan and then his father. The white man's willful ignorance doesn't just sustain but perpetuates a systemic, brutal, savage racism.
99949|1|This documentary about a famous family of nomadic surfers is fascinating not only because of the certifiable oddball patriarch, but also because of his endlessly creative offspring.
23763|1|One of the all-time greats is back on the big screen where it belongs.
66336|1|Come and See sounds like an invitation to a child's game. Nothing could be further from the truth.
73415|1|Penn's training in theater and live-TV drama (e.g. Playhouse 90) shows; the central performance is rehearsed into an anxious stir, every line matched to an actorly decision, a blocking cue.
94787|0|When you wake up after napping through this earnest timewaster, you'll feel relieved, but you won't know why. Here's a clue: Gracie can't bend it.
15739|1|"Instinctively self-reflexive, ""Contempt"" (""Le Mepris"") is one of Jean-Luc Goddard's brightest achievements"
24503|1|The best of the sequels. Explores the aftermath of Rocky's success.
40223|1|Once again, the tone is that of a giggly, sweetly knowing, megabucks slumber party.
98034|1|Given how thoroughly all the subtext spells out the message, then, it seems unnecessary to make the actual text so raw, grotesque and graphic.
59159|0|The jokes are so tired and irritating in the film, I found myself anticipating the funny gags from the trailers because those were the only ones that were remotely humorous.
96063|1|A real kick in the gut
85949|0|This is a screenplay so unbelievably bad that not even two very fine young actors and a director known for his knack for suspense can salvage it.
10818|1|After nearly a half century, the film's influence is still overwhelming and obvious.
21819|0|"It's all handled so poorly that it comes off as more ghoulish than anything else, although those who find the word ""bong"" instantly entertaining and are easily distracted by the presence of flickering images may be amused."
74744|0|Well-observed but shapeless mainstream romantic comedy that reminds one of Moonstruck.
30384|1|Awesome, hypnotic storytelling, Fitzcarraldo finds this director working in top form
28963|0|...a cathedral of cliches. Can a church sue a movie?
61576|1|One breathtaking moment of clarity between Eugene Levy's Mitch and Catherine O'Hara's Mickey gives way to an anticipated kiss during which you can practically sense the characters' hearts thumping and their fictional contemporaries rooting for them.
1461|1|A quietly triumphant experience.
61449|0|Nicholson wears his devilish grin from his first scene to last, and one has to assume that's his reaction to the enormous size of his paycheck and not the material.
34637|1|Lacks the warm wit of the original movie, but hey, the old-school Muppets were a funny bunch of freaks!
94935|1|O estilo mockumentary confere charme a esta animação, que também se beneficia da dublagem perfeita de Bridges e de uma técnica impressionante (a animação de fluidos é fabulosa).
79067|1|"A seminal, vastly entertaining musical of the early Depression era and a showcase of the eccentric genius of Busby Berkeley in highlights like ""We're in the Money."""
52126|1|A superb, nitty-gritty retelling of the story of the James-Younger gang.
11863|0|Bizarrely overrated vanity piece that might appeal to fans.
64182|0|Because the majority of scenes are drawn out and obviously improvised, this disjointed and rambling confection will have limited appeal to others.
29154|0|The baseball sequences are fabulous, not least because Costner looks and moves like a real player a rarity for actors in sports movies... But the love story, a five-year off-and-on affair, is little more than a sop to Costner's romantic faithful.
100047|1|'Kit Kittredge' presents a wonderful role model for pre-teen girls -- and a humanistic history lesson about the Great Depression for all viewers.
35679|0|Sex, violence and secrecy can make a volatile on-screen combination, but not this time.
91892|1|Genuinely enlivening
95880|0|An asinine chunk of Mormonsploitation that mixes historical fact with fictional romance and bald-faced anti-Mormon prejudice.
20649|1|O visual oitentista e os efeitos visuais datados acabam contribuindo para o charme do filme, que ainda consegue divertir.
37309|1|Doesn't have the narrative strength of the first in the trilogy but individual scenes are still brilliant and each ingredient in just perfect, cast, score, tone...
57705|1|Rises above its modest production values and fairly simple idea by way of veteran character actor Raymond J. Barry's riveting performance.
24500|1|Stallone's performance as a Philadelphia saint in a B movie physique leaves you undecided whether to gag or sob, but the final fight sequences make up for it; a full-blooded Hollywood finale reaching giddy heights of cathartic glee.
18059|0|As far as the movie's message is considered -- if only grown-ups could be more like kids -- Jerry Lewis did an infinitely better job of plugging it in the 50s.
14275|1|John Williams's Oscar-winning music and the excellent performances of Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss add to the ingeniously mounted tension that cleverly plays on all our deepest primeval fears.
73541|1|"For all its scale, it is at its heart a ""nerd"" comedy"
30688|0|The vacuous but well-meaning pic is poorly executed and seems as if it were a TV movie.
48637|1|Loretta Lynn's tough but heartwarming biopic.
78378|1|It's a genuinely intriguing thriller and a mystery with a most rewarding conclusion.
44627|1|A confined domestic drama, a considerable morality tale, a fleeting futuristic noir, a persecution parable, an on-the-nose fairy tale adventure... and then it keeps going.
49642|1|A very flawed but entertaining and cheesy monster flick that would be fun to watch around a crowd with some popcorn.
70577|1|Vibrant funking-up of Hammer bloodsuckers
54854|0|This is a bad flick that will appeal mostly to kids ranging from ages 5-11, but adults will leave halfway through. I found it almost tolerable.
42109|0|The dialogue (polished by Tom Stoppard, no less) strains for a wit it never achieves.
82799|0|I have no doubt that Racing Stripes will be a solid hit with younger kids. But adults watching it with them may want to bring along a good book.
20610|1|...intended mainly for kids, most audiences, young and old, will get a kick out of it. ...the film is entertaining in its own low-key manner.
57752|1|Writer/director Jeong-hyang Lee, in only her second feature, establishes a situation rife with gentle humor and honest, unaffected love.
20152|1|Underrated sequel that gets better with age.
70736|0|Unbearably life affirming and quasi-spiritual... [Sharif] dispenses bromides like a watery-eyed, Middle-Eastern Forrest Gump.
12120|1|While it takes a little getting used to, Wenders' look at Heaven and Earth and the tug between living an experience instead of merely observing is pleasantly haunting.
67239|1|Girlhood thoughtfully questions not just the system itself, but our unfair assumptions about the young people caught within it.
68846|1|A literary riddle that every viewer is challenged to decipher in light of his or her own perception of human passion and prejudice.
56379|1|The spirit of the old school echoes strongly throughout the film and parallels the purity of the passions and personalities of the paramours.
101875|0|Director Marc Forster gets the action scenes right but never shapes the film as a whole. And if Craig, a talented actor, wants to be a Bond for the ages, he needs to lighten up. James Bond shouldn't be all work and no play.
82106|1|A highly entertaining look at these bizarre personalities and an insight into their obsession with Scrabble.
86223|1|It's exquisite, unbearable, and unforgettable.
73157|0|Internal Affairs is all stylish visuals and no substance whatsoever. That may be an attempt to hide the silliness of Henry Bean's first-time screenplay, but it doesn't work.
11345|1|The genius of John Carpenter includes his subtlety in composition. The man has always known that the best special effects are invisible and never detract from the story.
12383|1|endlessly compelling
16670|0|A Coen-esque screwball.
305|0|The four segments are widely different in quality. On the useful scale of the Michelin guides, one is worth a trip, another is worth a detour, and the other two are a colossal waste of bandwidth.
42083|0|For all its ambition and richness of style, Signs & Wonders never shows us what's inside Alec.
530|1|The movie is neither indulgent in its portrayal of emotionally-charged subject matter, nor does it shy away from the consequences of murder.
90579|0|Should convince studios that banking on computer-weaned kids to actually leave their keyboards to venture out of the house and pay for a movie was, is and will remain a bad idea.
41527|1|Delightfully funny and honest
102028|0|...ultimately about as enthralling as a low-rent Saturday morning cartoon.
4688|0|The title implies how long you'll be able to sit through it.
75995|0|So, as with many a hit French film, this was remade in English with an all-American cast. Also, as with most of these remakes, this one sucks big time...
15781|1|The movie plays like a mix of documentary and dream; it's part of a cinematic experience that is quite new to Western movie audiences.
28201|1|An almost excessively erratic legal drama...
21997|1|Fine, disturbing Hitchcock near classic w/Connery and Hedren in good form.
74401|1|Antonioni created, as the Cannes jury put it in 1960, a new language of cinema, one that perfectly expressed a modern alienation that's enduring as well as the film.
77207|0|Todd's payday apparently sends comedy backward in time, and we're in the 1970s, ethno-sitcom style.
79202|1|Lavish but far-fetched tearjerker
82151|1|Provocative movies like this open a world of knowledge and ideas, stimulating thinking and conversation.
30860|0|Pollack's adaptation of Horace McCoy's depression era novel has not dated well.
65437|1|Anime has never been my cup of oolong. Or it wasn't until Satoshi Kon's bold, time-traveling sophomore feature, Millennium Actress.
27696|1|The Muppets are still a pure delight to watch, and this is the best post-Henson movie they've produced.
25901|1|[Michael Crichton] makes a creditable debut as a film director.
55670|1|Magnificent, filled with shimmering, luminescent images that evoke both paradise and paradise lost.
3647|0|Having 'National Lampoon' on your film doesn't guarantee it's quality.
67929|1|Actually fairly entertaining, buoyed by Schwarzenegger's self-deprecating charm and easy chemistry with his capable costar, Pamela Reed, and the hammiest bunch of tykes ever assembled for a movie.
29920|1|The sound alone is astonishing. Morricone's haunting, wistful score adds measurably to the sweep and timelessness of the film.
51750|1|If you're interested in exploring anime for the first time, then Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust is a good place to start as any other.
40704|1|After the fizzle of the later Roger Moore Bonds, The Living Daylights brings in a new 007 in Timothy Dalton, who manages the Connery trick of seeming suave and tough at the same time.
30575|1|Great fun to watch -- and not just for kids.
67630|0|Shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls, stubbly chins, liver spots, red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere.
17730|1|...the film has been infused with a deliberate pace that proves instrumental in establishing (and perpetuating) the source material's very specific atmosphere.
96768|0|... starts out as a meditation on the nature of art and the machinations of the marketplace ... curdles into an inconclusive and trivializing whodunit.
51838|0|Presenta los hechos de una manera que recuerda a lo peor de la derecha republicana, asemejándose a la patética y triste época del senador McCarthy y su 'cacería de brujas'
12529|1|Freundlich's intelligent, very funny take on male-female relationships manages the not inconsiderable feat of being both jaded and appealingly fresh.
43373|0|If I wanted to watch a muddled, clunky, wannabe-clever comedy, I'd wait for the next Saturday Night Live atrocity to come out.
88932|0|The milieu he chooses -- essentially one long, queerly prosaic car ride to nowhere -- robs the film of much of its dramatic force.
78713|1|Zhang Yimou's follow-up to Hero oddly feels more like a warm up.
42928|1|Not terrible, it just doesn't work very well.
45039|1|The film is notable for its smooth, moving, tracking camera and its complete lack of intertitles, making it a true universal experience.
94490|1|You know that the third Spider-Man had to be bigger. The third movie in a franchise goes for broke. And Spider-Man 3 is bigger, if not better. It's overdone, overlong, and overplotted. It's all over the place. This does not mean Spider-Man 3
97354|1|Oddly being marketed as a comedy by its distributor, The Savages is best approached as a drama with an intermittently light touch that's generally more of a curse than a boon.
5719|0|While the message that a girl can defend herself against the boys threatening her is a good one, it's lost in a movie where the bullies look like Mussolini's bodyguards and where Julie waits for her boyfriend and Miyagi to come to her defense.
42006|0|If any of these characters were half as resonant as Wenders appears to think they are, the film might have seemed charming instead of merely stranded.
18101|0|An intriguing whodunit about murder and computer software, The Spanish Prisoner fails because for the most part, its actors aren't up to the task, and Mamet is unable to educate them properly.
60500|1|A closely observed, somewhat funny, ultimately very sad movie.
5463|1|A gritty, haunting voyeur's peek into the human condition.
16566|1|Shocking in its originality, it is funny, frightening, thought-provoking and one of the year's best films.
77292|0|Silly sex farce involving self-absorbed people.
7050|1|Though cheesy and illogical, this thriller has charming performances, and an exciting climax.
48591|0|It uses every canted angle and cartoonish zoom from Sam Raimi's Evil Dead handbook, but the comatose screenplay just makes the stylish gymnastics look desperate.
93725|1|There is an intelligent movie to be made about Spartan warrior culture, but 300 is not it. It is a fun ride, though, as long as you don't see it on a full stomach.
22230|1|One of Hitchcock's most underrated efforts
71012|0|The stereotypes and blatant propaganda wouldn't irritate so much if the action itself wasn't so relentlessly dreary -- a desert of imagination, parched of original ideas.
78028|0|No matter how good Laura Linney is, she can't overcome this movie that goes nowhere and has nothing really interesting to say.
2578|1|There's no denying the raw and energetic feel Smith created with a memorable script, great characters and a genuine sense of Gen X angst.
49056|0|There isn't one genuine person or moment within sight.
101022|1|The cognoscenti will recognize touches that have turned up in eight Fellini features that followed this one.
244|0|It takes a two-hour act of will to keep facing the screen during this moribund movie.
68225|0|A very odd, expensive, ambitious failure that tries hard to achieve the Spielberg touch but succeeds only in reminding you of how few filmmakers can successfully lay claim to his territory.
3916|1|You may have Gloria Gaynor's 'I Will Survive' rattling through your head for a few days, but that's a small price to pay for an audience with true royalty.
15667|0|It's something to make you cringe at our cinematic history or to revel in how far we've come.
58986|1|Offers a persuasive look at a defeated but defiant nation in flux.
100845|1|One of the best films of the year. You'll laugh, You'll Cry... You'll truly appreciate life!
90397|1|As sword-and-sandal films go, 'The 300 Spartans' is a good one, but don't expect hard-edged action and graphic violence of the '300' sort.
53484|0|At 135-minutes, this stream-of-facts lecture trembles into the trenches of monotony without the detraction of technology.
80699|1|Conduzido com segurança por Yimou (ainda em início de carreira), o filme atravessa décadas e conta com um visual rico para narrar uma forte e trágica história de amor.
23775|1|Strong acting and a string of classic rock and soul tunes make up for a superficial script.
95003|0|Ultimately undone by its air of overly mannered preciousness.
79424|0|Unfortunately, the film's more poetic visual tendencies are frequently undermined by the unnecessary narration written and performed by Cocteau himself, which informs us of emotions and psychological states that are mostly evident on-screen.
39926|1|sneaks up on you in the nicest ways
9516|1|Once it settles down, 80 Days becomes a pretty enjoyable comic-action romp that's ultimately twice as much fun as a lot of technically better movies I could name.
27003|1|Aside from some unfortunate slapstick, it's a truly spectacular superhero sequel.
18973|1|Not nearly as awful as everyone seems to think it is.
71001|1|Whether or not the events depicted really happened to Hopkins, it's still a damn fun story.
10306|1|The movie is likable and sympathetic but probably too muted to compel much damn-the -torpedoing to the multiplex.
69567|0|With the exception of Charlize Theron's masterful performance as Wuornos, the film is a misguided mess.
92799|0|No child deserves Happily N'Ever After.
33358|1|Not bad. Pretty intense ending.
50479|0|If it was funny, I missed it.
31393|1|This classic musical paired Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire for the first time.
84267|0|As Mr. Stallone wends his way through barnyards and country cabins, the material retains some comic potential. But as the inevitable romance springs up between the two stars, their lack of rapport becomes all too noticeable.
8992|1|[VIDEO ESSAY] ...a closer reading finds a cutting commentary on the South's hypocritical, opportunistic, and racist attitudes that continue to infect American culture.
27257|1|Make no mistake: Even those who've previously managed to resist the Julia Juggernaut are likely to cave in after seeing 'Notting Hill.'
3003|0|A negligible piece of juvenile fluff.
82719|1|My favorite of the duo's adventures into Universal Monster-Town.
94172|0|This shrine to Disney is really the world's most overstuffed Hanna-Barbera cartoon, right down to its Gargamel-patterned villain.
38747|0|Everything about the movie is fine and dandy and dull.
13985|1|Sling Blade derives its power from Thornton's affecting characterization of Karl Childers.
81423|1|With its themes of human arrogance, wastefulness, creativity, and the definitions and limits of life and the mind, Innocence is pretty heavy. It's also visually stunning.
66388|1|One of Tavernier's worse
21053|0|The hero and heroine are sugar sculpture, and the witch looks like a clumsy tracing from a Charles Addams cartoon.
75236|0|Lame, over ambitious attempt at a globetrotting swashbuckler.
44835|1|An engrossing film that attempts to unearth a dark period of African history and the short-lived tenure of Lumumba's power.
27634|1|It works as well as it does because the central cast - equal parts male and female, lest we forget - are all so uniformly endearing.
59214|1|Crafty and beguiling and unexpectedly smart about people.
98267|1|Filmmaker Gibney, whose involvement with anti-establishment exposés could conceivably mark him for his own eventual rendition by the forces of freedom, carefully guides us up the chain of command to the policy level.
65462|1|Cybill Shepard is miscast in Bogdanovich's otherwise handsome adaptation of Henry James' famous novel.
47078|1|This is a flick for which I had very fond memories from back in the day, but watching it again after all these years, I can't say that it was as great as I once remembered it.
53121|0|This film manages the extraordinary, almost mythological feat of surpassing all that came before it to stand proud as the worst of all ten Friday the 13th movies.
42651|1|It's such a vibrant goof, so full of love both for the movies and for its cast of ridiculous characters that you forgive it the odd soggy stretch.
81380|1|After more than a decade in artistic exile, China's Tian Zhuangzhuang has resurfaced with a veritable vengeance, delivering what may well be the crowning achievement of his storied, turbulent career.
89393|0|Magic is neither eerie nor effective. It is, however, very heavy of hand.
5996|0|Perhaps writer-director Geoffrey Wright meant to show this motley crew as doomed from the start, but this obvious dead-end attitude also makes the group's repulsive antics all the more predictable.

44185|1|Although Rio Bravo rather ambles along, it still has enough good points to make it a genial viewing experience.
5009|1|The plot gets so convoluted and farfetched that you still may be scratching your head after the denouement, but you probably won't be bored.
63518|0|"Elle's still super cute, but this ""'Blonde"" is way dumber than the first."
60620|0|Though well-acted, Troche's third film, an adaptation of short stories, is a minor addition of a fractured, ensemble narrative to the overly populated genre of suburban malaise and anomie in the wake of the success of Mendes' Oscar-winner American Beauty
38193|1|Tom Green wishes he was even a tenth as funny as this.
7730|0|None of the three European director's stories catches the macabre flavor of Poe.
101254|1|Lacking even a Changing Lanes level of insight into America's racial partition, this old-school, domestic-invasion thriller still has Samuel L Jackson's twisted enforcer to push the right buttons.
99180|1|A niche doc.... Don't smoke this particular joint unless you're already familiar with the buzz.
68126|1|A sweet, perceptive story about the cost of deception and the power of family rituals.
12458|1|Tarkovsky majestically creates through editing rather than special effects the unstable universe of the Zone, and amidst the grime and the destruction, summons up moments of pure magic.
38182|1|Vulgar and uproariously funny.
65754|1|This is what family films are supposed to be like.
62523|1|Surprisingly better minus the original director and star, this sequel to the 2001 sleeper hit should have no problem speeding its way to box office gold

2651|0|Weinberg turns off the DVD player.
77968|1|This film imagines its viewers to be smart, possessed of a decent attention span and game for a challenge. It doesn't happen all that often.

17318|0|A good idea hopelessly strangled by Kevin Costner's ernestness.

40990|1|Perfect feel-good Christmas-period family entertainment. Highly recommended.
84398|0|Those interested in annoying things like plot or plausibility are best off steering clear of this inane celebration of all things thug.
55132|0|Predictable comedy has profanity, iffy humor, and violence.
86734|0|Maybe Al Pacino is losing his satanic touch.
39308|1|In the end [it] tells us we shouldn't depend on each other... we should be glad that 'we have ourselves.' What a lonely and sad conclusion.
39227|1|Three cheers for Bring It On.
67089|1|It's brilliantly conceived; it's intolerable. It is the indispensable film of any year when it appears.
100147|1|It's cleverly done with lots of nods to other zombie films. You'll probably catch it on DVD
89946|1|Another 'nice' Sandler comedy that works, thanks to some smart and genuinely moving ideas at its core.
15742|0|Who is the Godard guy and how could he make something as humdrum yet full-of-itself as Contempt?
67182|1|A fitting capstone to the French director who melded icy hipster cool with a Parisian underground of cops, robbers, and the unbreakable, unknowable bond between the two.
77069|0|What is rather horrifying is how this would-be thriller manages the bizarre feat of being simultaneously dull and completely ridiculous.
37097|1|... has its spirited moments.
53957|0|Farcical, old-fashioned Hans Christian Andersen tale.
43926|1|This animated fantasy comedy from DreamWorks is an irreverent, occasionally scatological fairy tale with state-of-the-art computer-generated images that almost steal a march on Toy Story.
91353|0|Benigni's quest to find comedy in the Muslim world falls quite flat.
57709|0|As for the script, it wanders around in circles when it should be building a sense of paranoia and menace.
1970|0|After seeing all the mayhem and watching how retarded and alienated the teens acted, the film felt as healthy as a combined diet of junk food and crystal meth (speed).
18619|1|What the film lacks is suspense, surprise (the new ending is a dud) and passion.
17887|1|A savvy and thought-provoking look at the nature of contemporary American politics.
32152|0|Certainly Wolfe's canvas might lend itself to a broad approach, but broad like Dr. Strangelove, not broad like the Three Stooges.
21354|1|A surprisingly passionate reworking of the classic Grimm Brothers' tale.
84620|0|"...great when it was called ""The Wedding Planner."""
16652|0|Rarely has so much of so little consequence been so closely examined.
365|0|Copycat, despite two tough-babe leads to kill for, flies in more directions than scattered kitty litter.
84646|1|Wickedly funny black comedy satirizes Italy's antiquated institutions.
100785|1|Coixet has blunted the impact of the novel's ending just as she has softened Roth's misanthropic depiction of Kepesh and, as a result, she's taken flak for being over-polite. I didn't care.
61093|1|A estrutura narrativa (obviamente inspirada em Rashomon) é interessante, mas a necessidade de criar reviravoltas surpreendentes praticamente destrói o filme, já que, ao final da projeção, nada mais faz sentido.
47070|1|What really makes this worth seeing is Cage's outrageously unbridled performance.
65619|0|full review in Greek
34299|1|Priceless comedy with a message-rich heart, mild swearing.
94386|0|I know, you couldn't make it up. But someone did.
10095|0|With a strange mix of varying English and American accents and the weight of a film with too many subplots, Robin Hood strains credibility. It also feels long.
76479|0|Were it not for the suicidal feelings you may find yourself with at the end of the 105 minutes, gosh, this might actually be a fun time.
19207|1|...captures the sort of confusion, condescension and even revulsion faced by returning veterans, then and today.
52658|1|A disorganized, confusing but amusing biopic.
67005|0|A lame duck of a movie.
49365|0|While the plot does work in mechanical terms, its multiple ins and outs never achieve more than plodding motion.
4271|0|Though the story has a certain universal appeal -- who hasn't felt like a useless jerk and wished to wake up capable of anything? -- the execution is oddly sour and distasteful.
49546|1|If the movie drags a bit in the dramatics department, that's probably because the filmmakers were shooting for 'accuracy' over 'emotion'.
47194|0|Though written and directed by a Pulitzer Prize winner, Original Sin is better known as the picture in which a naked Angelina Jolie (by then a certified Oscar winner) and Antonio Banderas do the horizontal mambo. [Blu-ray]
4955|0|You're virtually guaranteed to have forgotten it by the following morning.
30181|1|Anderson's screenplay is full of superb dialogue and has some unexpected twists.
11631|1|Disturbed, deranged and utterly brilliant.
29731|1|Total Recall is slick, sly and subversive, and if some of the special effects have aged somewhat, that only adds to the charm.
11029|1|"""Streep's magnetic, shattering performance haunts the memory"""
88868|1|16 Blocks is a good watch thanks to the performances of Bruce Willis and Mos Def.
41788|0|There's enough psychodrama here to have made an engaging film about grief, guilt, and fantasy but director Peter Del Monte drops the ball and gives us a mishmash.
66511|1|Julie-Marie Parmentier and Sylvie Testud are eerily convincing as the intense pair of co-dependents in the rigorous but creepy drama Murderous Maids.
100272|1|This is an important film that packs a powerful emotional punch almost 60 years after the main events.
74967|0|Somewhat of a self-fulfilling title.
69317|1|Poignant, heartbreaking proof that, sometimes, love is just not enough.
23328|0|Such a glorified workshop may have its rewards for the actors, but it leaves audiences with a booby prize.
57736|1|Standing in the Shadows of Motown is the best kind of documentary, one that makes a depleted yesterday feel very much like a brand-new tomorrow.
27409|1|The first half of Tarzan is Disney's best stuff since Beauty and the Beast ... [then it] declines into a typical showdown with a forgettable villain.
23777|1|Funny and ferociously smart.
81042|1|In addition to being an uplifting morality tale suitable for all ages, this refreshingly different work by filmmaker Michel Ocelot is an aural as well as a visual delight.
2470|1|Though my foreign Oscar pick would still have been Eat Drink Man Woman, Sun is such a personal close second that I can go with the academy novelty of novelties.
17992|0|When it comes to condemning the ancient Western code of violence, this film should practice what it preaches.
34096|0|...what are Mike Nichols and Annette Bening doing here?
65880|0|DeVito keeps hurling handfuls of well-funded excrement on the screen and expects us to think it's funny.
37807|1|A film OF the 1970s, The Conversation is rooted in the new American anxiety of the time, the idea that behind every ideal was a rotten, festering truth.
59949|0|Comedy/horror movies like Slither and the Evil Dead movies have already done this sort of thing a lot better.
67772|1|...constructed largely of close-ups and was filmed on a single concrete set representing the prison where Joan of Arc was imprisoned ...
44819|1|The remarkably thin plot works primarily due to Auteuil's disarming charm.
4172|1|Best romance ever. Real, genuine characters with real, developed relationships. Not insulting, not cutesy, just wonderful.
38227|1|A perfect pick if you've got a flick-addicted 14-year-old boy at home, and a fun genre flick for the whole family, Dreamscape is a little bit scary, a little bit smart, and a whole lotta B-movie fun.
43457|0|As a horror film, it's not scary nor suspenseful; and as an action picture, it's not terribly exciting, if at all.
23499|1|The smooth, soothing soundtrack could not be a better fit for the laid-back, low-key, unforced appeal of the film.
34288|0|Apesar de importante na gênese do gore, Lewis era um péssimo cineasta, roteirista, compositor e diretor de fotografia. Mas, como Ed Wood, seus filmes têm o charme da ruindade.
100806|1|Stiller one-ups his Zoolander fashion-world creation with Tugg Speedman, an action hero trying to revive his flagging, Sly Stallone-type career by appearing in the most expensive war movie ever made.
10230|1|I didn't particularly want to like Freeway, but I couldn't help myself. Reese Witherspoon made me.
64036|1|There is a lot of Billy Wilder in [Avanti!], including the idea that age is a state of mind. The film doesn't all work, [but] when the rigid Armbruster warms up on a sunny rock,... Wilder is telling us something that is more than just fun.
5951|0|Aaargh!!!
75133|0|A really bad movie that exists solely to showcase McCartney's new tunes.
11976|0|Count me out of the fan club for this one.
29547|1|Unique western w/Union and Confederate adversaries Holden and Widmark stealing show.
71632|1|Powerful and provocative--if perhaps a bit subdued.
65638|1|Has a mad energy and proud idiocy that's impossible to deny.
64538|1|Similar to the recent Dog Days and Divine Intervention, Carnage fares much better than both.
26956|0|A peculiar hybrid: a high-camp Hollywood bio flick about child abuse, elevated substantially above its sordid material by Faye Dunaway's obsessively committed interpretation of legndary star Joan Crawford.
45993|1|This 20-year-old film reminds us of a time before independent movies became the formulaic fare they often are these days.
73136|0|(Rambo) really only has 3-4 minutes of redeeming entertainment.
80258|1|"One of the finest documentaries ever made, Barbara Kopple's ""Harlan County U.S.A."" is a brilliant exposé about the embattled history of coal miners in America as seen through the very personal prism of striking coal miners in Harlan County, Kentucky in 19"
34359|1|A smart, witty character piece that eschews the stale sports flick formul
48891|0|"The movie's poster advertises ""a castle can only have one king"". That may be true, but how come this ""Last Castle"" has so many jesters?"
60703|0|despite low expectations, you press on, hoping for something interesting to happen
69509|1|Uneven, profane and occasionally flat-out hilarious.
3736|0|re-do it as a 10-15 minute motivational tape as a seminar for business and sales people
32784|1|An engrossing, if occasionally ludicrous, hit tearjerker with Pollack, Streisand, and Redford doing a good job of bringing Arthur Laurents' script to the screen.
84462|0|This slapdash comedy barely coughs up more than a couple of funny scenes as the story moves in predictable fits and starts before sputtering out of fuel half way through.
66184|0|Insipid and idiotic.
13339|1|Although it is a spectacle film, the story of how a man takes on the tyranny of the Romans, with all sorts of horrible consequences to himself and his family, is powerful and gripping.
17813|0|Verges on unconscious parody.
100405|1|It may look half-finished, but it's bright and silly and passes the time.
8186|0|Mostly harmless.
100945|1|A whacked-out, superannuated, would-be rock star might seem to be too easy a comic target, but Wilson gives this sad sack so many fresh twists that he never wears out his welcome.
1320|1|It's light on plot and character, but the stunts are well staged.
10841|1|An exercise made by an enormously talented constructor of thrillers in the most fertile period of his career.
75751|1|Proof of the absence of God comes when Marx Brothers gags get the scissors ... yet we still must endure a show-stopping (in the worst sense of the word) water-ballet number that's a dose of Robitussin when the movie needs a double espresso.
805|0|Strangely sour and ultimately wearisome.
15624|0|Stifled by quaint Masterpiece Theatre-for-tykes pretensions, Buddy only comes alive when its quartet of real-life chimps go ape.

53032|0|A dreary, incoherent, self-indulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours...a cacophony of pretentious, meaningless prattle.
83959|1|The most endearing aspect of D.E.B.S., a sweet-spirited spoof, is that the lesbian romance is played for real, with no nudge-nudge wink-wink irony.
22259|1|Top-notch espionage thriller with a jaw-dropping finale atop the Statue of Liberty.
49391|0|This is the kind of role Lawrence can phone in, and that is exactly what he has done.
15743|1|Godard's self-reflexive meditation about love, marriage, and filmmaking is a masterpiece, which among other things, proves that sex symbol Brigitte Bardot could act.
25905|1|Maybe its ambitions outpace its performance, but at least it tries.
48643|1|A rousing musical biopic that is a cut above its peers.
59085|1|A bela performance de Hoffman é prejudicada pelo roteiro irregular, que o obriga a passar por mudanças súbitas e inexplicáveis, como se a necessidade de arrancar lágrimas do espectador fosse maior do que o interesse em buscar coesão para a história.
32280|0|Inappropriate for audiences of all ages.
49339|0|A sloppy, harebrained movie, which looks like it was made on a fraction of the budget of one of their videos.
31466|1|O.K. courtroom drama, electrified by great Newman performance
40327|1|Like the Turkey Day feast, the delicious payoff is worth the wait.
33055|1|A great film which can be explored on multiple levels.
6639|1|The Wild Bunch is an American masterpiece, one of the greatest films ever produced in the Hollywood system.
49930|1|"One of the first films to usher in sound in cinema, ""The Blue Angel"" remains an outstanding cinematic achievement that has influenced untold numbers of artists in all avenues of performance and exhibition."
26056|0|Every bit of the original's nastiness is retained but none of its wit or elegance.
99160|1|Though the film is primarily designed to appeal to viewers in the early-teen demographic, a maturity and intelligence is at work here that will connect with many adults also.
6575|1|Even if it is a compromised version of the TV show, it's far, far better than nothing.
53255|1|The Aviator is more than entertaining and engrossing enough to keep you interested ... for at least 130 minutes or so.
52763|1|Dog-eat-dog urban drama has great script, direction -- and unexpectedly smart performances from Affleck and Jackson.
59286|0|Trashy remake of John M. Stahl's 1934 classic
63488|1|...you take the good with the bad, the funny moments with the long intervals of less inspired bits.
91334|0|Roberto Benigni here plays out a madcap tale of romantic obsession against the backdrop of the Iraq invasion. The results are neither profound nor funny.
71703|1|Bertuccelli neatly unpacks these three women's burdened lives and leaves us with a haunting souvenir-the last scene is a shimmering revelation.
20733|1|Each change of angle and shift of light evokes an inner disturbance; the actors seem to push through the dense shadow as through water, revealing fast people in slow motion ...
102467|0|A clumsily melodramatic movie that tells us too much too soon and forces us to sit through endless morose vacuousness.
30660|1|Sean Connery's fourth Bond film, Thunderball, slips from the peak of From Russia with Love and Goldfinger, but still provides plenty of thrills of the brand only 007 can provide. [Blu-ray]

85279|1|Morgan Freeman's slick voice-over compounds a slightly plodding structure, but the dedication of the penguins -- and the cameramen -- assure your wonderment.

64360|1|depicts crime and violence as a moral vacuum that draws in the narcissistic and the pathetic without ever moralizing or preaching
48150|1|Burns has a way with actors and a way with dialogue, but he hasn't matured to the point where he can offer up a slice of life that doesn't feel pre-programmed.
47689|1|One of the most terrifying horror movies to come along in years...
74511|1|The climb has both comic and dramatic weight because it is both a thrilling exercise in physical humor and a thematically rich evocation of the pressures men feel to succeed, lest they be viewed as less than a man
71244|0|The Girl Next Door might have been another slice of American Pie if it wasn't quite so unsavoury.
2290|0|A few stray moments of wit mired amidst a low-key and sleep-inducing presentation.

39249|1|With this new, dynamic duo in place, the possibilities for exploring the fabled final frontier seem endless.
33465|1|Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson give lively performances as the heroes, who relate better to basketballs than to women or the business world. The movie doesn't add up to very much, though.
39273|0|...the movie comes off as one long attempt to shock.
16766|1|Like David Mamet and relative newcomer Quentin Tarantino, Downey writes some of the best dialogue around, and his script sparkles with it.
32011|0|Demi Moore will do as the ghost of Hollywood past, rattling her jewelled accessories like a drag-queen Jacob Marley.
96588|0|Ever notice that sports movies that mean to inspire us with the message that winning isn't everything almost always end up with a victory?
57397|1|Some have condemned this film for 'filthy content.' That's like condemning a hospital for being a place of disease. Kidd deals with 'filth' the way a surgeon treats a tumor.
28454|1|Scripted by Raphaelson, the helmer's frequent collaborator, this light, suave comedy of manners (his first in color) displays what's known as the Lubitsch touch and would have been more successful with a more charismatic actor than Don Ameche.

96836|1|After an ebullient and inventive first half, the film loses its wind and only gets it back for a sprint or two.

178|1|Registers as a polished and delightful romantic comedy about soulmates.
33723|1|Possibly Cassavetes' best -- this one actually has a plot!
77084|0|Moves slowly, looks terrible and copies the first film shamelessly. Rather than a sequel, it's a retread, with David S. Ward's screenplay supplying hoodlum lingo you could cut with a knife and outlining a set of similar shenanigans.
64489|0|A hard chestnut to swallow.
68333|0|Harmless and totally familiar, it's better than static and informercials, but that's about the sum of it.
12756|1|A carnival of the soul.
11787|1|Even if all My Left Foot had to offer was Day-Lewis's performance, it'd be a must-see movie.
72689|0|Good intentions go for naught as director Robert Mandel (F/X) pounds home every contrivance in the script by Darryl Ponicsan (Taps).
84216|0|Dust to Glory is a valentine from a committed fan, full of gee-whiz idolizing that -- for this viewer, anyway -- quickly wears thin.

5805|0|Being under the PC microscope transforms Demme into the bastard offspring of Stanley Kramer and Norman Lear
33807|1|In many ways, Not One Less resembles the socialist-realist dramas of the early Communist regimes. But Zhang has something smarter and more amusing up his sleeve.
43946|0|An overly familiar, poorly cast and often annoyingly crude New York comedy that never finds its groove.
38119|1|It's a spectacular, well-made epic that I just could not enjoy -- at least not after the first hour.
78053|1|This is Kinski's show and she flat out steals it.
35416|0|Without a strongly sympathetic figure at the center of the movie, Jacob's plight seems very remote. Watching this film should feel like being caught in a nightmare, but it feels more like watching someone else who is caught in a nightmare.
13904|0|This preposterously plotted, ineptly helmed film features the emabrrassing directing debut of actor Kevin Spacey, wasting the talents of Matt Dillon, Gary Sinise, Viggo Mortensen, Joe Mantegna, Faye Dunaway, and others.
52837|0|The potential of this pure Hollywood Babylon story remains unrealised, instead playing out as half-baked Agatha Christie.
34863|1|It's perhaps one of the greatest summer movies of all time. Do the Right Thing is as perfect as a film can get.

61464|1|Has an optimistic outlook that uses pessimistic results in a manner fitting for a film of such solid morality.
43317|0|The film is really much ado about very little because it takes no stand and gives little insight into the Chopper's psyche , all while too carefully catering to his machinated media image.
84964|1|By today's standards, Mervyn LeRoy's film is a kitschy spectacle, but in 1951, it was immensely popular and MGM spent its biggest budget to date for a star-driven production that shot for a whole year at Rome's Cinnecitta Studios.
101508|1|This is a wonderful film.
19345|1|Quincy Jones provides a score that perfectly complements the flavorful atmosphere.
41692|0|Extremely gory horror movie; not for kids.

97684|1|[REC] is ridiculously good. It's a show-stopping terror trip through something that really shouldn't work all that well.
18734|0|Goes about halfway toward setting new boundaries for Disney's, and the industry's, animated features, but doesn't go far enough.
80198|0|The mise-en-scene is packed with colorful, often shocking images (blood and body wastes are recurring motifs) but orchestrated in a creative delirium.
101898|0|There are some very serious issues here about absent fathers and the lack of positive role models for young males, but they're just a cynical hook for a film full of homophobic, misogynist humour.
47552|1|(Bubble Boy) squanders its strongest moments but at least has the courage to attempt strong moments.
73887|1|Weighed down by heavy-handed sentiment and largely free of [Kitano's] trademark dark humor, Dolls is still a compelling work from a genuine talent.
66002|1|Fairly harsh, sobering stuff.
62068|0|what was fascinating character study becomes banal and unconvincing cautionary tale
32829|1|Based on the memoirs of Henri Charriere, the only man to have successfully escaped from Devil's Island, this is a grim and brutal prison drama, made more likable due to the lead star performances.
19914|0|It seems the latest stage in some curious evolutionary pattern; the slasher species keeps proliferating and getting weaker at the same time.
98732|1|Finds the filmmaker admirably working without a safety net

20181|0|Polish Wedding fails to engage us!
89474|1|In its neatest trick of all, the script circumvents any criticism of its lack of timeliness by very literally casting the proceedings under a shadow of death.
101736|0|This is an uneven, uninspired, tired spoof that has about 10 funny jokes throughout.
13868|1|Richard Donner directs more for speed than mood, but there are a few good shocks.

48134|0|The script is more hard-hitting and realistic than [Besson's] Transporter films, which means youll only laugh out loud two or three times.
75297|1|Brilliant, unique and poignant autobiographical drama.
17037|1|A gorgeous piece of work.
92323|1|A movie that seems gritty and pointless for its first third, begins to grow in meaning as the pointlessness snowballs into absurdity and then tragedy.
45876|0|I am not going to try to tell you that this one-joke, talking-horse comedy is, in any meaningful sense, a good movie. What I am going to say is that it's a little better than my rock-bottom expectations led me to predict.
27012|1|Enjoyable, nevertheless.
77130|0|It's predictable. It's cliché. But it's fun to watch.
34761|1|The best thing that Ridley Scott ever directed that didn't take place in an impressively designed industrial future.
86999|0|The film doesn't take the direction most sequels do and manages to adequately follow up the original.
54712|0|Why sit through a crummy, wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies, when you could just rent those movies instead, let alone seek out a respectable new one?
52337|1|Surprising and rather suspenseful crime drama and the perfect follow-up from the director who composes a pleasing violent moral duality tale...
22520|1|Without Limits makes for an engrossing examination of the will to win, the importance of icons in American sports, and the interference of money in amateur athletics.
27199|1|See it, but lower your expectations.
15908|1|A solidly entertaining drama that stays true to the independent spirit of its filmmakers
23140|1|Laugh til' you drop - the musical version of The Producers is finally here. When Mel Brooks conceived his comedy satire, the subject matter of ridiculing Hitler was brave to say the least. And nearly 40 years later, it still leaves bite marks.
98312|0|Children might find the slapstick routines amusing, but for older viewers this is a mirthless voyage.
73054|1|An astonishing, deeply engrossing Italian family saga that happens to be six hours long.
102286|1|What helps the film rise above the level of a photographed college lecture is the director's inventive and playful presentation.
8406|1|Oddball charmer about the quirky way certain people are put together just when they need each other most.
54607|0|...takes its place among a small group of undersea motion pictures. Unfortunately, it takes its place at the end of the line.
60037|0|Deliver us from screenplays that force likable protagonists to twist and bend their personalities to serve the contortions of a ridiculous and formulaic plot.
13842|1|One of the most intelligent and terrifying horror films of the 1980s.
44769|1|Klapisch has a light, springy touch and a real adoration for his characters and their Paris/London locations, and even at a lengthy 126 minutes, the film never drags.
100370|1|The story itself takes a few bloodcurdling turns off the tracks, with well-played action sequences.
59319|1|the film that made consummate French actor Jean Gabin a star
50783|0|This isn't the worst superhero parody ever created, it's just one of them.
43589|1|An absorbing, visually poetic portrait of one woman's subconscious refusal to come to grips with loss and grief.
55316|1|Dreyfuss and Estevez have true comedic chemistry.
90063|1|I've not been overly impressed with Shyamalan's last few films, but this one is better.
38637|0|Please, for the love of God, don't let it be a franchise. Think of the parents.
77782|0|The whale should have sunk every reel of this silliness in the deepest part of the ocean.
48305|1|The gags are bright and Blake Edwards's direction adroit enough to make Operation Petticoat an enjoyable time.
2|1|Apesar de representar um imenso avanço tecnológico, a força do filme reside no carisma de seus personagens e no charme de sua história.
57112|1|Brooks can be very funny, but sometimes his whining mutes the laughs.
14311|1|Garner and Lemmon's chemistry save the film.
53408|1|Watch this one if you've ever wondered how Goldie Hawn became a star.
99390|0|Even a hilarious turn by Kristen Wiig as the owner of a doughnut company can't save this clichéd, meandering story from playing like American Beauty lite.
33491|1|A slight, good-humored film that's a lot more painless than might have been expected.
74445|1|A marvelously wise and moving classic, but also one full of sights that might make you cry, like Genjuro, 'I never imagined such pleasures existed!'
7609|1|A poetic, terse, beautifully exact, and highly personal re-creation of the American underworld, with an unpunctuated Joycean screenplay by Polonsky that is perhaps unique in the American cinema.
98981|0|Its mushy humanism is...insidious.
65630|0|It's deliberate exploitation, but not clever enough to be much fun.
49240|1|Fascinating and engrossing character study with strong performances from the cast...
60580|0|The movie regales us with the heroics of a (mostly) white American platoon picking off anonymous black savages.
56956|1|A not to be missed film for political junkies.
46299|1|Michael J. Fox is a revelation as the mouse that roared, whilst the score, the direction, and the rest of the cast turn a risky film into a solid addition to the Nam canon.
49905|0|Flashily but irritatingly shot, full of unmotivated switches from colour to b/w, sudden flashbacks, mannered slow mo and jump cuts, this is hardly a subtle evocation of its subject's life.
80366|1|Intriguing but enigmatic backstage theater melodrama with shades of All About Eve.
73601|1|This is the world discovered and illuminated by gonzo documentarian Marc Singer, who spent a good part of two years living with and chronicling the lives of a half-dozen tunnel dwellers for his remarkable first film, Dark Days
92880|0|Something of a muddle....The level of social criticism and psychological portraiture shifts from Howard's End to Mary Poppins.
32857|1|The Last Detail is one superbly funny, uproariously intelligent performance, plus two others that are very, very good, which are so effectively surrounded by profound bleakness that it seems to be a new kind of anti-comedy.
8323|1|This powerful film offers Westerners a potent dosage of what life is like in a Third World country, a country most Americans only envision in a depersonalized way.
54669|0|..it pulls all the heart strings it can in a shameless attempt to get real emotions.
27147|1|A string of hummable songs gives it momentum, Gray's admirably straight-faced narrator holds it together, and a run on black lingerie takes care of almost everything else.
39787|1|Terrific entry in the James Whale horror canon
51854|0|Trouble Every Day is a success in some sense, but it's hard to like a film so cold and dead.
68348|1|Beinex's Oscar-nominated, quintessentially French amour fou tells of a love relationship that descends into madness, splendidly played by Dalle as the free-spirited troubled femme; one scene of self-inflicted violence is truly tough to watch.
7257|1|Eastwood handles it professionally, intelligently, and beautifully.
94164|1|Pleasant but insubstantial, and with characters whose eccentricities feel just a tad forced and artificial, this is a mild diversion of a film.
95143|1|A Mighty Heart may be the most undeservedly overlooked movie of the year.
41111|0|Damon is 30 and Cruz will soon be 27, and they look it. And there goes the drama.
43169|1|"""The Day I Became a Woman"" is a trio of fables which simply yet evocatively lay out the problems of being a woman in Iran."
54415|1|Both illuminating and dispiriting.
84342|1|The sort of movie you root for, hoping it'll break through to be something special. It never quite does, but it still has the not-insignificant value of two fine actresses cast as sisters. [Blu-ray]
83806|0|Caspian is a visual sleeper hold from frame one; a constipated effort to erect widescreen wonderment, yet the production is missing dimension and needed narrative gusto.
7629|0|A hokey summer entertainment that is full of big machinery, satellite dishes du jour, long embarrassing close-ups and gaps in logic through which large UFOs could hurtle.
2515|0|The film should have featured more absurd and nonsensical elements.
8749|1|Why is this movie Hitchcock's masterpiece? Because no movie plunges us more deeply into the dizzying heart of erotic obsession.
49477|1|"""Bedroom"" is unflinchingly direct and true to life, even when it addresses grief, another topic traditionally off-limits in the movies."
93993|0|There is some great acting here, and some scenes do have an undercurrent of elemental power in them that tugs at your ankles. But the film never pulls you in.
43652|1|Robin Williams displays the acting chops that would later win him an Oscar
56207|0|I would have enjoyed Elysian more if the filmmakers had tried to ease off the dramatic fireworks and just let the characters and their dilemmas naturally progress.
54681|1|Zhang Yimou's latest film is deceptively emotive, its power hidden behind a smoke screen of comedy. We start by laughing but by the end we have tears on our cheeks.
30347|0|This melodrama about a child with an inbred talent for homicide is pretty unpleasant stuff on its own.
76773|1|No one does Holmes like Basil, and this ranks among the stronger of the series
26363|1|With terrific performances from Bale and Watson, the film is memorable and unique instead of plain and watchable.
5064|1|Despite some gags which use the benefit of hindsight too much for their own good, this is a smart piece of filmmaking which suggests Linklater is already one of the more formidable talents of the 90s.
13778|1|Very clever, well-made and unpredictable.
13196|1|One of Mel Brooks' best films.
54195|1|Perhaps the major reason for its emotional wallop is how Noyce gets a remarkable performance out of his three little road warriors, untrained actors all, whose eyes alone carry enough sadness and determination to break a million hearts.
67952|1|Brando gives a terrific performance, but Bertolucci's movie as a whole, which was so bold and audacious in 1972, does not hold up very well.
47535|0|Innocence is beautifully photographed by Benoit Debie, directed with assurance and sure to make you wonder what you've just seen.
70101|1|Has a slick of bestial sweat to it that promises that the explosion of really naughty stuff is looming.
53473|1|Not much to complain about here. Except that Hollywood doesn't come up more often with surprises this pleasant.
11929|1|Mandy Patinkin, as Inigo Montoya, deserves special mention. Inigo is the one character in the film who contains real emotional depth, and Patinkin plumbs it.
53320|1|As helmed by Fosse and interpreted by Dustin Hoffman, Lenny is too fragmented and episodic to illuminate the controversial comedian but it's a personal, prophetic film, offering insights into the real life and death of Bob Fosse as a filmmaker.
68678|1|The picture is filled with one sight gag after another, many familiar to anyone old enough to remember the glory days of silent comedy.
3895|0|An absolute torture test.
92238|0|Because the movie can't bring itself to take that leap into full-on absurdity, the characters and comic opportunities stay confined to their cells.
82948|0|There's just enough slicks and smarts in this movie to make you wish the rest of it weren't so darn stupid.
10524|0|For a picture that's almost a complete misfire, it's painless to sit through.
83151|0|The grim view of the future is nothing new, the special effects involve poorly used matte paintings and pyrotechnics, and the actors do far too many double-takes.
5096|0|Despite a promising start, Cowgirls is one of the most boring movies of all time, a ridiculous stew of mysticism, flat satire, and whimsy.
31781|1|A specialist in bringing books to life as movies, Redford has a knack for finding what matters in the text and making sure it ends up on screen.
71861|1|Lee ... has created a brilliant war movie that encompasses many elements, but manages to engage us with all of the stories within the story he wants to tell.
12981|1|Bill Murray is the one veteran of the Saturday Night Live/SCTV axis who still knows how to enter into a giddy conspiracy with his audience.
91410|1|I left the theatre wishing I could return to the days when I was a lot more like Yankee Irving than I'd care to admit.
91869|1|Whitaker's riveting and deserved Oscar-nominated performance pretty much dominates -- almost to the point of overpowering -- this fictionalized drama, based on Giles Foden's novel.
37175|1|The corrosive, nihilistic ugliness of excessive wealth and consumer culture has never been quite so damningly exposed.
50019|1|Despite good acting from the two pairs, viewers expecting illuminating insights about the literary genius, eccentric philosophy and complex sexuality of Iris Murdoch will be disappointed by Richard Eyre's minor, rambling, TV-like film.
85055|0|A wacky Hollywood satire that never catches fire.
41094|1|Mamet loves the interplay of words, rife with sharp exchanges and ready witticisms
64115|1|This unjustly forgotten Billy Wilder film takes on the much-loved character of Sherlock Holmes and attempts to humanize him by examining his vulnerabilities.
58506|1|Pretty formulaic stuff...but the specific setting...sets it apart.
71377|0|The tone is uneven, with the dark moments lacking a tanglible sense of danger and the uplifting scenes missing a much-needed lightheartedness.
83196|1|If it isn't the best trip you've ever taken to the dark Montmartre of the 1950s, it's nevertheless a real French noir. Irresistible, in other words.
78261|1|The Grudge is a decent horror diversion: barely a classic, but still pretty atmospheric and suspenseful in its own right.
31223|1|Surprisingly charming comedy.
40305|0|Nobody who hasn't spent time in an asylum could have believed that this film was ever going to amount to anything.
40030|0|É impressionante que 13 Fantasmas tenha sido montado por três editores, já que a trama (na falta de um termo melhor) flui de maneira absolutamente caótica.
5622|1|One of the most extraordinary moments in screen history. Oshima's film widens and deepens the sensual realm.
14399|1|Marvelous characters in messy script.
91131|1|Should be required viewing for the creator of 'Mallard Fillmore' and others who believe bilingualism is somehow a threat to U.S. security.
56765|0|A return to the near unwatchableness of certain earlier installments...
86021|0|I wouldn't even encourage movie-goers who adore this type of film to give it a try because you'd be much better off renting anything from the action section of your favorite video store.
12856|0|...a glaring example of the element of the Marx Brothers' comedy that's always bothered me: the reliance on insults and cruelty.
36127|1|Diner features a group of twentysomething friends whose camaraderie, hijinks and troubles ought to resonate with many viewers.
91574|1|It's so audacious and so technically accomplished, and arrives here garlanded with so many radiant superlatives, that I wish I liked it more.
4282|1|[Gibson and Garner] can make you smile contentedly even when the script is wandering and they're just sort of standing around waiting for its next good part to develop.
60002|1|A visually intense examination of Turkish mores and customs.
22694|0|This is a movie that's just sort of there, and nobody much would have paid any attention to it without the Madonna connection. And chances are nobody much will even with that connection.
70027|0|Best feature was the photography by Laszlo Kovacs.
41456|1|A touching meditation upon the spiritual concept of soul mates.
93930|1|Howard anchors the film with a charismatic turn. He doesn't turn Ellis into a plaster saint but portrays a complex and complicated man.
6161|1|The epidosic (by necessity) movie is uneven, but some of the stories are poignant and the acting always compelling
25781|0|Corn II is so despicable that it makes the lowly Children of the Corn flick from '84 look good.
39928|1|Thoughtful, enjoyable film for older teens.
14509|1|Mann wasn't thinking story, he was thinking scheme. Keep the eyes and ears dazzled, he reasons, and the substance will follow.
98610|1|The movie is determinedly low-key, but honest, with a wrenching break-up scene, sharp work from Clarkson, and a final thought that lingers, about never really knowing what your other half is thinking.
70063|1|Jacques Tati's bumbling stick-bug of an alter ego is considered by many to be the funniest creation to come out of Gallic cinema.
51726|0|Why, Lord, why?
74514|1|Harold Lloyd manages to make the characters sympathetic enough to carry the audience's concern on his journey of crazy stunts and mishaps. One of the best of this era.
63585|1|Charlotte Rampling's superb performance and the film's artistic, enigmatic ending will haunt me for a long time to come.
77948|0|The film is a modest vehicle for large talents and should have earned its funding as a matter of product placement.
47619|1|Its rampant oddness is certain to polarize audiences.
49572|0|... threadbare, run-of-the-mill war drama.
53545|1|Boisterous fun, with Day's performance - as the song goes - as busy as a fizzy sarsaparilla.
48331|1|Still quite effective stalker-thriller, has dated somewhat
85176|1|The doc doesn't go as deep as it could, but as a snapshot of a facet of hip-hop and pop culture, it's perfect, and devoid of the garish style of LaChapelle's photographs.
97980|0|A 34-year-old music-video director, Labaki shows promise with a smooth, artistic eye, although she succumbs to the Mel Gibson-like tendency to give herself the most closeups.
94803|0|As labors of love go, this one is harmless enough. It's just not particularly elegant or well-crafted, or even inspiring, to be worth seeking out.
63242|0|The tepid lead characters, housed by actors who don't even share any chemistry, finally have nowhere to go in a film as flat as its interior dime-store novel.
26606|1|This remarkable film may be set in high school, but its satiric take on moral corruption, political chicanery, adultery and seduction is anything but juvenile.
32300|0|One can assume another reboot will be in the offing after this monstrosity tanks at the box office.
31872|1|Pitch-perfect performances rescue a potentially melodramatic affair.
9680|0|Read the book
37996|0|Silly star crossed sex obsessed love flick.
13096|1|As written by Coppola and directed by Shaffner, Patton bears an ambiguous message, attempting to please right-wing and left-wing viewers, though George C. Scott's powerful performance rises above the film's politics.
29651|1|A suspenseful piece of work. Expect to be depressed.
79896|1|Penn's genius overtakes the dropout romance, like a final post-bacchanal hangover that suggests liberation as an El Dorado dream.
83459|0|The movie stops being about [its characters] - and starts being about the ways writer-director Matthew Parkhill can screw with your head.
20336|1|Fawn-dly revered Disney classic.
68462|1|Weary book, still wonderful score.
69891|0|I guess I should just be happy it didn't end up worse and hope these guys don't come hurt me for saying all this.
34413|1|Lucas' sleeper hit...casts a rose-colored eye back to a placid pre-Vietnam America, a time when rock 'n' roll was young and hot rods were cool.
35740|1|Still Eastwood's best directorial effort for my money.
97974|1|The result is a sweet, but certainly not cloying, film about relationships in modern Beirut %u2013 the city to which Labaki dedicates her film.
87250|1|Except for a few missteps, the movie is so beautifully and sensitively rendered in its particulars, in its characterizations of soldiers and officers, and in its dramatization of a nearly miraculous event, that the result is an affecting piece of cinema.
25353|1|Boasts two bravura performances--from Newman, who finally -- and deservedly -- won an Oscar for Best Actor, and Cruise, who is a joy to behold. Watch for Forest Whittaker and Iggy Pop in colorful bit roles.
64763|0|There ought to be a directing license, so that Ed Burns can have his revoked.
44543|0|It's stiff and soggy at the same time, and Dafoe's priest-as-Superman performance is unintentionally funny.
62413|1|It looks great, of course: All the Pixar movies do. But the genius of those other movies lay in their actual stories -- stories as inspired as the animation.
96334|0|It says something when even a classic Morgan Freeman performance can't bring Feast of Love a smidge closer to realism. In other words, he can't be blamed for headlining an untenable movie.
94741|1|Though the trailer for Once might pique your curiosity, you don't know the freight train of raw emotion that's about to blindside you.
17927|0|I wonder who the movie was made for.
58|1|A pleasant if undemanding piece of work that is diverting to sit through though it won't stand up to any kind of rigorous examination.
88249|0|Unlike Franco's mop, no amount of teasing can keep this romance from falling flat.
88870|1|At its heart, this is actually an excellent film. But, as filmmakers seek to escalate the big action, believability suffers severely.
59464|1|Made in the mid-80s as a cash-in on the hip-hop explosion, the movie plays better now than it did then
95062|1|Not a backstage film for the ages, but it manages to be a bit more useful than the vast bulk of its stablemates.
36284|1|[The] complex seeming premise of Gossip is simple and clever in its presentation and development.
45279|0|Brian De Palma's (mostly unsuccessful) riff on Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo...
15883|1|The story is incidental -- the villain wants to abduct the talking ape for financial gain -- and thankfully the animatronics and computer effects aren't allowed to overwhelm the proceedings.
36807|1|Tem seus bons momentos.
66286|1|It certainly does entertain, particularly for those who consider a man chopping off the head of one of his friends...entertaining. Twice!
67472|0|Berry struggles to retain some shards of dignity as she dutifully plods through the contrivances of Gothika.
23696|1|For better or worse, Stepford Wives is classic Frank Oz. At times ludicrous and stereotypical, but always funny.
98353|1|A bit like a medley of greatest hits performed by a hot, young talent who brings a new vocal inflection to the tired, old standards.
100246|1|Kurosawa explores the maze of shame, honour, tragedy and pride, and the curious stigma attached to those who denounced the country's involvement in the war.
78767|1|A lively celebration of baseball as America's pastime set during an era where the game was at its peak.
16339|1|It's worth overlooking the movie's weaknesses for the sake of those strong, memorable performances from the stars.
73681|1|Preserving a strict unity of time and place, this stark tale of a young woman's decline into insanity is set in a summer home on a holiday island.
19983|0|Only in the highly orchestrated, surprisingly gory climax, wherein Chucky's plastic form takes on the sins of the flesh, is there a spark of originality.
24126|0|What's so amazing about the Police Academy movies is that they keep being made even though they stopped being funny after the hilarious original.
39608|0|What we have here is no less than the 30th anniversary rerelease of the infamous 70s gay-angst drama, Boys in the Band.
14044|1|The story's sickening spiral into madness is preserved.
29206|1|An anarchic, ground-breaking breath of fresh air that weaves a fictional romp around a chaotic day in the life of the Fab Four as they try to make it to their big show.
85647|0|The filmmakers lack the confidence to allow us the full measure of Rattigan's uniquely British sensibility.
31714|1|One of the greatest romantic comedies.
36002|0|Later does a lot of things right, which makes its third-act missteps even more frustrating.
79416|1|A compelling cinematic allegory from one of the great artists of the twentieth century.
96806|1|As scripted and directed by Mike Cahill, King of California reveals itself to be a moving, bemusing gem embellished by standout work from Douglas and the habitually marvellous Evan Rachel Wood.
83867|0|..while star Michelle Trachtenberg delivers a sincere, engaging performance, there's not a whole lot here to hold the interest of anyone outside the film's target demographic.
73022|1|Is more witty and poignant than warm and fuzzy.
64987|1|Incident at Oglala presents sufficient evidence to warrant a re-examination of Leonard Peltier's case.
21722|1|Ultimately it's all a bit predictable -- the cyclical story more or less ends where it begins -- but it's nevertheless a charming and delightful romp, with keen observations about character, time and place.
21588|0|All of the special effects in the world, and all of the great makeup, and all of the great Muppet creatures can't save a movie that has no clear idea of its own mission and no joy in its own accomplishment.
23564|1|Sandler proved last year that he can be believable as a real person, but if he insists on playing overblown caricatures, he may not get many more chances.
94523|0|Director Mike White is really good at creating an uneasy feeling in a normal setting. But the question remains, do you want him to?
17168|1|É realmente impressionante que dois jovens como Matt Damon e Ben Affleck tenham sido capazes de escrever um roteiro tão complexo quanto o de 'Gênio Indomável'.
71698|1|In a movie about the con, the play is to hustle the audience into thinking it's more than it is.
78518|1|Repeat of first film lacks charm. Not for kids.
19130|1|Expert performances from Donald Crisp, Walter Pidgeon, Maureen O'Hara, and a host of brilliant character actors enhance a magnificent movie experience.
64163|1|From one funny scene to another, Wedding throws so many laughs at the audience you can barely keep up.
74252|1|"Will Smith gives the performance of his career in a movie for which phrases like ""heart-warming"" and ""life-affirming"" were made."
8473|1|Music fans can bask in the tunes that continue to play out when the action gets sluggish.
46339|0|Entirely standard cop fare. And Don Johson is the cop.
32120|1|That which does not kill us makes us ... well, still alive.
84431|0|For all its pompous attempts at seriousness and emotional depth, Palindromes is actually a remarkably shallow affair.
92404|0|Of course there is nothing inherently wrong with preaching to the converted -- secular Hollywood does it all the time. But I confess I wish the movie had some of the passion of The Passion of the Christ.
75094|0|There are the makings of a great comedy here, but you will not find more than scattered hints of it.
12911|1|Few films are gripping and effective 82 years after their original release, but this one surely is.
88679|1|The best moments in the film are when Ellen Kuras's camera just sits there taking in the whole stage, the whole gorgeous ecosystem.
21049|1|A great-looking, colourful old-style classic.
20975|1|A thoroughly charming, immensely appealing mess of a movie, often high-spirited and witty, occasionally pretentious and flat, sometimes robustly funny and frequently unintelligible.
59470|0|There are plenty of other 'want to get out of the business' movies out there that are more interesting and intriguing.
66306|1|This material marks a gutsy, fascinating departure for Mr. Eastwood, and makes it clear that his directorial ambitions have by now outstripped his goals as an actor.
102500|1|David Fincher's epic doesn't wallow in nihilistic obsessions, but preached no comforting homily about life's rich pageant either. Life is feel-good in spurts - a series of oddly interconnected, occasionally elating moments that accumulate before death.
938|1|Screamers oozes atmosphere. It's a dark film that borrows heavily from the likes of the Alien films, Dune, Blade Runner, and John Carpenter's updated The Thing.
78238|0|The moral is that money can indeed buy happiness.
28662|1|It's too bad that Pakula allows this 1993 movie to dawdle after its climax, but prior to that he's adept at suggesting unseen menace and keeping things in motion.

102355|1|A film with a vibrant and current argument. [Full review in Spanish]
72172|1|Like a sturdy, well-observed short story, its narrative pieces put together with a plain elegance.
13313|1|Heathers, with all its flagrant masochism and violence, is a throwback to a more innocent time, where such films could be made and still be deemed over the top fantasy.
64638|1|Haneke brings his usual dark sensibility to bear on the multifaceted story, expressing the fractured quality of modern city life through scenes that wander through a labyrinth of missing links and lost connections.
44313|0|...plays out like Jerry Bruckheimer's table scraps-- going through the motions in a clueless fog of market-research statistics and demographic pandering.
43020|1|...not quite up to the originality of the first film, but its sheer exuberance is good enough to keep youngsters enthralled and most adults at least mildly entertained.
9012|1|Dark comedy. Film noir. Tragic romance. Hollywood satire. 'Sunset Boulevard' has it all.
55026|1|Though Lan Yu lacks a sense of dramatic urgency, the film makes up for it with a pleasing verisimilitude.
86008|0|Gilliam has a history of blaming studios when his films go wrong. But he has no one to blame but himself for this poisoned apple.
17067|0|Falta alma ao filme.
50104|1|For better or for worse, How High knows what its audience wants and serves it to them, straight up, without any sort of moral or ethical chaser.
4776|0|I want to know how clumsily delivering punch lines in halting English while playing a shrieking harpy is in any way Oscar-worthy.
97052|1|Writer-director Richard Kelly throws a lot at the wall. The problem, if that's what we should call it, is that everything sticks. That's bad news for those who like some narrative clarity, and great news for those who enjoy bonkers wall art.
16945|0|Mortal Kombat Annihilation features evil ninja monsters popping out of nowhere. If at first these villains appear absolutely unbeatable, just wait a minute and you'll see them cower before our determined, team-oriented good guys.
99421|0|...one of those bird-brained contrivances that would be over in no time if any of the characters had a lick of sense...
48905|1|Not a great movie, although Drew Barrymore shines.
88885|0|It's like those cartoon chase sequences where the scrolling background is on a loop. Here, the characters are on a loop, and the backgrounds change.
87512|0|Words and letters may hold all the secrets of the universe, but 104 minutes wasn't enough to hold and resolve all the secrets and mysteries of Bee Season.
11317|1|Suffers due to its incredible length and slow pace, but intriguing, nonetheless.
77470|0|Not just a matter of falling short of fulfilling potential; this is a genuinely irritating, over-blown movie.
73319|1|It is mostly tongue-in-cheek.
40958|1|Tom Hanks' powerful, brutal and mature story.
99944|1|[A] quietly observant and quite beautiful adaptation of the Monica Ali novel.
72958|1|Pierrot is a self conscious mash up of every movie genre that Godard loves, of every movie he has made, of all the artistic references (music, painting, literature) that have influenced or affected him
102228|1|Cameron is genuinely compelling as Caleb, a work-obsessed firefighter on the verge of divorce from his neglected wife.
32753|1|You'll be reaching for your hanky and wondering why movies can't always be this good.
18377|0|Any expression beyond a sullen pout seems to take an extraordinary amount of concentration and physical exertion on Van Dien's part; his infrequent attempts at smiles are the stuff nightmares are made of.
99045|1|Smart and well-written, filled with good lines and just enough offbeat moments to make it interesting, not annoying.
64908|1|I was pretty sure that I had heard everything that I wanted to hear about this 'unfortunate incident', but after watching this documentary, I realized that I was wrong - I want the truth.
40894|0|This movie doesn't pretend to be substantial, but it's still just barely passable as light fare.
93030|1|After the Wedding is seamless, holding our attention, engaging our emotions and satisfying our cinematic needs with a story of human weakness, strength, heart and the capriciousness of fate
58501|1|...though the movie does overstay its welcome, it's never boring and the majority of the music is infectiously catchy...
22536|1|Makepeace is excellent as the slight protagonist, and Baldwin is perfect as the brooding, misunderstood mammoth.
62168|1|A tightly packed little snowball of a comedy that picks up steam as it rolls along.
83295|1|"In a movie where the film's trailer has spoiled all its best scenes, and the onscreen chemistry between our primary lovebirds is a failed experiment, it's refreshing that ""Hitch"" still provides that rare buoyant romantic lift that the genre promises."
50796|1|Really very good.
46326|0|Emile Ardolino, who directed Dirty Dancing, leaves the film hovering halfway between dewy romance and bedroom farce, but he displays little of the sharpness or comic timing needed for either one.
2844|1|This is the best type of documentary, giving an intensely personal story you can't help but become involved in, and also raises fundamental issues about America in the 90s.
68185|1|By the time the credits roll, we’ve had a whirlwind tour of virtually everything you can do in a Western.
95822|0|It isn't funny; it isn't touching; there's a screamingly annoying and supercilious voiceover-narration, and all its dramatic ideas are bafflingly unfinished and unresolved.
83222|0|Too often, Purple Butterfly is as impenetrable as Zhang's placid, obdurate beauty.
36643|0|This slow and talky sitcom may leave its paying customers feeling Held Up.
32213|1|Writer-director Robbins serves up a hearty helping of history, politics and star power.
58075|0|Never having seen the first two films in the series, I can't compare Friday After Next to them, but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days.
28224|0|Your typical 80s nightmare. Fox does NOT work as a rock star.
89275|0|Before he started turning out $200 million fantasy epics, Peter Jackson used to do this sort of thing while napping, and he was much better at it.
85082|0|This wincingly earnest comedy-drama could rival the maple tree as Canada's leading producer of sap.
101203|0|Watching the movie, even when it's not working -- which is a lot of the time -- one doesn't tire of McBride.
82848|1|Shameless but effective weepie about wayward orphans
82806|0|The only thing that keeps us engaged is the cute factor.
42130|1|A two-word review: Chris rocks.
26788|0|This has an appealing two-dimensional comic-book look, but lacks the vision to go with it, not to mention an interesting hero or a feeling for action.
85013|1|...there's little doubt that the film is occasionally just a little too uneventful for its own good.
43058|1|It is a raw, intermittently brilliant film that heralds a sort of renaissance in Mexican film.
16591|1|"Among the very best of all the original ""thoughtful"" sci-fi movies out there."
24839|0|Well, I know a movie is not worth seeing if I can't work up the energy to write about it for two weeks.
52071|0|It really is a stinker.
26777|1|"""Dick Tracy"" isn't in the top tier of comic-book adaptations, but ingenuous art direction and set decoration and some crazy make-up jobs create a film that's still a delight to watch."
42618|1|Just how much are you willing to forgive Johnny Depp and that sea-dog swagger of his?
33280|0|This shoddiest of sequels should be the last act for these sorry Sisters.
87710|1|Abu-Assad does a good job of building tension and showing some of the complexities within Palestinian culture. He has, as they say, put a human face on the Palestinians.
91646|1|Public Enemies is an enjoyable experience but it feels like it could have been a whole lot more and another gangster classic.
56841|1|Not a great movie, but it's a top tier punk rock tribute.
95554|0|I'm sure a lot of people will find it thrilling. Me, I just wanted to get headache [or] seasickness tablets.
39135|1|The battles between the imperious Hepburn and the presumed-mad Taylor are pure theatricality, while sensitive shrink Clift observes it all and emotes.
283|1|A host of fine performances support the great screenplay, photography and editing of the film.
76880|0|Humorous to an extent, but lacking the bang you might expect from a big screen musical.
101385|0|Strictly for romantic masochists. Enough tears in the final reel to fill a Hollywood producer's swimming pool.
26397|1|It's a fresh, bang-for-your-buck kind of movie. Parents will hate it.
48067|0|A sugary, over-produced power ballad of a movie.
102067|1|An elegant exercise with four characters trapped by class, guilt and greed.
58617|1|one of those European genre films that look much superior to Hollywood even when they are obviously below the standards of genre excellence
55727|1|Alec Guinness' sharp bird nose and watery eyes helped him play characters who were misfits on the margins of society. He made for a kindly but stubborn rebel in the Ealing comedies.
79287|0|pot-boiler with Crawford chewing up the scenery; Garfield does his best to retain his dignity.
32930|0|More an imitation than a parody, this would-be comedy is very short on laughs and gives away virtually all of them in its coming-attractions trailer.
1069|1|...a solid thriller that neatly and efficiently gets the job done...
92863|1|The plot was stomped on a bit, but it is watchable.
52498|1|I was actually entertained and amused; but overall the movie is adequate and little more.
58446|1|An acerbic British black comedy.
7423|1|Minimalism defines this revisionist and challenging noir- Western, a welcome artistic departure from Jarmusch's increasingly tired and tiresome Downtown New York sensibility.
5169|0|Is this a thriller? You've never scene a 'suspense film' drag its heels so deplorably, enlivened only by some colorful character acting.
9565|1|...entertaining enough to warrant a mild recommendation...
41413|1|If you're looking for nonstop, no-holds-barred exploitation, look no further. Pam Grier's first solo starring role is an enormously entertaining black action classic.
31422|0|Shea's arty-trashy exploitation film is an amalgam of Fatal Attraction, Stepfather, and Pasolini's Teorema, in all of which the order of a middle-class is disrupted by a depraved interloper, if only the script were better
67991|0|Annaud and his collaborators have got all of the physical details just right, but there is a failure of the imagination here; we do not sense the presence of real people behind the attractive facades of the two main actors.
14869|1|One of the funniest movies ever made, 'Waiting for Guffman' spoofs everything from documentaries and talent shows to local politics and alien abductions.
28142|1|Spielberg adapts Alice Walker's novel with respect and (heretofore unseen) mature artistry.
34999|0|A movie like this has only one not-so-noble reason to exist: to make us sob. And it just doesn't deliver the goods.
35052|0|Really stupid.
41103|0|...it's just so dull...
23620|1|It's not a bad film for what it is.
2215|1|Posey's romp through this film is probably the best thing about Party Girl; she just may be the next 'It' girl.
19687|1|A trip, for sure, but a worthy one.
86214|1|The film's strength is that it isn't hesitant to name names on either end of the political spectrum
9923|1|...exactly the sort of easy-going, endlessly engaging family film that seems to have become an unusually rare breed in this day and age.
60963|0|A mixed bag.
261|1|Production values are brilliant, and as the drug-addict-hooker Sharon Stone gives her best performance, but thematically, Scorsese rehashes grounds that he had explored deeper in previous films (GoodFellas) and his approach here is too cold and remote.
15673|1|Dream With the Fishes is a personal kind of story told with a sensitivity that, while not exactly Oscar-worthy, does manage to touch on feelings most mainstream films don't even admit exist.
87439|0|Fans of the original stage production won't be disappointed, but as a film it's frequently tedious and way too long.
93589|0|Things in the movie, like the slasher movie music cues, hint that Karla has exploitation in its veins. The reasons for making it -- and seeing it -- remain more than slightly suspect.
69551|1|The film -- although slight -- works wonderfully.
3938|1|An interesting look at the Beatle who never was.
19405|1|Four decades after its initial release, William Friedkin's Oscar-sweeper The French Connection remains an electrifying achievement.
65450|1|So Close is executed with so much style and expertise that it's bound to end up a guilty-pleasure favorite.
11698|1|It would seem from a spate of films lately that the English can only find their warmer, truer selves abroad -- usually in Italy. Enchanted April takes this familiar path, but traipses along with charm and glory, as if for the very first time.
8782|1|It Happened One Night is one of the easiest movies to love and one of the hardest to think of as a work of art.
71395|1|Carregado de tensão sexual, o filme analisa os intensos conflitos que ocorrem sob a superfície pacata de uma cidadezinha e impressiona graças às fortes atuações - não é à toa que cinco integrantes do elenco foram indicados ao Oscar.
67095|1|Lanzmann slowly, cumulatively colors in a vast canvas on mass murder.
45136|1|'Time, if anything, will vindicate Douglas Sirk,' wrote Andrew Sarris in 1968. He was right.
81273|0|This film will be a real disappointment for its lack of logic and even the misunderstanding of the original story.
49681|0|As a documentary on the USS Nimitz, The Final Countdown is wonderful. As entertainment, however, it has the feeling of a telepic that strayed onto the big screen.
70098|1|Bogart is in his usual metier, a tough guy who, no less, has the facility of making a dame go for him, instead of he for her. That's where Bacall comes in.
78139|0|While the atmosphere is excellent, and the general elements all strong, the film sadly fails to give any real insight or depth in regards to explaining the hows and whys of the near fever over the game and its players.
92779|1|The son of an Egyptian immigrant, the Minnesota born Selim demonstrates a startling intimacy and empathy for his characters, but infuses his story with a candid tough love for their weaknesses.
43337|1|If you're an admirer of [Mamet's] work, or if you're willing to be as patiently observant as Dale, you will find much that is fascinating and illuminating.
19552|1|The expanse of time is saturated with an expanse of visual beauty that feels absolutely right for the story.
82563|0|It's definitely all true, but it's not all that interesting.
99883|1|This is an exciting flick, and it helped secure a place in the cinemas for R-rated action films.
12546|1|Symbolism-filled classic a tough sell for kids.
72649|1|Much aided by its magnificent central performances, Penn's adaptation works like a dream as a film...Despite the subject matter, Penn manages to resist the temptation to manipulate our emotions.
92590|0|McConaughey campily channels Jon Stewart channeling George W. Bush for his impersonation of Lengyel.
52302|1|A small gem from Belgium.
39005|1|unpretentious documentary that gives us a much deeper understanding of a most intriguing icon
16450|1|Affleck and Lee have a great comic thing going on.
88148|1|The major asset of Michael Powell's expectedly propagandistic British film, which was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar (under the title The Invaders) is its accomplished ensemble, including Olivier and Eric Porter.
96258|0|It's for those who remember the days when the bad guy at school wasn't just the bully in the next seat, but an ex-jock whose life peaked when they were 17 and who now possesses the authority that comes with age, position and a whistle.
45199|1|A commanding blend of the high and low, a thoroughly sordid family melodrama designed for over-literate history buffs.
47526|1|The characters, irritating as they can be at first, grow on you as they grow up.
8489|0|Without question one of the stupidest comedies I've ever seen.
36363|1|Few cinema artists have delved into their own lives and emotions with such ruthlessness and with such moving results.
57983|1|A grinning, bare-chested Douglas Fairbanks shimmies up a rope and enters a room in the palace, intending to steal a casket of baubles. Instead, his eyes fall on Princess Julanne Johnston... Of such things movie myths are made.
43614|1|A complete joy from start to finish! See it before you take to the wide-open road!
78364|1|Bell is superb as Chris and he completely nails the difficult Southern accent; if you hadn't seen Billy Elliot, you'd swear he was someone Green had picked off the street
15706|1|The animation is kinetic and witty; computer effects are integrated to good effect without overwhelming the hand-drawn figures.
53203|0|Is authenticity too much to ask? It's not as if the various drug subcultures don't have enough humor and tragedy built in that you need to take a detour into Fantasyland.
43469|0|"Vampire movies are almost by definition cheesy, but ""The Forsaken"" is a lot cheesier than most."
27244|1|In many ways the first modern war film.
15695|0|Amusing, yes. Fluffy, definitely. But with no more staying power than those Hercules action figures that were already resigned to Odd-Lot by last Christmas.
89144|1|By far the best film of this first half of 2006.
18369|1|...crude and bloody but effective action comedy...
21212|1|A dumb but fun comedy that is infinitely more tolerable than Martin's later work
5857|1|Some movies with great potential can be ruined or denied their greatness by a single detail.
24684|1|The coincidences that make the destined lovers' paths cross aren't contrived with much finesse, but the characters get in some decidedly clever lines.
51748|0|A stylish bit of modern anime despite a finale that muddles its momentum.
78533|0|"Oscar winner Jim Broadbent turns up long enough to say, ""I wish I was dead."""
102129|1|Unashamedly old-fashioned and corny, if not quite up to the director's usual high standards.
78256|0|full review in Greek
101672|0|Unfortunately, Rosenberg directs flatly, hopping from one set piece to the next, disjointedly throwing characters of varying interest across Newman's path.
89649|1|A character-driven, martial arts adventure more concerned with motivations than karate moves.
84768|0|Intriguing, then, mainly for historical and comparison purposes.
93104|1|It's a love letter of the first degree, the kind that rises out of trepidation and confusion, almost by accident, with a sudden force of absolute clarity.
60166|1|Colombani's double-sided view of events works like a jigsaw puzzle, but you may get the chills every time you learn where a new piece connects to an earlier one.
43261|0|In the end, the plot is revealed and everything is wrapped up just like an episode of Scooby Doo. But not after the bumbling Tara Reid tortures us with her ditziness.
15200|0|A cobbled-together mess of conflicting tones.
42924|1|Memento is one of those jigsaw puzzles whose pieces snap together more tightly with each viewing. Fueling it all is a performance by Guy Pearce that's as indelible as the tattoo ink covering his body.
67378|1|It's a perfectly respectable debut for Curtis.
37876|1|James Bridges manages to do a fair job with the semihokey material.
70493|0|If you're going to mismatch director and material so thoroughly, try getting it even more drastically wrong, like hiring Gaspar Noe or Neil LaBute.
54332|0|Everyone's creative burners were on low heat for this woeful outing.
31952|0|Despite Charlize Theron's efforts to play more than a saintly martyr, the film's director Niki Caro continually overstates the case.
60742|1|This splendid film is no mere polemic, for Rakhshan Bani-Etemad, often called the first lady of Iranian cinema, is above all an accomplished storyteller and dramatist who understands the evocative power of sound and image.
67544|0|An irritating experience
46714|0|The fact that this movie contains some of the most annoying, mannered actors on film today and still remains painless is quite a feat.
62331|0|Below-average for series and too violent for younger kids.
57946|0|...an uneven piece of work...
43274|1|Develops an uncommonly warm and compassionate tone.
46833|0|This titter-worthy picture is basically like 1988's Cocktail with multiple fractures added for good measure.
96803|0|The clunky King of California leaves you with all the satisfaction of hitting caliche in your backyard.
42148|1|A fast paced actioner built around the growing solidarity between the kids and the teachers.
22355|0|This early Hitchcock talkie shows none of the mastery that would subsequently make the director an internationally recognized genius.
80388|1|It is beautifully lensed and comes across as a kind of giant Renaissance canvas.
35169|0|slick, Joel Silver-produced action movie with a borderline straight to video feel.
39148|0|I expected to hear canned laughter to really give it the full TV sitcom treatment.
56308|1|"""Hamlet"" done by Canadian drunks! Absolute genius!"
76268|1|An adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's legendary play results in a stage-bound production lifted by grand performances, including the delightful Katharine Hepburn.
89233|0|At least Larry the Cable Guy's brief movie career kept Hollywood's fart-sound proprietors in business. What, you thought an opening shot of his bared plumber's crack was an arbitrary artistic decision? That there's foreshadowin' right there!
17625|1|One of those rare movies that I know I shouldn't like, but... I cannot help but enjoy it.
43479|0|If Rashomon were filmed through a shampoo bottle, you'd have some idea what to expect from the surprisingly mean-spirited comedy, One Night at McCool's.
43029|1|Boorman has crafted a witty, classy and richly enjoyable morality play, which skewers the mercenary self-interest behind Anglo-American imperialism almost as an afterthought.
45795|0|Bad, bad, bad. Stick to hosting late-night creature features, babe.
65979|1|The director captures the worst-case scenario of what might happen at the dawn of the video era, going all the way back to our parents' warning us not to sit too close to the television.
44685|1|Pootie Tang works, in part, because it doesn't. Which is to say the movie's special success is inextricable from the moments where it blatantly fails. The movie exerts a beguiling charm that can only be explained as the je ne sais quoi of sa da tay.
77272|1|how the mighty have fallen
59686|0|The film soon becomes repetitious, lacking the overall atmosphere of paranoia that makes Spillane's fictions bearable.
65569|1|It is a work of great entertainment, a product of an era when people looked up at a screen and saw movies instead of cinema.
60308|1|. When all is said and done, The Life of David Gale is thus only worth about $8.50 on a cheap Tuesday. .
20100|1|...
11410|1|Liam Neeson delivers a fearless portrait of a unique individual.
85093|1|It's worth seeking out this bittersweet comedy with its emotionally resonant story and stellar performances.
72789|1|A harrowing odyssey of four derelicts inching two trucks loaded with nitro-glycerine over a tortuous terrain puts this in the strong meat department with a downbeat theme of fear and its manifestations.
25405|0|Unfortunately, not a good picture.
76554|0|"The ""wow"" kind of bad that people still talk about 20 years after the fact. Rent it and see."
34471|1|Dash has created a cinematic essay that immerses her audience in a world no other film has explored.
82408|1|A lot like the comedian's best work: amusing, appropriate for kids, and far more spiritually nourishing and less insulting than typical Hollywood fare.
20732|1|'Maybe we thought the world would end,' Mitchum muses, during a short-lived spell of happiness in Mexico. 'Maybe we thought it was a dream.' A dream? In his trench coat and fedora, he's clearly not a man destined to die quietly in his bed.
22429|1|A smart and creepy thriller transposing a classic London tale to in-your-face modern Los Angeles. Helmer David Ondaatje's deft handling of actors and subtle twists demand a second viewing.
9064|1|All About Eve is not only a brilliant and clever portrait of an actress, it is a downright funny film, from its opening scene to the final fadeout.
10477|0|There isn't a brain in its empty little head, or in its assembly-line story, which is about how Charlie Sheen pauses occasionally between ludicrous action scenes, some of them ripped off from better films.
52056|1|The first critics to lay eyes on it mistook the emphasis on the personal and painterly for self-indulgence - static naval gazing. This confuses incident with the incidental.
230|0|Geena Davis brings girl power to the pirate ship.
39056|1|A consistently hilarious assemblage of highlights from the hit concert tour of the same name.
85345|0|Fantastic Four is actually very true to its source material - often literally so - but generally misses the spirit entirely.
55703|0|Everybody in and around this movie is trying too hard.
29049|1|Incredibly lowbrow, but many teens will love it.
88940|0|Free Zone has a somewhat challenging narrative made more problematic by the difficulty involved in caring about the characters.
49881|1|The core pleasure of the film is the complex and precise performance by the underrated talent Channing.
9080|1|It crackles with smart, smarting dialogue.
69954|1|The final shot is one of the most convincingly grief-stricken in cinema.
1710|0|I won't say I didn't enjoy it; this is the kind of film that begs to be talked back to, that satisfies our highly developed taste for schadenfreude.
92026|0|Apartheid revisited, less as a repugnant racist ideology than as an ethically ambivalent philosophy.
63983|0|Unfortunately, the showcase is rather truncated insofar as there is not much true talent on display.
42259|0|I left hoping that I never see either of them again in anything.
83080|0|saddest thing about this unpleasant, mirthless film is that it's photographed by Anthony Richmond.
95890|0|This Sentence is as grisly and violent as the trailer portends.
87542|1|As played by Murphy in what is an excellent performance, Kitten is sort of like a transvestite superhero--able to overcome impossible situations and look fabulous while doing it.
53885|1|A funny and tense thriller with an excellent performance by Robin Tunney...
100846|0|It never even gestures at the philosophical heavy lifting of exploring alternate interpretations of ambiguous events.
54206|1|John Sayles has crafted a bleak, not-so-happy view of what many parts of the sunshine state are really like as developers snap up and exploit what hasn't already been turned into a theme park, resort, or retirement community.
93722|1|If anything, the film's uplifting moral tone seems more in line with a Frank Capra flick than a cinematic sermon.
96443|0|But Rendition, in the end, is a Lifetime movie with pretensions toward being a political thriller. (They could even call it YOU HAVE MY HUSBAND! since Witherspoon shrieks that at Streep in a ludicrous scene.)
80495|0|It lacks [My Favourite Year's] winning charm.
24626|1|Portrays a self-absorbed young man's growth into maturity as he draws closer to his elderly father.
94480|0|Bored. Bored witless.
76023|1|This is an unusual comedy picture, a novelty melange of dramatics, low comedy, laughs and thrills. Jean Havez has built up a comedy masterpiece about as serious a subject as a feud.
8409|1|It's the kind of story that leaves viewers with a warm glow.
690|0|Forgettable.
78932|0|A bland documentary if ever there was one.
21068|0|A film that does not seem to know whether it wants to be genuinely frightening or a fantasy fable.
79327|1|Easter Parade may not strike the perfect balance between song-dance interludes and story, but it's an appealing show just the same.
73513|1|the first film to touch on many of Kurosawa's themes unfettered
32379|0|Robin Williams cae en el tipo de personaje que ha venido interpretando hasta el cansancio: el del hombre bueno que es todo emociones y que es capaz de llorar amargamente
34955|0|In short, this movie could be recommended only to the most fanatical Charles Bronson fans or for the people who are already desperate for 1980s nostalgia.
7016|0|It doesn't matter if you love music or inspirational stories or Robin Williams (anyone?) -- this is enough to make your teeth ache.
62443|1|Surprisingly gratifying ... In a summer full of computer-generated, nu-metal-accompanied kicks to the midsection, this may be the closest you'll get to drawing room grace.
59504|1|'Make no mistake, without the slicing, dicing, filleting, and pureeing, this flick is a recipe for boredom. But like its predecessor, I was expecting a bloodless teen snorefest and got something several sanguineous degrees better!'
31758|1|Beatty mercilessly lampoons his own offscreen image in a bumptious comedy of manners that turns persuasively sombre at the end.
16485|0|This discreet drama failed to get to me emotionally.
96441|0|Rather then telling a story with characters growing and exploring the politics of the world around them, they simply take up the roles of well-dictated automatons.
97219|0|Less painful than having your chest cut open, but a disagreeable experience just the same.
61699|1|With a serious and even terrifying theme, this excursion into science fiction has been thoughtfully directed by Francois Truffaut and there is adequate evidence of light touches to bring welcome and needed relief to a sombre and scarifying subject.
94800|1|"Ultimately, ""Gracie"" scores as a feminist inspirational sports film."
72859|1|Very funny, early Steve Martin comedy. Has some great bits including a gag with spary-on sweat and another with cardboard stand-ups doubling as friends for lonely guys. Not Martin's funniest film, but it's up there.
28269|1|Fall-down funny laughs!
88744|0|Alyson Hannigan deserves better. In fact, we all deserve better than DATE MOVIE, a slow-witted assembly of every date movie joke we've already seen.
58987|1|For all the food for thought offered by the film, its overall success is diminished by the fact that there's too much Max and not enough Hitler.
102437|1|Un relato sensible y sutil sobre la reconstrucción de un vínculo interrumpido traumáticamente. Más que atendible debut en la dirección del escritor Philippe Claudel, con estupendas actuaciones de sus protagonistas femeninas.
70238|0|Miiki holds up violence as a virtue, in this nonconformist cartoon-like ode to ultra-violence, sadism and masochism.
75620|0|The politically connotative mechanics of the plot are utterly superfluous--a good 3/4th of the plot is of a throwaway nature.
68361|0|If Betty Blue teaches us anything -- and there's a good chance it doesn't -- it's that life is full of little mysteries.
93544|0|All the characters feel superficial, a sensation heightened by a roster of too-cute secondary characters.
64054|1|Thoroughly compelling documentary.
90167|0|So awkwardly directed by star Chester that its timing and tone are hopelessly uneven.
10762|1|As far as a coherent, hilarious story line, as well as sheer blasphemous glee, you can't do much better than Life of Brian.
71533|1|Bold stylistic decisions reinforce the themes of the narrative, while a strong story and convincing performances prove equal to the task of carrying such an extended running time.
38271|1|A film much more entertaining than you'd expect, even if only two of its seven sequences individually reach classic status.
77247|0|Wicker Park frustrates to no end when a smidgen of common sense on anyone's behalf would clear up everything.
7685|1|Hilarious, bitingly perceptive and cinematically assured.
48392|1|Quadrophenia succeeds through its devil-may-care attitude and energy. It feels like a low-budget homemade movie from the period.
60228|1|The first and the best of the three romantic comedies Doris Day made with Rock Hudson at Universal offers a good case of deconstructing the stars' respective screen images.
37477|1|Cheesy, witty, enjoyable Arnold pic.
72527|1|It's beautiful to look at, the acting is superb and it has its poignant moments.
20132|0|There's a mischievous playfulness about Gremlins, and that's its most endearing quality, but I found it grating on me early on and soon turning to mean-spiritedness.
85652|1|The subject matter might be quite disturbing to some, but for those who don't mind a little child-rape with their crack-smoking, The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things is well worth a look.
63813|1|The movie, a keen look at the way passion unravels and obsession destroys, creates a black mood, a sense of truth and an enduring chill that stay with you.
19182|1|Taken as a treatise on addiction generally, it's remarkably sensitive and thoughtful.
11488|1|Thrilling boxing docu covers race, politics; some profanity.
1982|1|Whenever Zucker stops piling on battle scenes as if he were directing Braveheart, his film casts a romantic spell.
8089|0|Dismal.
55803|0|The performances are easy to love while the story is not.
62381|0|Humdrum direction fails to elevate an already bankrupt idea from its relentless doldrums.
41215|0|...an incredibly uneven flick.
36963|1|Gives one a greater sense of Chaplin's political breadth from his previous work.
100746|0|These Pants are torn and frayed.
94951|1|A happy 85 minutes, although it might have been a teensy bit happier, banishing all hint of repetition, at 75.
78956|1|One of the earliest films that takes misogyny and sexual repression as its subject.
33960|1|Taut, brutal Western with King Lear overtones
17976|1|John Hillcoat's violence-probing Western feels as uncompromisingly bleak, royally widescreen and graphically violent as any Sam Peckinpah opus - a sunburned, grimy-nailed saga of point-blank executions and blood wrung from a cat o' nine tails.
30284|0|Most people who see Julien Donkey-Boy will leave the theater disturbed and it will take a special kind of odd-movie aficionado to appreciate the feeling.
55378|0|A reasonably diverting videogame of a movie but not successful entertainment.
101807|1|Breaks no new ground for movies or for Ritchie, but it is an amusing diversion and therefore a return to form. [Blu-ray]
22208|0|It seems that neither Miss Bergman nor Mr. Hitchcock has tangled here with stuff of any better than penny-dreadful substance and superfical demands.
4292|1|Facetious and cynical, Mel Gibson's star vehicle is glossy and superficially enteratining, but doesn't begin to approximate the charm of James Garner and the original TV series.
83444|1|Vintage mind-thrills in slinky, shadowy black and white.
81131|1|Suspenseful and psychologically rich.
6530|1|Ghost is a dazzlingly enjoyable pop thriller.
49906|0|Who was Piñero, and more to the point, why should we care? Bratt brings him to life, but we come away appreciating his genius no more than we did before.
6836|0|The conceit of having everyone talk together almost exclusively by cell phone wears out its welcome by the halfway mark.
29639|0|There's really no reason for anyone to see this film except die hard Shannon fans.
48968|0|Too often the uneven script is either hopelessly strained or tediously lackadaisical.
53364|0|Both half-hearted and half-assed
14615|1|A unique survival film, that has become a cult favorite.
22261|1|The movie has its enjoyable, even humorous moments, but the brooding sense of danger and fear so prominent in his other films, are more noticeably absent.
14007|1|Deserved better reviews than it got when it came out.
60956|1|"Apart from my disappointment that Roger Moore didn't use any funny Bond-related lines (let's face it, ""license to drill"" or ""for your eyes only"" would have been hilarious coming out of his mouth), the movie more than exceeded my expectations."
33739|0|Boyle takes a seriously wrong turn in the closing third of the film.
32391|1|Stuart is an animation wonder - his tiny face is more expressive than most Hollywood stars'.
85720|0|Secuestro Express is a wake-up call for wealthy clubgoers who party in the slums of Caracas. For anyone else, it's bad pulp that glorifies 'gangster' culture.
30787|1|Grisly thriller with great performances; not for kids.
79553|1|Preminger's visual savvy turns that most staid and insufferable of social terrariums, the floor of the U.S. Senate, into a vibrant, perpetually shifting Voronoi diagram.
48189|1|"Bravura cinematic spectacle with just enough literary antecedent and social commentary that it doesn't come across as shallow as the word ""spectacle"" implies."
25680|0|I'd like to think the project would have fared better in more eclectic hands, say Gus Van Sant, or perhaps Roman Polanski, but what's done is done and what's done is maybe not what it could have been.
66213|1|Mostly dead-on and characteristically Pythonesque.
44762|0|Essentially this is Espagnole on repeat, as if the lessons from the former film had been fully expunged after five years on ice.
57870|0|Return to the Blue Lagoon is a pointless spinoff of the 1980 hit, which was itself a remake of a 1949 British pic.
14878|1|Everyone will think it's funny; people who've actually done community theatre will laugh themselves into a coma.
98815|1|Following the harrowing and superbly made opening sequences of hand to hand combat in Iraq, we can feel the frustrations and the anger through the film, and we sympathise. But the film has a confused message ...
73949|1|One of Val Lewton's final films, this collaboration with Boris Karloff is also one of his most tragically underrated.
91583|1|Watching the unique explosions of Guillermo del Toro's mind realise themselves on screen is truly astounding.
80811|1|Combining exquisite animation, (slyly subverted) Boys' Own action, and (barely concealed) adult themes, Porco Rosso goes the whole hog, offering anti-war escapades that will appeal to all ages.
39843|1|The director's new masterpiece is a summation of nearly everything he has learned as a filmmaker, and about black culture, but he doesn't feel the need to beat the audience over the head for each lesson he's trying to impart.
88525|1|There's zero chemistry between the leads; for all their passionate declarations of love, you never believe they've even spoken to each other before the cameras start turning over.
73128|1|Sly may be a crass tyrannosaurus, but he's not a fake
12791|1|"Like ""Casablanca,"" ""Chinatown"" (1974) represents a perfect storm of prodigious cinema talent coming together under an intoxicating noir setting, albeit of neo noir influence attributed to by the warm California sun."
45589|1|Odd blend of comedy and terrorizing between Broderick and Walken.
67716|1|The movie was advertised (no doubt wisely) as a slam-bang action adventure, but in fact it's a serious, smart film with an impact that lingers after the lights go up.
23373|0|Soldier didn't deserve to be treated so harshly critics, but it didn't deserve recommendations either.
14554|0|There are many ... instances when you want to run screaming from Elsinore Castle.
5105|0|It's a real pity, because Reiner has certainly been funnier and more inventive on other outings and Sherilyn Fenn makes a winsome gal Friday.
98016|0|More of the same hollow irony Black practises as VH1's resident Mike Nelson
15173|1|I have to admit that I generally don't like Jim Carrey but I thoroughly enjoyed Liar, Liar.
70349|1|Starring Dick Van Dyke, this pleasant family fable with music was nominated for the Best Song Oscar
57238|0|Three things can be counted on from Warner Bros. and Dark Castle's annual Halloween release: (1) a lot of spiffy special effects; (2) a fair amount of gore; and (3) not one single scare.
101318|1|An amiably paced, character-driven comedy-drama about a disenchanted student who finds himself among the unreconstructed hippies and second-generation fringe dwellers who farm marijuana in the Lost Coast region of Northern California.
26913|0|The signs of laziness set in almost immediately.
65696|1|Displaying what is both good and bad about Allen, Anything Else has enough laugh out loud moments to make it worthwhile.
35481|1|Black is terrific as the obnoxious Barry, who abuses customers ignorant enough to come in and ask for 'I Just Called To Say I Love You', while Louiso is almost as good as the mousy but equally snobbish Dick.
98460|1|If you didn't know that Romero himself directed this film, you would think it had been fashioned by some brilliant young wunderkind director, reared on Romero's work and eager to stake out his own claim to the territory.
7716|1|Never less than enthusiastically fascinating
73254|0|Too long and too ridiculous.
93940|0|"By painting in such broad strokes and playing up race-baiting that Ellis says he didn't experience, are they not couching the movie as somehow uniquely ""black""?"
75407|1|An occasion to meditate upon the frightfulness of heroin addiction and why many youth opt for the euphoria of white powder rather than the promises of the American dream.
23234|1|Not unlike The Miracle Worker, this teacher-student-breakthrough movie updates the genre with several changes: the teacher (William Hurt) is an unconventional male, the student (Marlee Matlin) is an attractive female, and their relationship involves sex.
55124|1|There is little question that this is a serious work by an important director who has something new to say about how, in the flip-flop of courtship, we often reel in when we should be playing out.
67638|1|"Truly the overall film is quite good, but the audience will likely be moved to unintended laughter on occasion and the film is sometimes too surreally silly to truly feel as ""dark"" as Darkman."
57784|1|I like it better than the problematic Fort Apache; it's far simpler and more effective.
79108|1|Garbo seems to be dying of an unspecified movie disease where star power is more apparent than actual illness. Issues of plausibility do not, however, get in the way of the snappy dialogue, which is a big surprise for such a standard melodrama.
20193|1|Sheryl Lee, as the cop who Billy Zane is scamming and sleeping with gives such a terrible performance that is simultaneously absolutely perfect. She's the most accurate representative of the movie as a whole.
87591|1|"""The Libertine"" in question here is John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester, a poet and member of the Reformation court of King Charles II."
35004|1|The most brilliantly insane pop-star movie ever, lensed by Spielberg regular Janusz Kaminski and loaded with stylistic strangeness. Ice Rules!
64703|1|With his first movie for a major studio, Meyer simply did what he'd been doing for years, only bigger and better.
27896|1|How many laughs can you get out of a handful of one-joke characters? Well, if your ensemble contains the talents of Janeane Garofalo, William H. Macy, Hank Azaria and Ben Stiller, the answer is: a lot.
16393|1|By-the-book romantic comedy with great scenery, cute story, and engaging characters.
85614|1|Firefly finally has the triumphant finale fans longed for: the excitingly tense, often surprising and even more frequently comical Serenity. Fans will rejoice.
54414|1|Feels like a late-baby-boomer family album.
17247|1|This is one of the best films of the year, an unflinching lament for the human condition.
17628|1|98 minutes of pure, unadulterated exhilaration.
11445|1|There's a semblance of a plot, but this is really just an excuse for the boys to engage in their unique brand of humor, which includes mimicry, dress-up, dry wit, slapstick and glorious non sequitors.
59053|0|The story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin.
48960|1|A sexy, mildly entertaining import.
16182|1|Director-writer Gus Van Sant sets up disturbing -- and, often, oddly comic -- situations and then gives his characters (and actors) the freedom to explore them.
42741|1|Irons founds his adroit performance, from cadaverous countenance to crooked pinky, on strangled passion and noblesse oblige. And astonishingly, he manages to make old Claus oddly pathetic, even sympathetic.
31378|1|Sharply written and executed with real verve, this is an enduring and enjoyable comedy-drama that showcases some great performances both on and off-stage.
59423|1|Penn burrows inside his character, capturing not only Milk's Long Island Jewish intonations and his gay body language but also the intensity of his beliefs and the particular mix of fear and desire through which he viewed the world.
5500|1|It's somehow reassuring, these days, to see a movie where there's no problem Lassie can't solve.
2466|0|Burnt by the Sun was not the best of the nominated foreign films (Before the Rain deserved to win), and is not even very original.
78933|0|There's really nothing more here than you can find watching dreadful political advertisements and dreadful political talk shows.
58708|0|Two icons of romantic comedy team up for the first time, and the result is a fizzle.
59583|1|One of the most depressing film's I've ever seen.
94133|0|... goes from barely tolerable to insufferable in the time it takes to unveil a stupid twist ending ...
75319|1|Grason Kanin's witty comedy in which Ginger Rogers plays a single mother was a commercial hit, demonstrating her viability as a dramatic actress and comedienne after her separation from dance partner Fred Astaire.
22317|1|Sheer stylish entertainment and a joy from start to finish.
83955|1|[A] cheering reminder of what can be done by clever people with a small budget and a lot of enthusiasm.
81977|0|Azumi may be an outstanding assassin, but the makers of this movie killed any chances of her being the next great action hero.
96735|0|...eventually you can't help but wonder if these poor folks are being tossed about by the capricious winds of fate -- or just jerked around by an ambitious young screenwriter.
2018|0|It's not a total bust, and some of the performances are charming, but it never matches the gleeful, irreverent mischief it had on stage.
63311|1|... a terrific piece of heist filmmaking made with a rough-and-tumble attitude and old-school professionalism.
81968|0|The notion that all these [lesbians] are physically and emotionally satisfied by their trysts with Jack would have played well at the recent Republican National Convention.
36044|1|The ending gets a little too cute, and isn't true to Anna's independent nature. Oh well, to forgive is divine.
71113|1|Definitely one of the best film noir movies I've seen so far.
32773|1|A decent enough thriller.
83860|1|Mervyn LeRoy's fact-based WWII action-drama was extremely popular due to subject matter, star power (Spencer Tracy), Oscar-winning effects, and intelligent script by Dalton Trumbo, later blacklisted and one of the Hollywood Ten.
21776|1|LaBute's films have much to say even if they can be overwhelming. Unlike action films you forget in an hour, his movies will stay with you for years afterwards, provoking thought and reflection.
94406|1|Here's a Cameron Crowe film that, oddly enough, wasn't directed by Cameron Crowe.
61564|0|The whole thing is loud and unfunny, not showing off anyone to good advantage.
4380|0|Be careful about taking kids under 7 or 8 as it may scare them.
47700|1|Habrá quien le rinda aplauso de pie, y habrá quien lo aborrezca y desee lo peor para el director, pero les prometo que no les dejará indiferentes...
81910|1|One of those necessary films that we have to see for our own health.
58597|1|A sprightly pace and a fatalistic sense of humor propel the proceedings over a generous amount of drinking jokes and other cliches of Irish life and culture.
34053|0|Talented cast wasted in an awful movie.
56639|0|It would be hard to imagine a more feeble rendering of the 19th century Grimm Brothers tale.
38208|1|The Eastwood team has pulled off a modest enjoyable winner.
84245|1|It's the kind of narrow-gauged drama that either will drive you crazy or absorb you in its low-key rhythms. Mostly, I went along for the ride.
66052|1|Babenco's film blends ideology with drama and betrayal for a tale as intellectually rewarding as it is passionate.
91939|1|A pretty darn good, but not completely great, war movie that pays overdue homage to the WWII veterans who never made it home.
65975|1|Never coherent and frequently pretentious, the film remains an audacious attempt to place obsessive personal images before a popular audience -- a kind of Kenneth Anger version of Star Wars.
27146|1|Best seen with wild crowd at midnight. Otherwise, nope.
30102|1|Everything that worked in DR. NO is fully realized here. Sean Connery is 10 times more confident here as 007, oozing charm and masculinity.
44674|1|Once again, Kisrten Dunst saves a film just with her presence.
64577|0|Will kids enjoy this? Well, does a child like candy?
15768|1|Tarsem's film is breathtakingly imaginative, but at times you're left feeling like you've eaten too many sweets.
52246|0|Murphy is no more capable of portraying an authentic cop than he is of going to the grocery store without a posse of Hollywood hangers-on.
5363|0|Every promising situation -- Shore suffering through basic training, dealing with real battle and so on -- suffers immediate creative fatigue.
3538|1|A bauble, perhaps, but smartly mounted and sweetly offered -- a Disney flick with brains.
6497|1|The movie is quite enjoyable as long as it explores the fantasy of a neglected little boy having an entire house of his own to explore and play in, and it still manages to be fun when he exhibits superhuman ingenuity and resourcefulness.
76660|1|Like all great works of art, the film has a purity of line and structure as it plays out its theme.
74789|1|A fine entertainment and proof that Billy Wilder had what it took from the very start of his career.
27215|1|One of countless pieces of '50s pulp to come out of a social fabric defined equally by interest in the unknown and mounting Cold War paranoia.
32356|1|Es la historia de un amor que rompe las barreras del tiempo y el espacio y que nos recuerda que lo más importante que puede tener una persona son sus emociones
12210|1|The director repeatedly places the viewer at the center of the crossfire and turns the gyrating camera into the next best thing to a lethal weapon.
57182|1|Let's face the music and dance, indeed.
8211|0|Chain Reaction isn't dull -- the film is paced to keep audiences attentive -- but the lack of originality dampens its enjoyability.
2688|1|[Featrues] a plethora of memorable scenes.

17729|1|Cinema.com: A densely erotic, twisted take on teen screen romance, Twilight zones out beneath the crushing weight of underage lust intensified and complicated by the excruciating abstention here of unorthodox vampire appetites.
92680|1|It is challenging but simultaneously exhilarating as we travel through this never-waking nightmare.
100565|1|Despite a known outcome, James Marsh's documentary offers sublime thrills - grafting the tense suspense of a heist film onto an existential dissection of artistic accomplishment and true friendship.
1283|0|The movie is full of battle scenes, all of them interchangeable.
17281|0|Does this work? Is it worth the trouble? Not really.
31114|1|The acting is the only reason to watch it.
84090|1|An allegory of the end of the studio system, couched in archaic-modern mementos
32519|1|"""Easy Rider,"" even for those uninterested in the legacy of 1960s counterculture, punches the viewer in the gut with its hopelessness and emptiness."
52110|0|An unintentional laff riot. Olivier is so over the top that it's mesmerizing.
26331|1|A technologically stunning movie that furthers the genre and features crowd-pleasing performances to go with the frequent scenes of gunplay and violence.
60871|1|Engaging romantic comedy.
100707|1|There is a deep morality at work here, as often in Schrader's work.
68990|0|Not as bad as legend says, but still pretty bad.
29143|1|Lots of fun, laughs and action!
19745|0|It may be one of the most famous, but it's certainly not an original on which others are based.
65985|1|It certainly sets the skin a-crawl, I'll give it that.
35766|1|Contrivances abound, no doubt, but the picture refuses any disingenuous pollutant access to the mix, instead leading with heartfelt, lived-in emotions, enjoying a deliciously homey mood of friendly flirtation and old-world wisdom.
22344|1|A technically compelling Hitchcock film which, while made early in his career and rather crude, displays his genius at creating visual suspense.
99994|1|It's surprising, enthralling, intriguing, blackly droll, and a rattling good yarn.
17182|0|An oppressively long cinematic oddball.
3230|0|I kept wondering: what would Jesus think about this movie, a kiddie pic that indicts America for losing sight of the one person that Christmas was always supposed to be about, and that's Santa.
8944|1|"The Paramount crew that worked on Roman Holiday reminded me of expert marksmen who had made ""charm"" their target and seldom if ever missed it."
84390|0|Dash can't decide whether he's making New Jack City or Friday.
72329|1|Ozu's delicate, wry comedy of manners takes a sympathetic but not uncritical look at life and etiquette in a small 1950s Japanese village community.
47755|0|A miserable ripoff of The Karate Kid.
1880|1|Sporadically intriguing but ultimately overrated...
50667|1|An innocent adventure that's technically slick and lacking in pretense, this film should provide a nice scare for kids, and maybe a few of the grown-ups too.
10805|1|Lemmon plays it dirty throughout and for huge effect. Curtis underplays for equally comic effect. Wood comes through on a par with the two male stars.
43756|1|9 to 5 works as a wish-fulfillment satire on male chauvinism.
99673|1|It's not much of a film, but it's a swell opinion column.
14179|1|Star Trek IV has all the elements people love about this series, and it earns its reputation as one of the long-running franchise's standout entries.
25982|0|This bleak chapter of the Apes saga strived to echo the sentiments of many of its fellow films released that year. Not easy to do in a cheap monkey mask.
61174|0|Turgid and self-indulgent...haphazardly constructed and featuring dialogue that sounds poorly improvised--as well as a central character who's less a human being than a collection of cliches.
66741|0|This is one of those rare films that truly manages to get by on unintentional laughs, but otherwise dreadful.
77922|0|Duff's sunny disposition makes her a likable movie presence, but I've yet to see anything from her...beyond a 'let's put on a show' high school drama club enthusiasm.
52730|1|"[VIDEO ESSAY] ""Slap Shot"" is a sports movie that revels in details of milieu, plot and character. Smokestacks billow white plumes from a perpetually overcast industrial skyline. Everything is old and weather beaten. Every victory is tainted."

81426|1|Gone is much of the bombast of the original...
102294|1|"Even if the results do not quite live up to [Wallce and Gromit's] best work, ""A Matter of Loaf and Death"" is nevertheless another fine mess, loaded with droll dialogue and amusing sight gags."
73992|0|This is patronizing, offensive garbage, bought to you by the director of The Karate Kid.
59115|1|Guttenberg ... obviously meant this as a major stretch, and does his best acting work since his breakthrough in Diner.
76894|1|The year's best action thriller with excellent performances from its two leads and Mann's brilliant direction making something as pedestrian as a taxi ride a pulse-pounding thrill ride.

59799|1|A playful, delightfully unfathomable piece of magic.
34358|1|Bull Durham is the feel-good movie of the Summer of '88. The sooner you see it, the happier your summer's going to be. So what are you waiting for?
84950|0|Wants to be tangy but comes off sour instead. It might just leave you with a bit of a headache, too.
51200|1|So the script's a little laboured, but for shere exuberance and adrenaline pumping you don't get better than this unless you're at a rave.
19010|0|Sappy and manipulative; it's further weighed down by an overloaded, over-politically-correct script.
77943|0|Oozes sentimentality for the plight of these mildly eccentric characters... The problem isn't the film's gooey center but the flavorless, formulaic substance surrounding it.
83719|1|Good Walter Matthau vehicle co-starring Bruce Dern.
24691|1|You've Got Mail is not as saccharine as I expected, but the sugar-coated love story offers us nothing new or original.
91665|1|This is the movie they should show in college acting classes, instead of tapes of Inside the Actors' Studio.
35529|0|In an otherwise boneheaded hour and a half of intrigue and silliness, The Skulls does offer one of the more memorable lines of dialogue in recent movies.
64269|0|...the ending does nothing to dispel the feeling that one has just wasted 117 minutes of one's life on empty gestures.
54277|1|"Another one of those estrogen overdose movies like ""Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood,"" except that the writing, acting and character development are a lot better."
99187|0|Passable but rather melodramatic hokum.
18573|1|Insomnia is not so much about the murder mystery as it is about Will's internal struggle with what's right and what's possibly okay.
41171|1|Overrated... but worth seeing.

30516|1|Goofy fun, but hardly a classic. James Bond, you ain't got nothin'!
85187|1|A vivid portrait of art rising from deprivation and social hopelessness.
81804|0|Bobby Jones deserves a better movie than this one.
86010|1|I wish the plot were pared down, that the magic used more sparingly. But new movies offer us so little, it seems daffy to complain that this one gives us too much.
16401|1|Perfectly affable, and there are some good laughs.
23923|0|People complain about shock cinema and how far it has to go now to penetrate our jaded, desensitized sensibilities. Come meet the grandfather of it all!
32647|1|A lusty story of friendship and rivalry in the ring and in affairs of the heart.
838|0|Film school grad Jason Bloom makes his directing debut, but his inexperience shows.
19913|0|Boy, this one's rich.
24984|1|There's a wholehearted commitment in every frame toward synthesizing the feeling of hopeless addiction. It's in the writing. It's in the chaotic cinematography. It's in the actors' eyes.
53069|0|Scenes that are meant to be scary end up generating laughs.
46645|1|Have a blast with the first story, fast-forward through the second and check out the last.
14058|0|...more intriguing than Denis' later efforts, but no less frustrating, and ultimately unrewarding...
3764|0|The performances are precise, the language is alive and well spoken and the setting is striking, but Vanya on 42nd Street still suffers rather heavily from the limitations of filmed theater.
16859|1|Harrison Ford renders one of his best dramatic performances, for which he won his sole Oscar nomination, in Peter Weir's beautifully shot feature, which is effective as a cop thriller as well as a chronicle of the rural Amish subculture.

57959|0|It looks great, has an excellent cast and is effectively creepy at first. But try as it does, it just winds up falling into the lame generic Hollywood homicide thriller mold.
83512|1|It's a movie that many people remember with affection and respect from their childhoods -- because it scared the crap out of them.
35374|1|A low-rent Psycho-like flick that's more creepy than scary.
12104|1|A fantasy that... goes right in spite of its solemn style.

49848|1|a wonderfully warm human drama that remains vividly in memory long after viewing
42607|1|Happy to distract the viewer with chase sequences and extended invasion showdowns, also using Danning's sex bomb appeal to keep attention away from the budgetary limitations. Why pay for explosions when there's spandex?
42400|0|Doyle should have spent more time on the story and less time in the video store searching for inspiration.
4965|0|Some movies get you so excited - so revved up on action and thrills -- that you almost feel like you're flying. Cliffhanger makes you feel like you're dropping.
66817|1|...an explosion of bad taste swallowed, and occasionally spit back out, over and over again, culminating in fashionable she/he cat fights by the pool.
83810|0|Excessively violent but oddly dull...a Crusades allegory for teeny-boppers
38361|1|A little bland, but it puts you in the mood to forgive it: relaxed and mellow and accepting.
35611|1|Midnight Express walks a fine line between portraying Hayes as a victim or a criminal.
79489|1|Pragmatic to the point of being almost mechanical, Pickpocket it is paradoxically saturated with soulfulness.

42798|0|"Sarah Jessica Parker's embarrassing contribution to that much-studied genre known as the ""'80s teen movie"""
100848|1|Wilson plays disillusionment convincingly, the supporting cast (especially Barraza) is golden, and director Mark Pellington has just the right touch to bring off a teary-eyed inspirational drama.
33478|1|Serves more as a fun guilty pleasure, but one that chooses to embrace the absurdity and run with it...
87037|0|Prime is as dead as any body at the morgue.
91518|0|"Mel Gibson follows up ""The Passion of the Christ,"" his entrée into directing schlock B-move horror films with high production values, with an even more gory study into bodily torture and death."
90294|1|It's too long, but then so-called 'event movies' always have been.
97748|1|It's hard to argue that the film is more than very competent.
58832|1|Wagner is perfect as the college kid psycho coolly removing the pregnant Woodward from his life.
38882|1|Beresford has drawn amazing performances from Ben Faulkner as the boy and ravishing ex-model Liv Tyler as his distraught sister.
62375|0|...a tepid remake at best and a dreary exercise in wastefulness at worst.
57157|1|If you've got a strong stomach, My Bloody Valentine 3D is a definite pleasure...albeit a guilty one, in the perversely stupid tradition of all good gore films.
37497|1|Provides an opportunity for us to look afresh at ourselves and to ponder what it means to be children of the Universe.
58807|1|Closer to the play than Wyler's first effort at the story, but oddly less compelling.
10605|0|...if you're not prepared to watch Richard Gere pulsate for 106 minutes, you're not going to have much fun with this picture.
57552|1|Works better in its various parts than as a whole.
20730|1|In a genre full of desperate characters scrambling and plotting to grab their slice of the American dream, Jacques Tourneur's Out of the Past (1947) is a hard-boiled tale of betrayal with an unusually haunting quality.
32468|1|Warchus seems as at ease with the complexity of the style as he is with directing actors.
15491|1|Everything in the film rings true, is deeply moving, richly photographed, and wonderfully acted.
53864|0|There are some truly great actresses in this movie, but nearly all of them are wasted playing caricatures.
77600|0|Not since Pia Zadora's The Lonely Lady has a gardening tool been so violated.
1494|0|It's not exactly a bad movie, but it's so forgettable that it's almost exhausting.
41991|1|There are scenes that will make even the most seasoned horror fan squirm - nothing can prepare you for when Cerina Vincent gets into the bathtub.
20439|1|Far more satisfying than his later works (one hesitates to call them mere movies).

66477|0|[Finney is] the only element of this production that is really up to much good... the film lacks energy or dramatic thrust.
84616|0|You've got the makings of one royally uninspired comedy and utterly generic Hollywood mess.
12645|1|Really head-twisting adaptation of the play with fine work from Oldman and Roth.
94586|0|Unfortunately, its superb performances and assured camerawork are overwhelmed by dubious psychology and a clichéd climax.
66708|1|It's a stately, handsome-looking studio drama that, for me, never really became emotionally or intellectually involving.
89366|1|The script's fusion of B-movie crime cliches and dystopian futurism, if not exactly original, is nonetheless vigorously engaging, and the English-language voice cast is good enough to make the existential noodling seem like real dialogue.
50734|0|It's official...Oscar-winning Cuba Gooding Jr.'s career has gone straight to the Dogs!
88196|1|A series of interesting ideas floating around a sea of blood
66661|1|Great acting, great script and competent directing fuel a truly good work of art not to be missed.
89013|1|Gavin Hood, adapting playwright Athol Fugard's 1980 novel, sweeps us out of our comfy seats and drops us into the stark realities of an impoverished world ruled by those most bold and ruthless.
27611|1|"Leos Carax's inspiration for this film was Jean Vigo's masterpiece ""L'Atalante"" (1934)."
56968|0|A modest bit of macho cinema.
55589|1|The film has a satisfying honesty to it and outstanding Ingmar Bergman-like performances from Lancaster, Kerr and Hackman.
82952|0|Don't let the trailer mislead you. Summer Storm is not some sort of supersexy European art film. It's kids being kids, and you've outgrown summer camp.
55821|1|Ultimately, The Four Feathers is nothing more than a handsomely mounted escapist action flick.
6905|0|The French idea of a 'family film' is a bit kinkier than what we're accustomed to.
8254|0|To the slim degree that it qualifies as a comedy, House Arrest is a comedy with rank amateur pathos, and it's totally out of touch with its own superficially treated emotions.

46517|1|The more ridiculous it becomes, the better looking it gets.
14073|1|For non-addicts, the smart plot and effects go some way towards compensating for the plastic characters and costumes.
98640|1|Quiet City is a slight film, but it's so pure and precise and honest that it takes on stature beyond its actual size. As a work of art, it makes a big noise indeed.
64668|1|The way Ozu builds up emotional empathy for a sense of disappointment in its various characters is where his mastery lies.
101759|1|They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but it can make for some awfully dull films. The line between inspiration and imitation is fine crossed repeatedly. Pride and Glory isn't the worst offender, just the latest.
45425|1|"Favreau and Vaughn retain the ad-libbed give-and-take that sparkled in ""Swingers."""
13037|1|...one of the staples of black comedy for stage and screen.
38077|0|The stream-of-consciousness structure effectively captures a mind lost in thought; what it doesn't effectively create, however, is drama.
53522|1|"One of those ""universal"" tales that are so often vague and sticky, but the simplicity and restraint of director Grigori Chukhrai lift it above the run."
57687|1|For all its oddities and deliberate controversy, Padre Amaro is at bottom a very melodramatic soap opera. It's not a bad one, but it's pretty much 99 and 44/100ths pure.

100542|0|It keeps assuring us that all is basically well.
64437|0|L'utilisation presque exagérée de la violence rehausse la qualité du film et l'ensemble est tellement mauvais qu'il en devient bon.
12076|1|Coppola delivered a harrowing masterwork that bursts with malarial, mystical images...
4346|0|It's often genuinely funny -- but it's still an establishment picture pretending it's not.
73099|0|Gained international acclaim for Anthony Quinn in a role many believe he was born to play and one that he's become best-remembered for.

81777|1|[It's] perhaps the most boring thriller you will ever see that will still manage to thrill you like crazy.
69523|0|"If ""House of Sand and Fog"" ultimately feels like a failed exercise, it has less to do with Perelman's limitations than with a book that would have been better served by staying on the page."
21003|1|It's bleak, creepy, and occasionally terrifying.
74716|0|It wants to be sexy, funny and incisive, but instead it is more overheated and silly.
26804|1|O roteiro de Stephen Sommers tem o bom-senso de não se levar a sério.
60981|0|Bother! Or, rather, why bother?
77139|0|The mood is spooky, the murk ominous.
9276|0|It was hard to get excited about such an overlong dreary tale, where Cooper was miscast and the champagne fizzles.
78076|1|Zany Beatles tale which has a lot of truth to it.
97727|0|There's an old saying: 'I wrote you a long letter because I didn't have time to write a short one.' In the case of Mad Money, I'll write a short review because the movie won't sustain a long one. (It barely sustains itself.)
90461|1|A poignant inside look into the world of crossover puzzles of the NY Times.

1240|0|Lame, unfunny stuff.
4078|1|Massively underrated.
24530|0|The outcome of the film is predetermined by the formulaic scripts of Rocky II and Rocky III. Stallone boxed himself into a corner with this one.
31652|1|A delightful confection that leaves you with a great big smile of contentment.
24094|1|Seen today, it's actually an astoundingly brave, weird movie that tries more and accomplishes more than many of today's bland roller coaster rides.
6298|1|Visually a macabre knockout, this 75-minute fantasy boasts some of the wittiest, most vigorous stop-motion animation effects in the history of the process.
8391|1|All this is executed with a good deal of panache, if not originality, by stunt coordinator Stanley Tong.
83516|1|This was a first-rate classic horror story, whose richness is enhanced because the shock scenes are understated and left mostly to one's imagination.
99255|0|A the point where the film starts exploiting the Holocaust to score cheap shots.. there's no laughter left, only pure, unbridled disgust.
6313|1|A fun adventure, but nothing new. Average retelling of the legend. Platt steals the show.
5361|0|It stars Pauly Shore...you do the math.
91356|1|It's kind of weird and very French, but don't let that scare you. The Science of Sleep is well worth your time.

13364|1|Odd, hypnotic, and frequently quite beautiful.
91804|0|Peyton Place with a perv!
86454|0|...there comes a point at which Into the Blue becomes just overwhelmingly silly...
26268|1|It is an unexpected blend of caper, buddy flick and romantic comedy, brought to life by a skilled cast who look for all the world like they are having themselves one heckuva a blast.
89803|1|There's a lot of heart and soul--complemented by some of the most eye-popping visuals the computer-animation pioneer has ever devised.

20420|0|Is Tolkin really that much better than an ersatz Larry Cohen?
53783|1|Munch's screenplay is tenderly observant of his characters. He watches them as they float within the seas of their personalities. His scenes are short and often unexpected.
16009|0|It manages to be uninteresting, slight and bleak, while desperately trying to find something to say about the human condition.
14796|1|Prefontaine gets to the finish line in reasonable shape despite plenty of sloppy running along the way.
45620|0|You know a movie is in trouble when the special effects forces at Industrial Light and Magic are employed to jazz up games of golf.
95284|0|It's an exercise in calculated high-quirk in which the most egregious forms of stereotyping -- particularly along gender and religious lines -- attempt to pass for 'human' behaviour.
44518|0|The most aggravating thing about Too Late the Hero is that Aldrich is a film maker of some accomplishment.

53063|1|As horror flicks go this is both smart and suspenseful.
62243|1|The theatrical antics are a bit forced and the musical numbers aren't the best in the history of musical cinema, but this still stands as an 'important' film of its era, albeit a minor and relatively forgettable one.
83152|0|While clumsily paced by first-time director Jim Yukich and amateurishly acted, the picture does take place against the imaginative backdrop of New Angeles, the urban archipelago formed when the Big One crumpled Southern California.
33078|0|Weak and often inappropriate romantic comedy.
92852|1|It's not a great movie, no, and maybe not even a particularly good one. But it's likable and unassuming, and the dancing is off the hook, or whatever the kids are saying these days.
79413|1|Jean Cocteau's updating of the Orpheus myth to post-Liberation Paris is one of cinema's great artistic masterpieces, a piece of Méliès-like magic that is intensely powerful and moving even at its most bewildering.

73131|0|The orgy of violence, as ghastly as in any video game, should go a long way toward erasing whatever goodwill Stallone earned with his sentimental Rocky Balboa.
28341|0|The filmmaker shows no talent at storytelling, leaving the movie to live or die on the basis of the characters it creates. And none of them, save Hank/Henrietta, are compelling.
46722|1|"The greatest distinction of ""Ghost World"" is its singular spirit. Here's a dark, deadpan comedy about alienated kids that manages to be smart, surpassingly odd, extremely funny and mysteriously endearing at the same time."
80558|1|Round Midnight is a superbly crafted music world drama in which Gallic director Bertrand Tavernier pays a moving dramatic tribute to the great black musicians who lived and performed in Paris in the late 1950s.
4619|0|"It's hard to understand why Martin Scorsese wanted to remake a nasty, formulaic 1962 thriller whose only ""classic"" credentials are a terrifying performance by Robert Mitchum and a Bernard Herrmann score."

97972|1|Taken together, the women tell a universal story about the beauty and battles of daily life.
96404|0|Blanchett is again director Shekhar Kapur's greatest asset. His weakness is his tendency to fall back on silly, melodramatic contrivance better suited to popcorn fare than to a believable meditation on Elizabethan England.
90956|0|Though keeping worthwhile targets - like professors who want to see their most creative students fail - director Steve Pink lets his punk inspiration slide into standard school rivalries and unrelated slapstick.

45101|1|Jonathan Demme's picaresque joyride across the American landscape is still arguably the best thing he's ever done.
93785|1|Pierre Salvadori's deceptively sunny romantic comedy insinuates its point of view steadily, amidst great glamour and breeziness, only to reveal itself as a meditation on, dare we say it, capitalism.

92332|1|Ayer has a feel for the grimy underside of urban life...
62711|1|The middle is heavy on romance between the two stars -- both megawatt powers in 1979 -- but the central plot, about a stolen horse for God's sake! -- doesn't carry the weight director Sydney Pollack might like us to believe.
26970|1|Christopher Reeve essays the title role and makes it his own, combining correctly chiseled features with a likable comic humanity, while the film itself nicely balances special effects with the romance of Superman and Lois Lane.

54879|1|A gripping and well-made thriller that preserves Shyamalan's winning streak and shows us, as all the best films do, a world that we're familiar with and believe in, and yet we've never seen, and by which we're endlessly fascinated.
99066|0|[Leto's] mumbled voiceover may perfectly reflect Chapman's inner world. [But] who wants to enter that world? Neither Chapman ... nor his inner life is very interesting ... I was looking at my watch before the first third of the movie had passed.

40354|1|"Has its flaws, but being a boring Bond movie isn't one of them. It may not hit top tier status, but Connery makes ""Diamonds Are Forever"" another gem in the 007 mythos."
62880|1|A classic 1934 documentary from Robert Flaherty, pioneering forefather of the genre (see 1922's Nanook Of The North).
11478|0|Too many times, a strange brand of humor appears and sours the proceedings.
14736|1|"There?s no better feet-on-the-seat execution for the home-invasion genre than this. ""The Strangers"" twists the knife with scenes lasting a beat longer than normal to maximize dread and sound design excavating a hole in your cortex and nestling there."
93264|0|Stereotype-based comedy from Eddie Murphy in a variety of fat suits is just not enough to make a decent film.
68667|1|John Ford's classic western is a landmark of the genre for so many reasons: mature, classically constructed and superbly directed, it made a star of John Wayne...
93999|1|Jindabyne is not about just one murder but about the death by a thousand cuts that happens in its aftermath.
28943|1|Bravo!
57993|1|The film has a joyful sort of grandeur that's basically dead in the modern cinema.
66122|0|The first half of the film is amusing, but when it turns to a distasteful subplot that has an evil veterinarian/scientist stealing pets for nasty experiments, it goes sour.
62006|1|The higher aspirations sometimes weigh the action down, creating a story that is interesting but not always engaging, lacking the exuberance that could have made it truly exciting.
46373|1|Late career Brando is so-so drama.

51349|0|Pleasant but forgettable sequel to Disney classic.
366|1|Nothing more than an excuse for violent ninja fighting with a huge body count and plenty of blood - real and CGI.
75260|1|Mervyn LeRoy's picture is more a melodrama than a crime-gangster due to star Robert Taylor and the studio behind it (MGM), but it's worth seeing for Van Heflin's Oscar performance as the cynical alcoholic given to philosophical observations.
44158|1|There is a heap of fine acting and some crackling good direction by John Sturges mostly in the early stages, during formation of the central septet.
35539|0|In the end, Hook isn't great or terrible, but it's both - a film that has some wonderful moments, and some really awful ones
3192|0|Gag.
62512|1|Loads up on colors, cars and characters to distract from what's missing under the creative hood, yet this spirited sequel is fun as it rarely takes itself too seriously.

87709|1|Could a more important, relevant and complimentary film to Munich have come out in 2005?
70951|0|Easily the most controversial film of the year, Gibson's fil is a visually bold, relentlessly violent epos that suffers from a shallow, undernourished narrative and no characterizations to speak of.
2136|0|If the Sundance Institute or the AFI ever offers a course advising directors of successful first films what to avoid the second time around, Mallrats could be at the heart of the curriculum.
22404|0|Biel is not completely miscast in this role of the Other in the drawing-room midst, but she exudes a thoroughly contemporary air that never jibes with the Twenties tenor of the English manor-born in the decade after the Great War.
74148|0|Since Dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer, it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche.
100841|0|There is something contrived about this story in which people with major problems find a resolution.
24219|1|Horrocks' gift for impersonation is remarkable. If her acting career ever stalls, she can take her singing act on the road. Her Garland impression alone would fill every gay bar in the world.
15128|0|If you can be satisfied with just the film's atmosphere, then you might feel adequately nourished.
21516|1|Bluth and his animators, bless them, chose to revive an endangered art form -- classically detailed animation. They drew their characters exquisitely and gave them individual personalities.
99168|1|The boys' video project is modern enough to stand in contrast to the brick and tweed of the locale, but rather than glossing over that uncomfortable fit, Jennings highlights it with a one-man Flock Of Seagulls.
33599|0|A limp movie-within-a-movie parody that closed the trilogy with a fizzle instead of the bang it deserved.
9903|1|It comes from Disney's thoroughly proved mother lode: movies for the kids that adults will stay to enjoy themselves.
85600|1|At times so personal that the act of watching the movie often feels like eavesdropping.
62618|0|For such a refined director as Hawks to end his career on a note like this, having made some of the finest films in the history of American cinema, is an atrocity not worth the silver used in the negative.
48640|1|Highly conventional stuff, but lovingly constructed to produce unremarkable but heart-warming entertainment.

54929|0|The problem with Nick Broomfield's documentaries is, well, Nick Broomfield.
36840|0|A bit slow, a bit been-done, and the bottom line is that Allen in a pair of shorts these days is a little rough on the eyes.

63981|0|Lying somewhere between Fame and Meatballs, Camp unfortunately possesses neither the energy of the former nor the hilarity of the latter.
38625|1|A biting satire of Japanese culture and its uneasy incorporation of Western influences.
61210|1|Though not one of Truffaut's strongest works, this loving tribute to the chaotic process of filmmaking is charming, which may explain its win of the best foreign language film Oscar.
54450|0|Crisply, starchily self-conscious in its efforts to be a gangster epic. A pretty-enough remote place, with its rain and snow and fedoras and trenchcoats, but it's still a long way from Boardwalk Empire and Miller's Crossing.
77342|1|He abandons even the semi-realism of 'Purple Rain' for something closer to a good, old-fashioned, backlot musical - something we get even less of these days, so enjoy the novelty.
77033|1|held together by the remarkably vivid and varied performances of Ruffalo, Dern, Watts and Krause, each of whom gets his or her share of juicy moments and sharp dialogue.
85851|0|The movie is never more than a hesitantly filmed recording of the play.
68787|1|Lange's performance as tragic country crooner Cline, whose life was brought to a premature end by an unfortunate meeting of her plane and a mountain, is the main reason to watch this lively biopic.
32028|0|A deeply and disappointingly conventional picture masquerading as a free-spirited one.
14954|0|Good actors elevate this disappointing and lame effort by a respected filmmaker.
18373|0|This silly adventure with Casper Van Dien as the latest Lord of the Apes comes across more like a sequel to George of the Jungle, but without the laughs.
84112|1|... a tribute to the magic of movies and moviemaking set and shot in Almeria, Spain (home to scores of sixties westerns).
82498|0|The smart-mouth-maverick-cop genre never looked more shopworn and played-out than in this halfhearted, half-baked mess.
28132|1|...we can forgive Spielberg his indulgences when the outcome is so profoundly moving.
29516|1|The set-up is so strong that it's impressive to see it progress so effortlessly.
34751|0|It's not especially well-written: It shifts uneasily between grotesque humor and pathos.
36939|1|Even with its (likely dictated) propaganda on behalf of the now-superfluous 1942 edition, this set restores a high watermark in cinematic comedy to nearly full glory.
91796|0|Bereft of a protagonist, the movie breaks down under the weight of absurd voice-over narration and an exploitative ending that is as indefensibly wrongheaded as it is cheap.
19362|1|Today, it works well as a child's introduction to Dickens.
21742|1|McNaughton's direction combines a strict social realism with a cool, Fritz Langian sense of pre-determination, while his work with actors has the improvisational freshness of a John Cassavetes.
40812|1|whimsical and lighthearted, a simple fable with no real message to impart except that Christianity without compassion can quickly dissolve into empty ritual.
24060|0|It's more cheerful than funny, and so insistently ungrudging about Americans and Japanese alike that its satire cuts like a wet sponge.
60521|0|Everyone's got demons to deal with -- from Gideon's guilt over a kid that played for him and died under mysterious circumstances to the audience's unwillingness to sit through two hours of yet another inspirational football movie.
59283|1|Review Imitation Of Life is another of those Douglas Sirk melodramas that no critic had a good word to say about at the time of their release but are now widely considered movie masterpieces.
51560|0|Boy, does the final reel stink.
9111|1|While the film offers no overt violence or thrills, it is a model of sustained mystery and eerie suspense.
55846|0|Un thriller manqué qui tombe sur les nerfs presque dès la première image.
11165|0|We have seen Martin Scorsese's gangster films, and Abel Ferrara, you are no Martin Scorsese.

52268|0|...overly melodramatic...
34326|1|This charming comedy shows sensitivity to American peculiarities and eccentricties in spite (or may be because) of the fact that it was scripted by a writer of foreign descent and helmed by a Brit, Peter Yates.
48664|0|Is it offensive? Yes and no. It's insensitive, certainly. And I wouldn't want my mother watching it, lest she think I've been in a sling in the meatpacking district for most of my adult life.
43648|1|When I see Woods on the screen in the first shot of a movie I sort of smile to myself because I know that something strange and offbeat and maybe even inspired is about to happen.
50580|1|Tsai's confidence in the deep power of silence drives home the film's inner convictions. Its surface works coolly, intriguingly and, happily, feebly in opposition to the heart of the matter.
48995|1|An exemplary Schrader work, a painfully funny and misanthropic treatise on American masculinity and its sexualised image.
39481|1|The cast makes it watchable, which is good because little else does.
19032|1|MGM at its glossiest and most melodramatic, with a an all-star cast that includes Garbo, John and Lionel Barrymore, Joan Crawford, and Lewis Stone--the kind of pictures they don't make anymore.
7819|1|Minor Bertolucci, but achingly gorgeous.
59872|0|Nifty creature design, and Michael Moriraty's fun, but the rest doesn't add up to much.
46016|0|Right off the assembly line.
7210|0|This film mistakes action for energy, ridiculous circumstances for comedy, and a mismatched male/female pairing for romance.
42059|0|Es una pena que ya no existan cómicos que recurran al verdadero ingenio para lograr lo que cada vez es más difícil, que es hacer reír al público
76211|1|One of the few successful Spielberg clones, administering the usual routine of aliens and mouth-agape wonder with friendly determination and a perfect, just perfect, game boy screenwriting hook.
14822|0|Tom Arnold is no Ernest Borgnine. A profound statement.
78311|1|A clever, taut thriller that will have everyone guessing right up to its avant-garde conclusion.
82846|1|a watershed film that discusses an important societal development
67983|1|Slightly heavy-handed, but mostly effective.
39697|1|Fascinating still, but suffers from lack of more sophisticated special effects. Still...imagine Raquel Welch moving around inside.
94424|0|Bean and Carson are less different than they are the same, both self-centered and naïve, sad and lonely. Worse, Bean's movie isn't even as funny as Carson's.
27766|0|The whole movie's a giant croc.
49227|0|Morgan and Wong lose sight of what makes Li such an appealing star in the first place: his natural athletic ability.
64726|0|Contains many haunting moments and some striking shards of dialogue, but overall it's an uneven, often pretentious effort.
87098|0|I was intrigued by the intensity and audaciousness of Dogville, but Manderlay feels stagey, earnest, long and pretentious. Its grainy, shaky hand-held camera-work only adds to the monotony.
94836|0|88 Minutes is the sort of overblown thriller in which every action, no matter how insignificant, is pregnant with portent, yet it's a film of nothing but red herrings.
31794|0|A crowd-pleasing sensationalist jejune romantic thriller.
14831|0|Suitable only for movie-goers who have undergone frontal lobotomies.
59990|1|Compelling oddball thriller about a racist dog who only attacks blacks is directed by the always interesting Sam Fuller.
57712|1|Writer-director Burger imaginatively fans the embers of a dormant national grief and curiosity that has calcified into chronic cynicism and fear.
25200|0|A hoot to see Matt and Renee, but none of the thrills of the original. Not scary or fun.
50570|0|Hill and his stars are merely going through the motions, but the motions are immensely familiar.
8984|1|Running to nearly four hours and boasting at least three directors, this epic American Civil War romantic drama is more of a symbol of the Hollywood studio system than a mere movie.
99992|0|Is it supposed to be funny, tragic or what? Even the characters don't seem too sure.
86679|0|It's hard to believe chick flick tripe like this was even revered with critical praise, but it happened.
56005|0|Apesar de Jackie Chan ser sempre simpático, não há uma única coreografia de luta interessante ao longo de todo o filme, o que é decepcionante. Além disso, Hewitt está insuportável.
52875|1|It is a romantic comedy in the best classic Hollywood style, albeit one with some sharp writing and genuinely human as well as funny moments.
9729|1|From start to finish, Maximum Risk presents spectacular stunts choreographed and coordinated by Charles Picerni and some hair-raising, stomach-churning automotive chases attributed to Remy Julienne, the French master of the art.
24281|1|There are some nice moments early on.
49866|1|Channing gives a marvelously chilling performance.
82860|1|Cronenberg shows his stuff as an inventive auteur.
11203|1|Perhaps overshadowed by Anderson's other more ostensibly serious work, Punch-Drunk Love nevertheless represents both a highlight for the director and for its star.
40931|1|Thoughtful and gripping without wallowing in dramatics, it marks another high point in Sam Raimi's strange, but increasingly accomplished film career.
30262|1|...tries to deal with the messy process of nurturing a proper adult relationship rather than simply shoehorning two lovers into a predictable set of catastrophic circumstances until they finally succumb to one another.
11122|0|The end notes of Loser are lame, and it is not encouraging when a college movie means 'aid,' but spells it 'aide.'
62461|0|If giggling hillbillies fuel your nightmares, then there's a chance you'll be rendered sleepless by this inept, wannabe horror flick.
54824|1|Many directors still have never created one film equal to Red Beard, which only pales when compared to Kurosawa's greatest films
71314|1|If you have any interest in Raymond Johnson and his pop art, maybe you, too, will learn How to Draw a Bunny.
98751|1|This film's playful visual language pulls you in rather than shuts you out; it isn't difficult to decipher, and it enables Coppola and his editor, Walter Murch, to navigate the story's many realms with a directness and dexterity that are refreshing.
61466|0|You could have replaced everyone in this movie with the cast of some lily-white show like Dawson's Creek and nobody would notice the difference.
44601|0|The kind of film that children may find amusing but their parents will wish that they didn't.
92714|0|Mucho brillo y color y poca sustancia dramática en esta tragedia épica que emula tanto a Shakespeare como a Kurosawa. Vale la pena sólo por su aspecto visual y, sobre todo, por la siempre intensa Gong Li.
40320|1|I enjoy kissing women, and I'd be happy to do it again.
12042|1|A fine, moving, informative period piece for all ages, To Kill a Mockingbird is as much an abiding favourite as the book.
55439|1|As remakes go, Last House On The Left is at least a decent addition to the 1972 classic.
82469|0|This is one big missed opportunity.
46005|1|Schwarzenegger, who when he dons a green suit is dubbed 'Gumby' by Belushi, is right on target with his characterization of the iron-willed soldier, and Belushi proves a quicksilver foil.
12272|1|One of the most ambitious and brilliantly executed American films, a landmark work from one of Hollywood's top cinema eras.
2223|1|Chris Walken is worth the price of admission
22726|1|...a no-frills but convincing execution of the end of the world.
72870|1|One of the better Chuck Norris action flicks
1326|1|Chan's U.S. breakthrough may not be his best, but it's up there.
89521|0|"Silent Hill is like an endurance test to get to the ""'truth', but it's ultimately a gyp because it still doesn't make sense when you get there."
563|1|An eloquent and moving screen interpretation of Alan Paton's classic 1948 novel set in South Africa and dealing with the transforming power of forgiveness.
65673|1|May be the most damning movie ever made about psychiatry.
66814|0|As usual, Chabrol manages to get us worked up over these people, but any further investment is hard to justify.
20584|1|The early CG FX have aged remarkably well, while the slow build-up makes the Spielbergian space adventure all the more fantastic.
78106|0|What Arcand has devised is a kind of Nia Vardalos movie in tenured-faculty clothing: Our Big Fat Bourgeois Salon ... It trades only the crudest ironies and screenwriting mechanics.
38294|1|It's a testimony to how well Croupier works for 90% of its running time that the train wreck of a conclusion can't derail the whole film.
78946|1|Paul Wegener directs and stars in an enduring example of German Expressionist horror, based on an ancient Jewish myth.

32712|1|Triumphs on nearly every level.
68703|1|Some accomplished slapstick, but nothing special.
56039|1|I appreciate what the film has to say about honesty and moving on with life. But ... the film's ultimate 'insights' about going on with life seem hollow and insufficient.
69635|0|Inexpressibly ropey sci-fi thriller joylessly directed by John Woo and based, natch, on a Philip K Dick short story.
45677|1|Silly, curse-happy '80s Eddie Murphy vehicle.
73583|1|A wacky, darkly comic, and obscenely weird horror movie...
100293|0|Better than average but not worth phoning home about.
8622|1|French helmer Andre Techine's most personal--and arguably best--film is one of the few foreign language pictures that was recognized by most critics groups in the U.S.
44009|1|High above the tree line, Tinle, Karma and Norbu act out a universal human drama with only two special effects -- a blinking star and a yak.
65958|1|To Be and to Have is a movie every teacher should see, and every parent, too.
74764|0|An innocuous family feature that's too little/too late in the fast-moving world of feature animation.
19197|1|More realistic than sentimentalized Hollywood crowd-pleasers like Harvey, and more accessible than complete downers like Leaving Las Vegas, The Lost Weekend is, to me, the definitive film on the subject of alcoholism.
16311|1|Gimmicky but smart horror film.
55444|0|Unlike the Craven film, there's little of the audience implication that made these visions of violated innocence and draining retribution so troubling.
19753|1|Not as good as the original, but still pretty fun, it serves up more of the same and continued to be fresh enough before its many other sequels got too silly.
100896|0|An arresting concept, yet the resulting film is skimpy, numbing, and less searching than it believes it is
28787|1|In Too Deep offers a valuable perspective on violence and on the human tendency to suppress it or to relish it.
42637|1|Manages to find humor not just in the mundane existence of a small town but also in the overblown nature of action films. And, it works as an action movie on its own.
57537|1|The boating scenes have a languid yet charged sexuality, and the performances remain vibrant and rock-solid to the end.
18726|1|You probably haven't heard a lot about writer-director Noah Baumbach yet. Trust me, you will.
95581|0|Bratz (freaky looking teen dolls for girls whose parents won't let them play with real teenagers) is now a high school movie made for people in Grade 6.
1244|1|There was a time when Adam Sandler was genuinely funny. Oh, how we miss those times.
4308|1|"What a wonderful, detailed portrait. And what an evocation of a time and a mood. ""Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle'' is truly one of those films that inhabits its own world."
87407|1|There are moments of interesting honesty, and the players get to enjoy some meaty roles - especially Quaid, nicely underplaying one of the least showiest roles he's had in years.
102506|0|Who knew that F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story would end up on the screen as a three-hour Botox ad?
66671|1|It might almost be a subgenre: the Accidental Family film. It's enjoyable and a welcome break from the studio pictures, but it's familiar to you even as you're watching it.

49809|0|Behind Enemy Lines crosses into the ugly side of patriotism.
61746|0|Flat, uninspired and even tasteless.
98997|0|Every aspect of the production is atrocious in the extreme.The writing is awful. The direction is bilious.
57945|0|Ben Gazzara had some of Bukowski's outward mannerisms and the same beady eyes as the poet.
63829|1|Its sense of fun is infectious enough that it doesn't make a huge difference that it's light on the story side. Coupled with the visual style and the top-notch choice of music, it makes for a fun, if lightweight, experience.
3997|0|The uneven flow is as likely to lead to a snoozing viewer as to one on the edge of their seat.
78610|1|'Como obra cinematográfica, no es la pésima cinta que han destrozado. Es la simple interpretación de un talentoso cineasta sobre la vida de una leyenda de la humanidad'

27529|1|It may be silly, but it's never stupid.
8128|1|A Very Brady Sequel isn't great, but it's enjoyable.
17277|0|In the latest James Bond, our hero saves the world from brand-name unawareness. Tomorrow Never Dies is a dramatized trade show; imagine Comdex or the Geneva Automobile Salon with a plot.
102164|1|For the most part, the fights and chases are as implausible as the story, but there's an extraordinarily clever escape-from-certain-death bit about 20 minutes from the end that I don't think I've ever seen before.
62209|0|Breakdancing was a man-made scourge, and Breakin' is the price we had to pay for our arrogance.
11722|1|Best to savor The Grifters for its handsome design -- the picture looks as clean as a Hockney landscape -- and its juicy performances.
91829|1|Certainly doesn't want for sensationalistic subject matter, but the real impact comes from the methodical, steady compilation of evidence ... a queasy must-see.
88391|1|A sweet, heartbreaking, road trip film...
7829|0|Strike three, you're out. A stinker that should have been postponed because of inept filmmaking.
70179|0|This is neither the best nor the worst of this sort of thing -- nor even the most salacious. It may, however, be the silliest.
86342|0|It never really takes off as a fully developed chiller, rather settling for familiar characters and cloudy motivations.
13876|1|Goldsmith's score took the film to a level horror films generally never attained in the 1970s.
46794|1|Pleasant, mildly uplifting entertainment.
63149|0|You always get the feeling here that Roberts never actually knows where he's going with it.
67303|1|Elf is a Christmas comedy that's as sweet-natured and goofily amusing as its title character.
17683|1|The character is written as the most unlikable person one could ever meet. Despite this fact, Jack manages to make the character sympathetic.
29817|1|Part ghost story, part revenge Western, more than a little silly, and often quite entertaining in a way that may make you wonder if you have lost your good sense.
78657|1|Hardly a director alive possesses Godard's eye for dynamic, inner-lit old-masterly compositions.
25358|0|...may very well suffer from mismatched sensibilities.
48662|0|The film comes off as little more than a sensationalized exploitation flick.
98211|0|From this kind of witlessness, the only protection is not to see it.
27625|1|If Assayas doesn't always transport his film's events beyond the all too commonplace, his understatement can also yield moments of quiet simplicity.
39322|1|A wonderful film and one that shows just how much growing up US cinema has left to do.
59935|1|It's far better than any of the horror remake crap coming out and it earns its laughs honestly by actually intending to be funny.
25707|0|What could be funnier than Nick Nolte in a dress?
53981|1|It certainly feels unique, and sets itself apart from most American gangster films in its stark refusal to paint the lead gangster as likable or indeed anything other than the vicious socio-psychopath he is.
91722|0|To recreate the gossipy Manhattan arena that Capote navigated with such ease and documented with such malice, you need dialogue that rings like scatter-shot and the film's script, written by its director Douglas McGrath, doesn't have it.
91046|1|This is a movie for kids in the 8-12 range who see it as something that reflects their own lives. You may not care about How to Eat Fried Worms, but your kids will.
83857|1|After an overly mushy first half, the movie redeems itself with a second act that is decidedly dark and dreary and an extended air combat sequence that's still amazing nearly 70 years later.
39017|0|At least the ending doesn't cop out. There is no big happy ending where everyone gets a pro football gig or a big Nike ad campaign.
7255|1|Forget the mystery thriller plot... succeeds more as a study of character.

30359|1|Still pretty effective film version of the stage shocker.
86624|0|A predictable mishmash of sports underdog cliches with a domestic release timed to capitalize on anticipation for the World Cup. Accordingly, expect plenty of elbow room at the local multiplex.

18912|1|A disarming, charming fable so artfully crafted that adults will fall under its spell.
93828|1|Pushed the culture-shock of kitchen-sink drama further with its female protagonist and depictions and discussions of interracial coupling, teen pregnancy, the possibility of abortion, and homosexuality. [Criterion Blu-ray]
77406|0|Feels like a school project that has its heart in the right place if not the skills to produce something with depth and emotional heft.
77217|0|If the movie weren't done in such deadly earnest, it might have made a great cult-classic, 'so-bad-it's-good' flick, but as it is, it's simply bad.
53751|1|It's a tired premise, and it's got its flaws, but the present talent makes it worthwhile.

30504|1|Caine skillfully resists any temptation he may have had to pep up the proceedings. In fact, his consistent underplaying adds considerably to the pull of the picture.
64373|1|Creepy and memorable with a great death-by-hammer scene.
100734|1|Morton is one of those tingly actresses whose skin barely covers her soul, and to watch her search for tender mercies in a crazy-hostile world is a gift. The film is appallingly good.
8232|0|Stunningly awful.
48588|0|Confusing, badly written, poorly acted horror film that trots out a few clichés and eventually throws some semi-decent effects at them, in the mistaken belief that the audience won't be bored to tears.

90269|0|Implausible - with every urban cliche and stereotype - a complete waste of time and money.

76797|0|The filmmakers, clearly never having seen the original TV series, sideline the spacecraft and reduce this debacle to what essentially amounts to boys 'n' The Hood.
59496|1|Just the fact that it manages to keep the viewer involved despite the plot's general ridiculousness makes it the most effective Vancouver-shot horror flick in years.

102030|1|An appealing film for dog lovers and those seeking escapist entertainment.
55271|1|Although it is more of a comedy of manners than a well-developed story, there are enough yocks and bright moments to make it a thoroughly enjoyable outing.
12163|1|More than anything, Army of Darkness is a tribute to the Ray Harryhausen adventure epics (Clash of the Titans, Sinbad, and the like) that Sam Raimi grew up loving.
83088|0|refuses to go beyond shallow observations and silly slapstick, making for an ordinary outing when that should not be the case
69411|1|The film's core is all heart, but surrounding the dramatic moments is a pure sense of humor that generated more genuine laughter than any comedy I've seen in recent years.
32192|0|Intriguing but finally dissatisfying.
85231|1|A strong effort from everyone involved, though they're not all wholly successful.
54427|1|There is no substitute for on-screen chemistry, and when Friel pulls the strings that make Williams sink into melancholia, the reaction in Williams is as visceral as a gut punch.
17504|1|A crafty piece of work, ending with a pair of marvelous twists.
24367|0|Pale Rider does nothing to disprove the wisdom that this genre is best left to the revival houses. A double feature of Shane and Eastwood's High Plains Drifter will do just fine, thanks.

48781|0|Though 'Spriggan' manages to be both ludicrously convoluted and peculiarly childish, its worst fault is that it's mind-numbingly violent.

75711|1|Elegante e esteticamente admirável, este musical é um pouco mais longo do que deveria, mas as belas canções e os complexos planos concebidos por Winker acabam compensando.
67175|1|The epitome of neo-noir stylishness.
56534|1|This is, not to put too fine a point on it, a swashbuckler, a costume drama. If you love that old story form, you will be in old-fogy heaven, as it is nearly a perfect example of a genre that died out years ago.
98444|0|Most jokes are centred around either genitalia or that Austin Powers-style of wink-nudge faux sexuality, which doesn't work at all with this character.

27023|0|Wheezy and cheap
99253|0|Saffron Burrows is a stand-out as a provocative actress (and very possibly her mischievous lookalike), but it's not enough to make the muddled plot engaging, or fit for comparison with Klimt's stunning work.

17878|1|A really good example of character development by actions, without the benefit of dialog or mannerisms.

22286|1|It could have come across as strictly a work-for-hire gig, but it displays enough Hitchcockery to show he wasn't as disengaged from the material as he would later claim he was.
70487|0|Apart from a few serious leaps in logic, the story moves along swiftly and painlessly, and is not needlessly cute or stupid. But that's not much of a recommendation.
43472|0|Disappointing, too violent, and not very funny.
79405|1|Pretentious? Certainly, but full of the joy of filmmaking and there is a fairly coherent light through all the madness. It may illuminate man's obsessions and idol worship in a cautionary way, but Cocteau is also embracing those very ideas with his film.

9309|1|One of the best swashbucklers ever.
88022|0|Frears' skimpy plot is only a false front for the nudity, which includes a peek at Hoskins' naughty bits. Dame Judi, to her everlasting credit, keeps her clothes on.

54292|0|The first film had maybe a shred of realism to flavor its romantic comedy. This one looks like it was chucked up by an automatic screenwriting machine.

59233|1|So polished and assured it casts the supremely difficult illusion of being easy to make.
34806|1|Animal House is a self-congratulatory mess; but it's also spattered with terrific one-liners and sight gags, and it's the best showcase extant for John Belushi's subversive, attention-grabbing screen presence.

62570|1|The movie is smart with its storytelling and delivers several powerful scenes.

33216|1|Dreyfuss is great but the movie has not held up well.
64894|1|This is more than just a scathing satire on the political, religious and military representatives of the ruling elite. Ever the surrealist, Buñuel is also paying tribute to the poise and resilience of the very people he spent his whole career attacking.

80878|1|At once realistic and idealised, this is a rare attempt to make drama of ordinary people doing the right thing.

45292|1|Italian prog rockers Goblin's tingling, rasping, throbbing score [and] Argento's constantly gliding camera creates an almost unbearable sense of unease and suspense.
96890|1|The movie's title comes from the Irish toast, 'May you be in Heaven half an hour before the Devil knows you're dead.' Unfortunately, everyone in the film is running about 35 minutes late.
88438|1|What Winterbottom has done beautifully is distill Sterne's comic experimentation with the rules and shape of the written narrative and translate it into a lark on filmmaking form and technique.
80139|1|Theater of Blood reprises the multiple-revenge theme of the Phibes films, but injects new life into the concept with a superior script and stellar cast.
87146|1|Revolver taps into a struggle everyone faces that only a small few have been able to relate to. It's not that this film isn't a mess, but that mountain of a mess is on top of a shiny gem of a film that is worthy of being admired.
62904|1|A great villain performance by Jean Yanne.
41253|1|Not even the combined talents of Debra Winger and an Oscar-winning Louis Gossett Jr can turn this one into a great movie, but if you're in the mood for a wallow, it's perfect.
45159|1|the hushed, interior tone fails to generate much drama, and the tension never explodes
67595|0|Timeline takes the most ridiculous movie plot ever and multiplies it by ten.
1687|1|Good movie, great sword fights
10955|0|For a while, the obviousness and flat-out vulgarity are sort of entertaining, and it might be possible to enjoy the movie as a camp classic if you could ignore the mean-spiritedness that keeps breaking through.
52218|0|A thoroughly mediocre entry in the world of computer animation that does nothing to push the envelope technologically or creatively.
27773|1|A passable yet unspectacular horror effort...
85642|1|Jim Jarmusch vuelve a sorprender con una película minimalista donde los pequeños detalles, varios personajes episódicos, y un casi imperturbable Bill Murray, nos conducen hacia una travesía extraña y sugestiva.
2302|0|Yet another 'men are evil' film from Thelma & Louise writer Callie Khouri.
8731|1|This story of a party girl in love with a gigolo allows [director Blake] Edwards to create a very handsome film, with impeccable Technicolor photography by Franz Planer.
34243|1|Classic translation of the play that would have been even better with Paul Douglas.
4623|0|In Scorsese's frightfully wrong remake, De Niro seduces a teen (Juliette Lewis), bites off breasts with geek-like fury and breaks the world's record for longest hitchhike on the underside of a car.
44766|1|With its crackling dialogue and attractive, fully rounded characters, Russian Dolls puts American movies on similar subjects to shame.
99134|1|Borat/Bruno meets Michael Moore in this funny and thought provoking attack on religion.
95654|1|Partnering its ursine heroine's progress with that of a female walrus calf, Adam Ravetch and Sarah Robertson's documentary combines stunning wildlife footage with an environmental message.
31150|1|The remarkable thing about A Face in the Crowd is the way in which this 50-year-old film only seems to become only more relevant with the passing of time.
71171|0|...another Hollywood fabrication about how people act and feel.... substituting theatrics for genuine emotion.
50351|1|Um filme emocionante até os minutos finais, quando se entrega lamentavelmente ao romance barato.
54629|1|Thank God for Fat Bastard.
92474|0|It's a film about exploitation that sometimes feels like it IS exploitation and is only going to leave you frustrated.
79080|1|The film has a weird kind of poetry and beauty about it that is hard -- perhaps impossible -- to describe.
63179|0|The script is definitely mediocrity mixed with complication.
41927|0|The movie plays like it was written with a power tool.
19815|0|A definite improvement over the fourth and fifth installments...
39442|0|And the director's Oscar-winning daughter? Never did I ever think she could ever be so annoying.
14567|0|Isn't very exciting or involving.
64848|1|For now, though it's a mixed blessing, this seems like the movie Martin deserves.
96639|0|Austen wrote six novels and The Jane Austen Book Club is about six people who meet to discuss them over the course of six months. 666. Coincidence? I think not.
24745|1|Perhaps the movie's final, lasting image embraces all we know: From the mud grows the lotus.
49013|1|Despite this shortcoming, Intimacy takes us places very few films have, and the central performances are excellent.
86518|1|A dry yet whimsical touch, specifically British and also aware of cinematic tradition
66615|1|It's great fun. It's like one of those inspirational sports movies where you want to stand up and cheer at the end.
73467|1|A staple of Kung Fu television.
81663|1|If ever there was a film that deserved to get the proverbial bump from Oscar, this is it. Rarely has any film so focused on death felt so vibrantly alive.
63097|0|Watching them lock lips feels like incest propaganda: Justin and Kelly are offspring of the same publicity machinery, after all
60668|1|Não funciona como filme de terror (sua intenção original), mas torna-se interessante graças à curiosa atuação de Glover e à fotografia sombria. E Ermey é sempre fascinante.
66097|1|A heartwarming feast for adults. May bore kids.
96952|0|The film's points are made obvious the first minute and then monotonously drilled ad nauseum the remaining 87.
96764|1|The paintings become colourfully self-deluded distortions of a world where adults project themselves back into childhood, capitalizing on both the adult nostalgia for innocence and our fascination with children who seem somehow adult.
5254|0|Trash with a whiplash.
95392|0|The players appear to be having a good time, though the situation is too sitcom-familiar to be funny.
49222|0|A sci-fi kung-fu mish-mash of dreck . . . The use of stand-ins is obvious and the resolution is ludicrous.
30868|1|The movie is by far the best thing that Pollack has ever directed (with the possible exception of The Scalphunters).
99472|0|Either too cartoonish, or not cartoonish enough.
49216|1|It does well, but not brilliantly: an amusing trifle from a studio whose best work still lay ahead of it.
16898|1|Lumet moves with confidence between satire and intriguing, heightened-reality spirituality.
79536|1|This is a powerful and interesting picture that Kurosawa has made -- a bit tedious and mawkish in the last reels, but exciting enough along the way to satisfy audiences that know the subject.
95697|0|There's not a single moment that you haven't already seen in a different, better period film.
84706|1|Es un ejemplo claro de que la animación todavía tiene mucho que ofrecer, aunque sea de manera sencilla.
18580|0|Christopher Nolan's Insomnia adds 11 minutes to the Norwegian movie of the same name and manages to make everything that was fleeting and tantalizing in the original weighty, literal and dull.
57855|1|Treating this 19th century novel with tender loving care and just the right emphasis, director Claude Chabrol has made it speak to our times.
48268|1|It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World remains a technological and creative marvel for reasons beyond its sometimes fitful ability to make audiences laugh.
47738|1|It would be disingenuous to call Reno a great film, but you can say that about most of the flicks moving in and out of the multiplex. This is a movie that is what it is: a pleasant distraction, a Friday night diversion, an excuse to eat popcorn.
73055|1|The Best of Youth is no masterpiece, but it has enough truthful, moving moments to make it worthwhile.
25475|1|A solid enough action comedy, albeit one that had a lot of potential to be wittier and darker.
84753|1|By the end we're glowing with pride just like their parents and teachers.
12967|1|While Murray's deadpan putdowns and dry dismissals of provincial peccadilloes are the comic highlights, Groundhog Day is no supercilious rip of small-town U.S.A.
86865|1|The stories unfold at about the speed of a turtle slowing crawling across the sand, but eventually you get the whole picture and it becomes a moving story of love and redemption.
40664|1|John Hughes at the peak of his powers, with two masterful comedians at theirs.
19191|1|Today it's less impressive but not without its virtues.
20094|0|The franchise is back to its middling ways with Lethal Weapon 3, a sporadically entertaining entry.
91906|1|Um raro exemplo de produção norte-americana que encara o sexo com maturidade, o filme é um estudo de personagens com sucesso apenas moderado, já que não consegue desenvolver todas as subtramas com o mesmo cuidado ou interesse.
95624|1|Canet stages some breakneck chases, particularly one where Alex crosses a busy freeway, and corrals an array of fascinating characters to populate this twisty but entirely logical plot.
100984|0|Alexandre Aja must have thought that just because he's basing a film around mirrors acting irrationally, he can proceed to remove logic from all aspects of the film.
84051|1|The first part of the film, the best, is unmistakably Hawks.
97870|0|Players like Hill, Long, and Zahn have natural comedic ability, but there's honestly not much they can do with such weak material.
23982|0|Peter Jackson's remake of the 1933 classic is a loving homage that recreates and updates many of the familiar sequences... Unfortunately, the recreation leaves one wondering what, exactly, the point of the film is, other than indulging the director...
47611|1|A boxed-in [but] entertaining diversion... a small-scale surrealist love story anchored by two fully committed, highly watchable actors.
88572|1|The welcome absence of strained cleverness qualifies as one of its biggest virtues.
98494|0|With only a DNA witch's curse pig's snout compromising Ricci's otherwise exceedingly alluring physical assets, it doesn't make a lick of sense that prospective suitors are jumping out of windows after catching a glimpse of her disfigured beak.
97909|1|The film's exuberance, and the sense that it's all one big gimmick-packed action toy, give Hellboy II: The Golden Army a refreshing cinematic purity.
99468|1|Sophisticated political satire, ridiculous farce, black humour, spoof, intellectual game playing and comic invention
74159|1|The movie should be credited with remembering his victims.
38546|1|Appealingly silly romp for kids and adults.
7940|0|Though the explosion that seals off New York and New Jersey will have even curious theater concession stand crews bolting their posts, the characterizations are strictly low-cal.
33942|1|Interessante versão da história de Barba-Azul, desta vez com um Carradine atipicamente contido e, conseqüentemente, muito eficaz.
53530|1|Perfectly crafted.
75345|1|Raoul Walsh's heroes had a knack for going too far, but none went further than James Cagney in this roaring 1949 gangster piece.
12700|1|Falters when it goes for too much heart-tugging manipulation.
58627|0|A clever high-concept in search of a better movie.
25030|0|A stunningly inept and totally reprehensible film.
15250|1|In her 23rd film, Garbo's luminous performance, as the audlterous protag of Tolstoy's novel, is way above the mediocre level of the narrative and direction; the film is a remake of Love, in which Garbo starred opposite her then lover John Gilbert.
77115|0|This is a film that manages to take what should have been delirious camp fun and turn it into a struggle to keep any remote interest.
5667|1|Without that yeoman cast effort and Dillon's easy charm, Mr. Wonderful could easily be mistaken for Mr. Potatohead.
91462|1|The gluttonous middle section of the film is by far its most successful.
21762|1|If you can stand to watch Your Friends & Neighbors, you won't forget it.
39712|1|A masterpiece filled with raucous laughs, great spooks, and a wicked final scene.
97302|1|A return to form for the sci-fi comedy, with perhaps a bit more confidence. The story is a brilliant time travel adventure, that makes way more sense than, say, Southland Tales, and rewards longtime fans.
93718|0|The Ultimate Gift is kind of like a feel-good Saw for churchgoers, minus the sadistic games of death.
90974|1|Dark, dazzling turns by Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti, and Jessica Biel makes it achingly romantic.
33794|1|As charming as it is important, Not One Less has all the elements of a great drama: inspiring performances, the ability to make one laugh and cry and a subject matter worthy of further contemplation.
100627|0|It's a sentiment Capra might well have echoed, though he would surely have punched up the gags while he was at it.
100309|1|Despite the confused tone and underwhelming romance, this pretty little picture entertains in the main thanks to the intriguing subject matter and top turns from Zeta-Jones and Ronan.
16796|1|It's an extraordinarily affecting, personal, and at times uplifting tale.
39009|1|Here we have a bittersweet little character study masquerading as a caper flick.
46556|0|The latter half of the film is one long feeding frenzy, guided by a familiar horror-film principle: survival of the best-looking.
99816|0|More than anything, what bothers me about it is a sense of cheapness that ... centrally comes from a concept mainly built for shock value.
40332|1|Chadha juggles her characters so deftly that we never get tired of any of them and eagerly look forward to returning to each table as her camera jumps around.
12267|1|It is even better than the first film, and has the greatest single final scene in Hollywood history, a real coup de cinéma.
75932|1|This is down and dirty and raw.
75099|0|Hopelessly boring.
86842|0|If the choppy screenplay could have been tightly scripted, there would have been something more convincing to forcefully sing about regarding this divine but disjointed ditty
60177|1|Deeply creepy and richly satisfying.
6786|1|Sexual stereotyping provides the grist for much of Martin Lawrence's humor and, for the most part, it's on target.
30007|1|It put Glenn Ford on the movie star map, and reinforced Rita Hayworth's seamy stardom.
88373|1|Jentsch keep[s] up a subtle, restrained performance while the movie Nazis around her are screaming themselves red in the face. She succeeds beyond all expectation.
56100|1|Even if you're an agnostic carnivore, you can enjoy much of Jonah simply, and gratefully, as laugh-out-loud lunacy with a pronounced Monty Pythonesque flavor.
30944|1|I definitely see its appeal and influence. It's tasteless, shameless, and nasty. And I mean that in the most positive way.
49439|1|It really is Redford's show. He works things so smoothly and with such a silver tongue that you honestly do believe the man was a top spy for the government.
71290|1|Bergman wants the viewer to empathize more with the characters' perseverance than their pain, and he pulls it off, thanks to his sharp eye, compassion, and humor, and of course to the performances -- particularly that of the luminous Maron.
26782|1|Dick Tracy is skillfully mounted, generating an optical wonderland for the viewer, with all sorts of details and photographic vibrancy to study when the film takes off on the wings of a tune.
81200|0|A parade of sadism and misanthropy.
94861|1|Cashback is light, smart, and enjoyable, and it makes me eager to see what Ellis has planned for his next outing.
89742|0|It would have taken a more imaginative approach and vision not within the reach of Howard and Goldsman to make the material come alive as a movie.
59365|1|Tukur's performance is the centerpiece of the movie; it's a wonderful mixture of outrage and swiftly disappearing naivete.
28283|1|The film isn't as blisteringly satirical as The Simpsons; it's warmer. And while its nostalgia isn't simplistic, it is affectionate.
10861|0|It's a movie best seen through the hazy amber filter of '80s nostalgia, and if you're watching it without those rose-colored glasses on, God help you.
44240|1|Brilliant war film that creates tension through words, not bullets.
102225|0|In the history of marital discord in the movies, has there ever been a blander conflict than the one between firefighter Kirk Cameron and his goodly wife Erin Bethea in the dismal Christian-themed melodrama Fireproof?
9568|1|A women's weepie picture.
48912|1|Although well made, this is a depressing film.
79042|1|One of the most popular and best received crime films ever.
70747|1|Better when it's resisting the need to be about something, the movie starts strong.
63542|1|There's much to like here -- a gag-filled script, impressive visuals and Michelle Pfeiffer's classy villainess.
73011|1|Great fun, as these things go, with a Bernard Herrmann score to boot.
14205|1|Little more than a flawed romp, but energetic and enjoyable, with sterling performances from Sutherland and Estevez.
66830|1|In just observing and accurately reproducing women's facial expressions and physical gestures, the men create a wonderfully absurd spectacle.
25426|1|A marvellous film.
63639|0|A bit of a mess.
64867|0|Brainless, explosion-happy action ('80s style).
84910|0|The concept alone is misguided, awkward, and distracting. The plot is no improvement.
31519|1|Deneuve gives an astonishing, clinically accurate performance ...
56288|1|It was for a long time regarded by horror fans as the finest horror film ever made.
18897|0|You're best advised to put your head in the sand and avoid all three sequels.
87873|1|How each person copes with trauma and renewal adds up to a tender tale rich in memorable performances.
349|1|It's part of the joke here that Chili is a die-hard cineaste and loves reminiscing about smart, stylish tough-guy films he has enjoyed. Get Shorty belongs on that list.
14619|1|Roeg creates in Walkabout a world of his own, a microcosmos that is at once beautiful, primitive, wild, familiar yet unfamiliar, thoughtful, and thought provoking.
13729|1|All time horror classic starring Lugosi; still creepy as blazes.
86658|1|At its best when it taps into the allure of indolence: The almost scandalous feeling of freedom that comes from sitting on a barstool in midafternoon, without a job, a schedule or responsibilities.
73502|1|Outdated but still fine as an historical curio.
89760|0|The film exists solely to give the Comic Book Guys of the world a chance to see all their favorite action figures, life size and in full form.
26375|1|This edgy little bit of nastiness is a good reason to start getting excited about British movies all over again.
48619|1|Rich in authentic-looking period detail and punctuated with powerful acting, Eastwood's tale holds you in its firm, grim grip.
9303|1|In the hands of a master craftsman, even this otherwise iffy musical becomes lively, lovely entertainment.
34137|1|Jarmusch blends these disparate themes into a cohesive film that combines humor and truly unique characters with Eastern philosophy, mobster flick and shoot-'em-up western.
14903|0|Dated '90s romcom has some stereotypes, innuendo.
51882|1|Wonderful voices in family delight.
71218|0|A ho-hum piece of junk.
58079|0|Neither as good as its direct ancestor nor as clever as the original Friday, this is, to put it bluntly, all seeds and stems.
45770|1|Worthy conmen comedy with a great cast.
18493|1|"sometimes ambitious failures are more interesting to watch than modest successes, and, though ""Bulworth"" may offend... it's unlikely to bore anyone."
76768|1|It can be forgiven for its many flaws.
67785|1|It is the gifted performance of Maria Falconetti as the Maid of Orleans that rises above everything in this artistic achievement.
59928|0|Gory but not particularly effective Argento horror flick, complete with his usual touches: secret villain, topless Italian beauties, and an overbearing organ score.
93130|0|A ghastly sort of Nora Ephron-ish good taste pervades this romcom-tearjerker.
25166|1|Society is restored as before, but it's a society based on victims and victimizers. De Sade rewrites Darwin.
31963|1|Places in the Heart is a loving, reflective homage to his hometown by writer-director Robert Benton.
101731|0|Overall, Zucker's cinematic middle finger is about as funny as an exploding toilet seat for hemorrhoid-induced senior citizens...a dreary picture mired in sophomoric sludge.
36243|0|Marathon Man desperately yearns for acceptance among the canon of socially important, gritty, subversive 1970s 'New School' films.
15557|0|"Critics have panned the film for lacking Spielberg's usual ""magic"" touch, but an awe of sorts persists: nature retains a purity that people have lost."
78462|1|At some point very early in the 3-D IMAX version of The Polar Express, technology trumps banality and you helplessly surrender to the shock and awe of this big, often thunderous movie.
74597|0|Unfortunately, once the film turns into a romance, the movie degenerates into a snoozy Catholic vs. Protestant melodrama as Christina is wooed by a Spanish noble.
52207|1|There's enough classically derived Road Runner-type fun to keep most family audiences happy. But the characters betray their contrivance.
64610|1|There's plenty of mileage in this pairing, even if the movie isn't going anywhere unexpected.
1480|0|Mr. Allen asks the audience to believe that an irresistible sexual tension arises out of the oil-and-vinegar combination of Betty Ann and C.W.; instead, they look and sound utterly uncomfortable together.
64500|1|The sheer charisma of the performances - from a screwball Murphy and a caustic Fanning - manages to float a sentimental script that frequently fizzes where it should pop.
24739|1|It makes you think and ask questions. Its characters contradict themselves, talking one way, acting another. And it ends abruptly, with many things unresolved. Like life.
81984|0|Failing in its attempts at Zhang Yimou-like poetry, Azumi calls to mind a long, blood-splattered director's cut of a Power Rangers episode.
64675|1|Meditative and downbeat rather than crowd-pleasing, the film includes a few sequences that suggest the direction Lucas career later took.
20933|0|Making his directorial bow, choreographer Kenny Ortega strains valiantly to breathe life into this misguided musical.
95423|1|Skinwalkers wears its B-movie badness on its sleeve like a badge of honor.
74200|1|[an] unexpectedly harmonious marriage of German expressionism and Hollywood romanticism.
102579|1|Well directed by W. S. Van Dyke, superbly photographed by famed Chinese Cinematographer James Wong Howe, Manhattan Melodrama is first-rate cinema, chiefly important because it marks the elevation to stardom of Myrna Loy.
58518|0|Offensive, vile, and, even worse, not funny.
101797|0|Football fan or not, definitely be sure to see it.
49889|1|Director Jack Arnold works up the chills for maximum effect by the time Williams is down to two inches and the family cat takes after him.
45208|1|Peter O'TOole and Katharine Hepburn are superb as the bickering, yet loving Henry II and his meddling wife Eleanor of Aquitaine.
47182|1|If you've never experienced Frank Henenlotter's insane masterpiece that lovingly celebrates the sometimes schlocky and sleazy side of cinema, then I can't think of a better introduction than this.
41535|1|A bouncy, high-energy spoof and one of the best movie musicals of the last couple of decades.
11932|1|It's as good as you remember.
28678|1|Never boring, and holds up wonderfully to repeated viewings.
89482|1|The movie, redolent of death, is a sort of wake, but a funny-sad one, teeming with music, corny jokes, and an ensemble of gifted performers who appear to be having an obscene amount of fun in one another's company.
73081|1|From the first battle to the heartrending climax, you will emerge feeling dirty and scarred.
68701|1|In The Court Jester, Funnyman Kaye takes all the laughs he needs, but he takes them when they do not stop the show.
88046|0|It doesn't make a lick of sense, largely because none of these characters acts like a recognizable human being.
51512|0|It forever misses, unlike American Graffiti, the heady sexual climate of adolescence to concentrate on the circumstances of the sex act itself.
39839|0|A particularly painful mess, because it begins so well and has such promise.
10940|0|[The film has] a smug faith in the ability of its own speed, smartness and luxe to wow the yokels.
43539|0|The mummy may, but the audience shouldn't.
23519|1|A smart picture, if not a brilliant one.
51893|0|Inane!
87056|1|The movie itself is the message, a series of cool, beautiful, often enigmatic scenes that flow one into another with the rhythm of blank verse.
81425|1|the mind-blowing story and its reality-bending aesthetic form a sublime continuum, where the medium becomes part of the message...this is animation at its most acute and enthralling.
18463|0|"The picture's fatal flaw is its inability to give us any consistent sense of Godzilla's size."""
100778|0|A witless reprise of '60s and '70s biker movies written, directed by, and starring Larry Bishop.
27184|1|The 3-D process leaves the image somewhat murky, but you can discern sparks of authentic pulp poetry throughout.
77386|0|Like Elvis Presley, Prince has the charisma to carry an atrocious movie-real fans just want to see him-but even Elvis never got so carried away with himself that he thought he could direct.
75089|0|Shelley Long wanders through a script she can't carry by herself while heading a cast handled with less than a Midas touch by director Frank Perry, who seems to think he's staging a high school play.
83314|1|Gentle story of friendship is fine for wee ones.
21145|0|It's somewhere around minute 58 - that's in a film that runs 80 minutes before credits, folks - before anything particularly interesting happens.
54511|1|Aside from over-interpreting the monster movie's politics, there's no denying that the true star of 20 Million Miles to Earth is clearly animator Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion monster.
69700|0|Imagine Emmanuelle remade on a shoestring budget or Eyes Wide Shut staged by a community theater group.
10664|1|Probably Gene Wilder's finest, most manic hour.
92607|0|A strong cast [is] shortchanged by a director who can't trust his audience to feel anything not loaded with exclamation points.
77295|0|The great cast should work together again on a project that aspires to be more than just pleasent. Not a bad movie, just a little too obvious.
35437|0|...things just move quickly from one person's conflicts to another, with little momentum or feeling of satisfaction.
60768|1|The film's final reel is the only vital weakness in an otherwise nasty but effective exposé on the abuses by those in and with power on those without.
34296|0|Recommended only for the most devoted soap fans, 'East-West' earns our early nominations both for Fuzziest-Thinking Director and for Most Pretentious Film of the Year.
71216|0|There's no way your own children deserve something as lifeless and hollow as Agent Cody Banks 2. Unless they're misbehaving really bad, I guess.
51622|1|A succinct effort to explore how our relationships force us to re-evaluate what we want out of life at the most inopportune and unexpected of times.
39710|1|A great old family-time adventure ... and it's educational!
86073|0|I saw Cho perform much of this material live [...] and found it bracingly hilarious. The movie she has made of it is an entirely different matter.
72434|0|James Bond is old. Wrinkled-forehead old. Lecherous-coot old. Strategic-hairstyle old. Senior meal-discount old. Simply ... old. That's the biggest takeaway from Roger Moore's second-worst outing as 007, hot on the heels of his second-best.
63491|1|"It's disposable fun, best summed up by Banner himself when asked how he feels during his transformation: ""There's just too much noise... it's difficult to remember anything at all."""
45273|1|Rides on the strong and intense performance by Klaus Maria Brandaur.
55557|1|Writer/director Burr Steers displays a pitch-perfect sense of the way Igby is at once repelled by his family and his upbringing and yet an unmistakable product of it.
45983|0|While the film has the charm of rose-tinted retrospect and is often very funny, the pacing is wrong (it seems much longer than it is) and the sex scenes fail to convince.
13588|1|I am one of the least likely people on this planet to be recommending a documentary about the grunge movement in Seattle. Nevertheless, this review will do precisely that.
60235|1|The quintessential 50s Rom-Com.
10391|1|Solid action movie. Davis kicks ass, Jackson is in his usual form. Could have used more family implications, but does okay.
82895|1|Tragically underseen, this Preston Sturges comedy is all of 68 minutes long (including the credits) and is a freakin' laugh riot from start to finish.
47234|1|Less compelling than the first, but fun for fans.
25115|1|Running Scared exists in that world of movies where there are no good guys - just bad guys, worse guys and worst guys.
91064|1|The music, which sounds like a collaboration between Cab Calloway and Run DMC, keeps the story flowing.
28385|0|This all has the potential to become a sidesplitting caper. ... Unfortunately, only a few of the manic scenes work.
88174|0|At the rate Boll's improving, he'll achieve a film worthy of a thumbs up rating sometime late next decade.
39703|1|Well directed science fiction
12839|0|Fun, though the title couldn't be more apt.
71673|1|Visually striking and exceptionally performed by old and young alike, I'm Not Scared plucks the nerves.
3929|1|Iain Softley directs his feature debut with simplicity and feeling, and you don't have to have been a Beatles fan to get with the beat. Gives you hope for the British film industry.
93693|1|[W]here Se7en, with its stygian gloom and theatrical executions, inflated the serial killer genre to gothic proportions, Zodiac lets the air back out. It is methodical rather than macabre, clinical rather than cruel.
80141|1|Most easily described as 'deliciously nasty,' though some moments are far from delicious.
58887|0|You can rely on Goldthwaite to demolish sentimental notions with the power of a force ten gale, but clumsy filmmaking seriously hampers his idea's own effectiveness, resulting in a rather plodding black comedy.
22770|0|Yes, it's true: in this astonishingly distasteful bit of dreck, there is at the bottom a sappy little romance.
56331|0|Jaglom offers the none-too-original premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar.
100512|0|Directed by Julian Jarrold from a script by Andrew Davies and Jeremy Brock, this new adaptation adroitly condenses Waugh's plot while eliminating or reversing most of his intended meanings.

9799|1|A sharp, smart movie peppered with A-grade performances from its B-list cast.
97239|0|Excruciating pap
21914|1|The supposedly invisible editing is more of a distraction than being really innovative.
33279|0|This is another one of those dreary retreads about a bunch of kids with no faith in themselves, and about how an inspiring teacher coaches them into the State Finals, where they upset the snobs from the rich school.
2210|1|Unlike most of the Hollywood Gen X movies, Party Girl actually looks as if it were made from the inside.
37846|0|A horrendously written and acted movie which even Walken can't save.
76337|0|It's painful.
76527|1|Garson Kanin is not Leo McCarey, who was originally assigned to direct this screwball comedy, reuniting Cary Grant and Irene Dunne (Awful Truth), but he has made a well acted, decent, and enjoyable film.

42141|1|Adults will enjoy it more than they expect.
21392|1|"What makes ""Atlantic City"" sweet -- and that's the word for it -- is the gentleness with which Lou handles his last chance at amounting to something, and the wisdom with which Sally handles Lou."
41295|0|It's a movie that parades authenticity, but never settles on its own point of view.
16564|1|This dark comedy will not be for everyone. But if you're in the mood for something perversely entertaining and disturbing, you might want to check it out.
57657|1|Columbus carefully avoids overly replaying the visual wonders of his first episode, and heedfully edits and amplifies Rowling's story for the screen, preserving its spooky darkness.
28246|0|Everything is spelt out laboriously with a glum and squeakily pretentious air.
86178|1|Before I saw this film, only one movie, Field of Dreams, had ever made me cry. Now there are two.
64606|0|[A] hysterically oversold mix of comic cliches from the 30s and the 80s.
68714|1|Bullitt takes a rather simple nugget of a story and turns it into a crime classic through the expert use of location footage, editing, music, mood and timing, not to mention the laconic, stoic performance of ultra-cool star Steve McQueen.
87344|0|Sidetracked by a slew of unbelievable coincidences ... When the going gets tough, Aniston looks as out of place as a Prada bag on the south side of Chicago.
77075|0|Laughably poor prequel that is dumb, nonsensical and not remotely scary -- however, it remains watchable thanks to Stellan Skarsgard.
59637|1|Just when you've had it with the mistimed scenes and the clunky direction, writer-director Andrew Bergman comes through with an inspired piece of lunacy.
91801|0|The film is populated with such self-obsessed, distasteful characters, it's hard to care how or why any of them finds happiness.

100270|1|Mainstream attempts at melodrama, sweeping crane shots and a Charlotte Gray gloss unbalance Wajda's desired mood.
78661|0|With a better script, Closer could have been compelling romantic drama; instead, it's little more than clichéd nonsense.
39196|0|The plot is horribly predictable, and the method to the bad guys' madness is confusing.
2263|1|Berkley's acting début is a joy, if you can call it acting: she jumps up and down a lot to indicate excitement.
42776|1|It's presented with Lee's usual intelligence and clarity as he skilfully mixes politics with moving reminders of the lives it affects.
11231|1|I sincerely hope The People Versus Larry Flynt goes all the way and wins the Academy Award.
53065|1|Sinister sibling-rivalry drama is majorly creepy.
62463|1|For a horror cheese-fest about six ill-fated teens on the verge of brutal maceration by inbred hick monsters, Wrong Turn is surprisingly worth the detour
101915|1|A real departure for Van Dame, but it ought to help his career. Who knew he could act?
48867|1|Moore might not be merrier, but this is far from offal.

328|1|"""Money Train"" is a by-the-numbers action-buddy picture, and few directors run through those numbers as smoothly as Joseph Ruben."
46901|1|Efficient enough as a thriller, but what makes this mandatory viewing is the return of Pacino.
78654|0|It's the first Godard film in years that hasn't made me want to rip out handfuls of my hair and then jump out a window. Does that count as a comeback?
44860|1|Buried in the mess is a modest, thoughtful film.
64032|0|It has nice little touches, and some solid performances, but in the end nothing is accomplished. It is as though the film itself is unemployed.
55107|1|Mostly Martha glides so effortlessly from comedy to drama that you may be surprised how often you are laughing and crying at the same time.
85045|1|Amy Fox's play, with New York clichés for characters, was never going to hit, ahem, the movie heights. But cut loose in the middle of a comic-book summer, Heights is just different enough, just adult enough, to warrant a climb and a look.
2598|1|Iconoclastic acting by Marlon Brando, Johnny Depp and Faye Dunaway elevate this likable comedy about love, illusion and delusion way above its inconsequential text.
100532|0|If you are going to go back to the 90s for source material, it had better come juiced with some modern day action.
17418|1|To what do we owe the pleasure of the Coen Brothers' new joie de vivre and love for their fellow man?
36583|1|Now pretty sexist comedy with Michael Keaton assuming household duties.
18513|0|More headache than head trip.
40580|0|This convoluted, sloppily made film looks like it was cut down from a four-hour length with a machete.
98628|1|Does it match the hype? Yes.
36245|0|...not a genuinely convincing thriller, but one that makes us think we're seeing something more important than it is because of the virtues of its participants.
51322|1|A perfectly respectable, perfectly inoffensive, easily forgettable film.
2426|0|No one looking for an action movie is going to choose this one. Equally obviously, no one interested in a film about racial stereotyping in America wants to sit through chase scenes.
28840|0|At its best, this achieves the beauty and grandeur of a Kurosawa epic -- at its worst, however, it feels like a Python remake of The Vikings.
21334|1|Has just enough dark comedy to make it memorable.
32068|0|Can anyone fail to recognize this as a fundamental betrayal of the author’s creative vision?
37039|1|Moonraker, the newest James Bond spectacle, is a cheerful, splashy entertainment. The curators of the Bond museum do not surpass themselves with this exhibition, the 11th in the series, but they haven't fallen down on the job either.
58040|0|Perhaps it's time to say goodbye to Mr. Bond.
83271|1|The talky debate over scientific morality is simplistic to say the least, but there is a sneaky undercurrent of social satire and a retro glory to the animation...
25883|1|An interesting sci-fi movie that does a great job with the approach proposed by Crichton and has Yul Brynner as a memorable villain. [Full review in Spanish]
97627|0|Most people seeing this movie might wonder what Queen Latifah did to convince Terrence Howard to take on what will surely be his worst role of the year.
96406|1|This is an epic, to be sure, but it is also a melodrama, a soap opera of titanic scale and bluster.
26896|1|Does this allusive, delicate story work? The answer is yes, provided you are sympathetic with what Bertolucci is trying to do.
87200|1|A sweetly compassionate Israeli offering that has its heart firmly established in the home and the hearth.
90082|1|Director Ivan Reitman is a good choice for this sort of thing - like Evolution, it's undeniably silly but extremely entertaining with it.
50888|0|'No one was expecting Remains of the Day but this film could have been more than just a Dawson's Creek stop gap.'
101688|1|The film has a dream-like quality above its punchy emotional core
34514|1|Episodic and vaguely surreal, it is the antithesis of a Hollywood film that tells us what to feel. Having unfolded an ever-widening series of moral questions, it deliberately leaves them hanging.
65238|1|This is a film about the abuses of privatization and presents a negative view of what might happen if corporate America gets control of the business of corrections.
78985|1|Von Stroheim's groundbreaking film is still intriguing.
500|1|He's brave and bright, good-natured and ambitious, naive and vulnerable. All in all, he's probably the most winsome orphan to appear on the screen since Freddie Bartholomew impersonated David Copperfield 60 years ago.
22413|0|The Ring doesn't have the wiliness or conviction to exploit either a single mother's guilt over child neglect or our collective queasiness over potential bad seeds. It merely alternates these themes and toys with them.
30443|0|I don't recommend it, unless you care to see the best Nicolas Cage performance in several years, or some more of Scorcese's brilliant camera work.
93612|1|So enjoyable and visually stimulating is the experience, it's tough to knock Crialese's Door.
85796|0|It couldn't hold my attention despite the event being such a celebrated one in American history.
90776|1|Ireland ... has in Friend and Plowright the exactly right actors to give friendship a glow of platonic soul romance.
81454|0|You feel insulted you're expected to care about the petty problems of the leads when other characters are dealing with child murder, political torture and genocide.
78633|0|Oh boy. This was a painful experience. Very painful.
36495|0|By emphasizing big battles and spilled blood, Scott banks on the hope the movie audience will be no more discerning than the Colosseum's screaming mob.
85316|1|Se você valoriza a construção consistente de um clima de melancolia e tensão, dificilmente se decepcionará.
464|1|For those who thought films could do nothing new, prepare to be surprised.
37288|1|Raw emotions, both uplifting and depressing, are captured.
6399|1|hilariously provocative and almost too real
46196|1|...it's impossible not to derive some pleasure out of Caine and Kingsley's effortless chemistry with one another...
55569|0|There's not much worth noting about this Disney attempt at maritime comedy.
87292|0|Painfully light on laughs.
50167|0|...An average, workmanlike production, virtually indistinguishable from any other example of the pat, easily digested, box-office-successful formula faithfully churned out by Hollywood every day of the year.
95243|1|There's a nagging feeling of dad trying to rush the family on a vacation. If you hurry this much, you're bound to miss something and that keeps the Potter films away from greatness.
28822|0|Connery & Bracco run through the jungle. Yawn.
37466|0|Schwarzenegger sadistically dispatches the baddies, enunciating typical wisecrack remarks (many repeated from his previous films), but it's all too easy.
88334|1|Neat little chiller with Polanski honing his abilities as a director and standout performances from Pleasence, Stander, and Dorleac.
101530|1|It's a lovely movie, with abundant charm and no fear of suffering.
66575|0|To say that production designer Richard Sylbert, costume designer Ellen Mirojnick and cinematographer Lajos Koltai give the settings a handsome, authentic look is like saying that the Titanic had nice chandeliers.
88770|0|A jumble of bad movie cliches strung together into an overly simplistic tale of a pooch who gets in trouble over candy.
94146|0|Needs hosing down.
33589|1|Scabrously powerful, the film, arguably Ferrara's best, dives into the addictive psyche, splendidly played by Harvey Keitel.
60419|1|Fascinating and compulsively watchable.
21674|0|This doggie has fleas.
31878|1|Ron Howard's film is one of smoke-eaters, crispers, and torches... and it bestows a renewed respect on a profession all too often taken for granted.
43566|1|A gorgeous cough syrup hallucination -- the kind of beautiful, feverish dream to which you succumb while eardrum-piercingly high on over-the-counter cold medicine.
95897|0|Don't hire Kevin Bacon for a role you wrote for Charles Bronson.
68192|1|From the opening scenes with Murray dressed as a clown for the robbery and playing his cynical, wise-cracking card to great effect, to the trio pitting themselves against the whims of New York City, this is breathtaking and inventive stuff.
47228|0|What starts as a feel-good movie quickly degenerates into a feel-bored movie, not least because at two hours it's at least thirty minutes too long.
77352|0|As a film director, Prince remains a brilliant musician.
24808|0|Columbus' awkward direction randomly maneuvers the audience's emotions from grieving to giddy.
60423|1|Until Stone Reader, no film ever captured the thrill and romance of reading.
54087|1|a highly underrated film that anyone can enjoy -- even if you aren't a massive, massive nerd.
14206|1|Far better western than the brat pack deserved
60955|0|No one comes off worse than Cuba Gooding, Jr., whom the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences could sue for defamation had the movie's advertisements put 'Academy Award winner' before his name.
17866|1|Good things come in small packages
17979|1|"ustralian-born singer/songwriter Nick Cave pens his second film (after ""Ghosts ... Of The Civil Dead"") and generates a prescient allegory about imperialism."
87424|1|Walk the line es la vivencia de un hombre, entregándose al baile de sus demonios, para después enfrentarlos y salir avante de ellos.
10226|1|It's just the sort of thing Oliver Stone strove so hard to achieve in Natural Born Killers, and [writer/director Matthew] Bright pulls it off effortlessly.
68072|0|This deliberately paced, almost monochromatic movie reserves its real energy and color for blaming the victim.
40884|0|The premise for What Women Want sounds like, and is, the dumbest thing going.
59955|0|wait, what?
95769|1|rather clever! Bynes is her usual bubbly, entertaining-self
46354|0|even Keaton can't make this clunker click
21568|1|No Mickey, but a nice mouse.
98234|0|The film gets a full 'This is a work of fiction' disclaimer, even noting that any resemblance to any person living or dead is unintentional. That tells you something about how much trust to put in these historical CliffsNotes.
41814|1|The plot is standard fantasy-adventure pulp, though director Joe Dante has so many screwball things going on in it that the comedy all but overwhelms the formulaic line of action.
66756|1|Here's an anomaly: a comedy about smart people.
21571|0|It may be that the truly American tale here is the spectacle of an artist squandering his awesome gifts on the way to becoming a Hollywood institution.
6352|1|Based on an early script from Tarantino, Tony Scott's wild movie is amour fou for youth of the 1990s, a gutsy, violent, often exciting picture likely to divide film critics.
699|0|One of the most scattered of the studio's famed animated features.
29482|0|It's as painful to watch as Rodman's star-posturing interviews.
36280|0|Dumb and irritating.
68691|1|Sellers is on full tilt in this one.
25286|1|The second half of the film it's especially fun watching this Australian roughneck deal with local customs, traffic jams, subways, streetlights, and a rival for Sue's attention-her boss.
38826|0|There's little to enjoy about this second outing save for Scrimm's deliciously menacing specter of death.
22859|1|It is a tribute to the film's earnestness that we are able to overlook most of its absurdities and simply revel in its deeds.
40485|0|This past summer's claymation hit, Chicken Run, has clearly stolen, and bettered, this film's bark and bite.
36544|1|This movie liberated the cinema -- the stories you could tell and the ways you could tell them -- as clearly and cleanly as Picasso freed painting and the Sex Pistols rebooted rock.
11997|1|Wonderfully funny, bitterly sad film.
17591|0|Landis apparently lost almost any trace of inspiration or creativity.
90347|0|About on the level of a freshman frat party.

84529|1|The strong point of this gripping dramatic story set in pioneer Wyoming is a constantly mounting suspense.
24403|0|The weakest of the Rambo trilogy, but still a fun film to watch if you're in the mood for explosions and Stallone at his muscle-bound grunting best.
64589|0|Too silly-minded and broad to digest. Lloyd is wasted in this nonsensical narrative by Roth's undisciplined spotty script
870|0|Dreary, murky, and senseless.
72174|1|Because the camera so closely follows Duncan -- there's scarcely a scene he's off-frame; his awkwardness is bold and unapologetic -- he sticks close to our sympathies.
102089|1|It's one of the most likable of all the Westerns directed by John Ford.
97402|1|It's essentially a gloriously romantic film made by a very romantic filmmaker who can see beauty where none supposedly exists.
43676|1|There's a numbness to the entire cumulative experience. That's where its true effect lies, and Fellini Satyricon is mostly a reminder of how wide open and full of possibility this particular time in cinema was.
89751|0|X-ecrable.
42119|0|Para Chris Rock, el estrellato que se pensaba podía adquirir con su primer estelar tendrá que esperar hasta una mejor oportunidad
27512|0|A horrifically dreadful vampire teensploitation entry.

24812|0|A packet of weepie nonsense!

19375|1|A treasure of a movie.
27934|1|...straddles the stylistic gulf between David Lynch and the Coen brothers. It is a creepy film, beautiful in odd and disturbing ways.

44347|1|Manages to be funny and touching without ever resorting to schmaltz.
83327|0|even a toddler found it too uninteresting to stick around
64901|1|Buñuel and Carriere give us dreams within dreams, fantasies within fantasies and stories within stories, all punctuated by scenes of the six striding purposefully along a deserted country road, resolutely headed nowhere,.
11523|1|Visually brilliant, powerful thriller.
81517|1|Ozpetek ends up with a lot of balls in the air, and he has to do some scrambling to keep up. He pulls it off, but it feels like he's making this harder than it needs to be.
89310|1|... a surprisingly strong coming-of-age movie with a great young cast. It pops with color and humor and pays attention to the details that situate it in a real location ...
98233|0|The falling blade is the only element not missing the mark in this film. I wanted to call for the beheading after Act One, and spare the audience instead.
8436|0|I don't think the book is a masterpiece but the film is just plain disappointing.
82733|0|I really wish I could have liked this more.
47227|0|Despite the hackneyed quality of the pretext, nice performances save this film from itself.
51595|0|This ambitious drama about a Vietnam vet trying to create fiction out of his troubled life and former marriage (to Debra Winger) is messy, rambling, and overlong.
21685|1|It's a Styrofoam-cup comedy, lightweight and disposable, but this G-rated fantasy of suburban family life is a good bet for its intended audience of 12-year-olds and younger.
59744|1|Allen has no affinity for Renoir's robust generosity, yet this study does wonders for his filmmaking
43699|1|Fellini is as firmly associated with Rome as Julius Caesar.
47659|0|The problem with this romantic comedy is that although it eventually winds its way to a conclusion that feels right, it takes too many convoluted steps to get there.
31862|1|A beautifully moving, life-affirming true story.
24277|1|"Not one of the most successful of the ""Star Trek"" films, it's always nice to see the cast reunite."
77029|1|Great performances and candid dialogue don't make up all the essence of a great film. The actual story itself is where the film falls flat.
72552|1|Melville's film had a major influence in Hollywood.
65250|0|After two smart acts, the film almost becomes the exploitation flick it so desperately wants to avoid.
54571|1|Medem has once again crafted a complex, ethereal film that's both delicate and earthy, full of memorable imagery, gutsy performances and unforgettable, haunting themes.
28266|1|A bright and sassy comedy!
60477|1|This audacious hypothetical is at once funny and dramatic, sometimes a little lopsided but always interesting
101687|1|A dense story about a little girl and the impact her mother's death has on her makes terrific cinema in this beautifully realised film
25749|0|Capsule Review
44273|1|In an age when self-acceptance and taking a hold of one's destiny is more relevant than ever, Big Eden may be the right inspirational movie for our evolving times.
15156|0|A sickly soft-swirl confection of low laughs and smarmy sentiment...
84876|0|Its conclusion can be viewed as a major disappointment.
31752|1|There's a self-awareness to Shampoo that gives the movie a cleansing sadness and, oddly, makes Beatty an affectingly amoral roue.
69745|0|For arthouse fans this should be a must - filled as it is with lingering shots, awkward silences and the growing weight of knowing that no character will end up smiling.
101594|0|Kevin Smith has placed a black mark on an otherwise solid filmography by selling himself short in a bid to shock new viewers and win back old ones with Zack and Miri Make a Porno.
41529|1|A wonderful performance from Diane Keaton pulls the movie through.
74117|1|No matter what you think of the script, it's impossible to dismiss what's up on the screen.
100474|1|The film plays like an unholy marriage between the realist films noir of the '40s like The Naked City and the early independent dramas of John Cassavetes...
30214|0|"Fight Club may be iconic and technically proficient, but it's more distant than perhaps any film to attain ""modern classic"" status."
58398|0|Unsatisfactory both for fans of star-studded prison escape dramas and for football fans hoping to see cunningly devised tactics from Pele and his squad of internationals.
28477|1|The title calls out for lustrous Freudian hysteria, and Corman delivers
80527|1|It unfolds like a particularly cool episode of The Twilight Zone and it keeps the apocalypse interesting up to and including the deliciously ambiguous finale.
4864|1|Arguably the greatest ever B-movie.
18328|0|Unwatchable drivel.
63499|1|It won't change your life but you'll walk away smiling.
84679|0|The plotting keeps getting away from Kim as the story progresses.
13526|0|Looking at the film with a totally modern set of eyes, completely detached from the hype of Newman and Redford in the late 60s, I didn't find a connection to the movie.
82612|0|It's a lazy-looking movie, amiable and smart, but so fuzzy, in its imagery and structure, that it suggests the sun is getting to everybody, that they all need a dip in the pool.
30841|1|This hilarious, touching film is even more wonderful because it's real.
4936|1|Stronger in its suspense and action elements than in its dramatic moments.
81625|1|The best parts of this movie are the gritty and grisly fight sequences that have a power and intensity you don't find in many movies nowadays.
15811|0|Sporadically engaging.
17922|1|In a moviemaking world dominated by attention to secular matters, the parochial Wide Awake is a refreshing change of pace.
14557|1|Uma versão à altura (senão melhor) do clássico de Laurence Olivier.
4823|0|No one will be blown away by this formula thriller.
15547|0|"When it gets serious, ""Brassed Off"" is maudlin, mediocre and maddening. And, unfortunately, it gets more and more serious as it progresses."
36025|1|Harron' s incisive eye and Bale' s bravura performance carry the day.
74533|1|Plot intricacies are deftly interwoven, with director Fritz Lang doing a topflight job of balancing the ingredients without dragging the pace.
5794|1|A Perfect World is really two films. One is mediocre at best, but the other is one of the best films of the year. Together, they still add up to one of the better films of the year.
60104|0|Ok for kids, but not the most inspired sequel.
32413|0|The rest of these animated sequences depend on gimmickry, cuteness, or facile ideology.
36547|1|There is simply no other film which demonstrates so perfectly what it feels like to be young and in love.
71448|1|A well-acted and interesting dark comedy, but the convoluted writing becomes the big drawback.

76308|1|A story as big, as brash, and as exciting as the west itself.
859|0|A tired, humorless pastiche of various exploitation genres that is not the least bit imaginative in its campy deconstruction of conventions.
38296|1|The choice of Clive Owen as the star is a good one. He's got the same sort of physical reserve as Sean Connery in the Bond pictures.
63106|0|What do you do to decide who gets the girl? Do you fight? Arm-wrestle, perhaps? Why, no, silly. You play hovercraft basketball, of course.

79959|0|The movie is a facile enough pastiche of underground pyrotechnics and Euro-art pretensions, but far more evocative now is the fast, offhand repartee between the principals.

74162|1|Polished Korean political-action film is just as good -- and bad -- as Hollywood action epics. Is this progress?
95185|0|License To Wed never escapes the combined trap of terminal blandness and a severe lack of decent jokes.

21412|1|Though Ingrid and Ingmar Bergman aren't related, their pairing on a movie set was a long-anticipated event
93732|1|Awesome!
16367|0|Fire Down Below is an action film that's deadly slow and stupid -- like most of the mountain people portrayed in the film.
60364|1|As comedy and drama, the film is full on, if not full monty... Wonderful performances keep us involved and engaged.
35212|0|Like some kind of perverse cinematic plague, the teen comedies keep coming, each looking like a more washed-out xerox of the last one.
56059|0|It lacks the compassion, good-natured humor and the level of insight that made [Eyre's] first film something of a sleeper success.
16628|0|My own reaction to the current version fashioned by Mr. Schumacher is one of pure stupefaction.

36981|1|Just as entertaining and as visually attractive as the five previous Bond films.

73844|1|An irresistible bauble that showcases one of the best of the 13 performances Mia Farrow delivered in an Allen production.
57578|1|It's easy to like Jimmy Smith as well as to admire him, because Mr. Mathers lets us in, with no sign of calculation, on the kindness, even tenderness, that Jimmy conceals from most of the people around him.

7409|1|Warmhearted remake of TV classic has some scary moments.

100951|0|Amiable enough yet unadventurous and uneven, this may coax the odd big smile from viewers but it never rocks the house.
24770|1|Entertaining enough.

22212|0|A film even Hitchcock didn't care for.
86377|1|Pic amply demonstrates that Alexander -- director of Johnny Flynton, 2003 Oscar nominee for dramatic short -- has the chops to bring a fresh take to onscreen rough stuff.

19994|1|Chucky is as good being bad as ever but the story falls short
86249|0|The filmmakers produced a mindless action movie that isn't mindless enough.
90420|1|A superbly subtle thriller that represents director Carol Reed and British Tradition of Quality (in black and white) at their very best. It's hard to think of another tale that captures a child's awakening disillusionment in a more perceptive way.

43830|1|...less dogmatic and milder than most of Loach's work, with a kind of sweet dignity about it
16726|1|Benefits immensely from being graded on a curve: it's no Ghostbusters, but it's no Police Academy either.
85758|0|[It] runs an excruciatingly long 1:23 -- one minute of this movie would last a lifetime

81094|1|"Takashi Miike has a style that definitely sets this one apart from the all of the American ""stalker chick"" films."
7684|1|For all its japes and jokes, the movie is really about exhaustion of the spirit: sitting in a bleak hotel suite at 4 a.m. with the bad taste of last night in the mouth and the feeling that tomorrow will not be a better day.
44445|1|Those two faces are incredible in juxtaposition: Russell is worldly, amused, intensely in touch: Monroe is sublimely unfocused and beatific. A joy.

58235|1|Just because the characters are crazy, that doesn't mean they are not smart.
20163|1|Of its type, great fun--at least for kids.
98915|0|As a writer, Waters is best-known for creating Ryder's sharp black comedy, Heathers, and Bruce Willis' self-indulgent bomb, Hudson Hawk. As a director, he tends to waste actors, and he fails to establish a consistent comic tone.

18060|1|Wang is moving toward a clearer objectivity.
27680|1|t's another enjoyable comedy of manners that seems both highly original, and, at the same time, pleasantly familiar.
12516|1|A black comedy cult classic.
20738|1|"What makes ""Out of the Past"" stand out among the film noir classics is that it has better actors, a better screenplay and it doesn't look like it was made on the cheap."
76078|0|A sleek and libidinous lingerie meller.
57984|1|The film's 149-minute running time might test the patience of even the most devout silent film fan, but the decadent costumes, elaborate sets, and Fairbanks's copious talents provide more than enough baroque pleasure to pass the time.
20308|1|Keeps the delicious nightmare fuel flowing
99400|1|"Gut wrenching performances, a well structured narrative, and a great cast makes ""An American Crime"" one of the finer movies to depict one of the most gruesome travesties of the twentieth century..."
51739|0|Presumably, the film's supposed to be a quirky and revealing slice of life - but since the central character is never developed beyond the superficial, it's impossible to care about her.
39487|0|Why was Hopkins, the best of whose films is ordinary, hired to construct a film which hangs on psychology and dialogue?
97667|1|This is Colin Farrell's best work in years and proof that Woody Allen is an old dog, and these are new tricks.

46372|1|...a powerful examination of the effects of Apartheid on a privileged white man.
12385|1|Raging Bull is a fascinating exploration of the mind of an emotionally disconnected man. It's brutal, crass and impossible to look away -- much like a real boxing match.
102269|1|But asking her to play Etta James, even packing a few extra pounds around the hips, was a mistake: she wobbles, and tries to sound husky, and the movie sags noticeably under the sense of effort.
94520|1|Seven Up scene-stealer Neil Hughes becomes the series' tragic figure in 21 Up.
38276|1|The hokum sci-fi story is good for a few cheap laughs, as it takes itself so seriously until it goes all silly and then hits us with its bleak ending.

34665|1|It's vividly animated, it's friendly -- and it's not too long.
44233|1|... one of the first and arguably the greatest of the Hollywood films to examine the pressures of command and psychological toll of making life and death decision...
83199|1|[Becker establishes] day-to-day life patterns that these characters leave behind like sludgy trails. He loads Grisbi with seedy nightclubs, after-hours restaurants, and bachelor apartments where the only on-hand food consists of stale biscuits.
8575|0|"Not to put too fine a point on it, but ""Bulletproof Monk"" is a rather large piece of garbage."

15049|1|Keitel's controlled, efficient performance makes this one worth seeing.
79254|1|Has an exciting plot and is properly atmospheric despite its cheap studio sets.
27752|1|"Maybe we should suspend the reductive question, ""Is it any good or not?"" and acknowledge that it's a fascinating, tantalising film that will continue to be argued about."
91673|1|Seven films later, with the conventions of throat croaking and neck cracking having moved into camp, it's amazing that Shimizu can still find new ways to turn the old screw.
43104|1|Some of these gags are very funny, and it's a pleasure to see Reno as something other than a villain in an English language picture.

75114|0|Desperately, aggressively, obnoxiously inept slapstick fare.
30431|1|The movie's secret strength -- its structure, really -- comes from the truth of the dozens and dozens of particular details through which it arrives at its own very hesitant, not especially comforting, very moving generality.
91879|0|What promises to be a provocative account of the late Beatle's involvement with the American underground delivers precious little in this Yoko-approved documentary.
48654|0|What's left is the framework for a graphic, brutal, sickening film, without the violent effects that might have made sense (however illegitimate) out of the conception.
36964|1|Shapes up as Chaplin's most startling, most invigorating movie: its icy temperature is positively bracing after the hot syrup of his earlier work.
26403|1|The excellent dance tunes, bountiful action and sexy young cast make this ingenious tale as tough and tasty as they come!
64108|1|It is one with which you can laugh -- with its own impudence toward foreign crises -- while laughing at its rowdy spinning jokes.
14624|1|Is it a parable about noble savages and the crushed spirits of city dwellers? That's what the film's surface seems to suggest, but I think it's also about something deeper and more elusive: The mystery of communication.
38891|0|This 1946 film is one of [Siodmak's] least interesting.
39497|0|Without Hackman, this ham-fisted psychological thriller -- based on the 1981 French movie Garde a Vue -- would be unwatchable.
67500|0|... a hurricane of melodrama and implausibly accelerating crises that seem orchestrated merely to turn up the intensity. ... At 125 minutes, [it] feels more like 240.

60516|1|[Gosling] once again shows how magnetic he can be in challenging roles.
53367|1|Filled with laughs and missed potential for lots more, the film leaves us happy but maybe wishing for something bigger.
71559|0|Offers a couple of well-filmed showdowns and lots of pretty landscapes, but you need more than scenic views and stylish action to chronicle a life, especially one as controversial as Kelly's.
51375|0|The movie's mostly a succession of predictable skits, leavened only by the occasional amusing one-liner and played by actors who aren't actors so much as just a bunch of guys goofing off.
17138|0|Loud, keening awfulness.

10365|1|Delightful English film which charts the dawning of love between two homosexuals.

86325|1|As with many modern thrillers the actual plot, once it comes to light, is highly implausible, there are a few too many turns towards the end and the climax errs towards the anti-climatic. That being said, it's well put together and entertainingly moody.

5683|0|It is what it is, and frankly I don't like it.
66804|1|Each of the characters in the film is so real, so fully drawn, that you feel you know him or her as a person, not as fiction.
42392|0|The script is stale, the acting is sub-par and misguided, and the cinematography is on par with a Turkish sitcom.
66565|1|One of the greatest of all feature debuts.
16531|1|A literate meditation on human weakness and a hipped-out horror movie all in one.
54670|1|One might relate this story to Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew. There is much to dislike in the message, but it's hard not to enjoy the craftsmanship of the tale.
93628|1|Suffice it to say that I'm a big time warp movie fan and this is a good one.
26407|1|A genuinely sweet and romantic story for teens.
17339|0|The Horse Whisperer is a calculated heart-tugging machine, as soulless and efficient in its own way as Twister or Independence Day; instead of a 'thrill-ride,' it's a trip through the tunnel of love.
89654|0|It's a pretty simple tale, but -- true to his Western influences -- Yamada slows down the action and stretches it out to a prize-winning length.
75044|1|One-of-a-kind high school comedy for the family.
2733|0|As awful as its reputation
94971|1|t's hard to imagine a better casting choice for the role of the spunky girl detective than (Emma) Roberts, who's transitioned nicely from her television role on Unfabulous to handling lead roles in teen flicks.
46234|0|The script by Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon is more clever in the small details than in the broad strokes.
7493|1|While the premise sounds more like a Charles Dickens tragedy than a comedy, it becomes a delight in such capable hands.
66249|0|The story goes by the numbers.
74214|1|Fascinating Sam Fuller film
10234|1|The great cast brings light-hearted humor and credibility to what could otherwise have been seen as a sickly exploitative (though well-written and directed) script.
37249|1|A good musical with a lot of star power.
25582|1|a wise, funny, immensely entertaining hour and a half spent with a woman of spirit and verve
13749|1|Whale's most perfectly realised movie, a delight from start to finish.
40019|1|A film so fascinatingly liberal it almost seems to exist in a different universe.
21255|1|Again you will savor the Indiana Jones schizophrenia: by day a bow-tied, bespectacled archaeologist; by night a resourceful swaggerer, whom Ford brings to life as a modern blend of Bogie and the Duke, with just a glint of misfit psychopathy in his eyes.
39498|0|Appear to have been shot by a lush and edited with a shredder.
69554|1|John Henderson's gentle World War II comedy dilutes its soft-bellied sentiment with a steady infusion of whimsy.
72627|0|Attenborough's very traditional biopic is a disappointment.
30881|1|Richard Pryor in his prime but the movie is mediocre.
17358|1|That this modest crime thriller can't quite live up to its audacious dance across so many strata of hip and hommage and self-referential cool it makes your head spin is hardly a surprise, or even a criticism.
57396|1|Scott's hilariously hateful hauteur is able to counteract some falsely fuzzy notes in the ending.
31864|1|Tour-de-force performances and one memorable storyline
53784|1|Playing a role of almost Bergmanesque intensity ... Bisset is both convincing and radiant.
14774|0|The title sounds like a bad joke - Amos & Andrew. Unfortunately, the movie is just as bad.
101564|0|While it's endearing and occasionally inspired, it's just not funny enough.
81126|1|The film does give a pretty good overall picture of the situation in Laramie following the murder of Matthew Shepard.
32720|0|The movie equivalent of a glossy, well-designed coffee table book.
81623|1|Watch this movie for its imagination, not its logic.
30918|1|Moderately successful comic-bookish horror.
84920|1|Maggie Smith and Judi Dench are a great duo, but the film isn't so great.
6805|1|As a forum for its actors and for the big-screen directorial debut of multi-Emmy winner Gregory Hoblit, the film is up to the job.
19350|1|The plot is a set-up, a stacked deck, yet the atmosphere is palpably unpleasant, and Poitier and Steiger have a field day.
40109|1|maintains a delicate balancing act between the comical tale of a boy's desire to be a ballet dancer and the backdrop of hard-edged, violent realism against which it is set
32975|1|Excellent, highly stylized animation.
15305|1|Great pace, strong dialogue, and a fun fresh angle on the life of a hit man.
81257|1|The film's an odd blend of mystery, social commentary, experimental freak-out, and all-out horror, and while the blend doesn't always work... it works well enough.
3847|1|This appealing romantic comedy catapulted the ever-likeable sandra Bullock into major stardom
61230|0|Tim Blake Nelson shows promise and has captured the essense of a small rural town, but his point isn't defined clearly enough.
94319|0|Occasional amusement aside, this is a tedious 86-minutes worth of utterly random movie.
62677|1|Uses gritty humor to polish clean the souls of a lot of likeable street people.
17200|0|A pretentious pseudo-parody of a serial-killer movie.
54200|1|This well acted ensemble melodrama is not one of John Sayles' strongest films.
27313|0|...Figgis -- one of the most interesting and meticulous directors around -- has made a genuinely boring and confusing movie.
25589|1|Mildly diverting rip-off of the far superior, Heathers.
20552|1|Young children will be unmoved by the film, but older children will enjoy it, as will adults looking for some mindless fun.
59177|1|Directors Kátia Lund and Fernando Meirelles stir all the cinematic virtues into this finely-crafted narrative.
39075|1|Keith Reddin's adaptation of his own stageplay about gun control is curiously muted. Still, there are tangible pleasures to be found, mainly in the film's delightfully off-kilter pairings.
78136|1|Few films have shown so powerfully the slashing double edge of sports fever.
88372|1|Compelling in its depiction of quiet heroism, this testament to the power of passive resistance is made all the more authentic and poignant by the superbly controlled performance of Julia Jentsch.
3351|1|Unmissable.
47146|1|A demanding film filled with complexities and meant for the discriminating viewer.
60545|1|The result is a fresh, feel-good crowd-pleaser that pokes affectionate fun at fairytale conventions while remaining true to their spirit.
8818|1|The iconic actors give memorable performances, the story is perfectly pitched and fiercely clever and under the astounding directorial eye of Alfred Hitchcock - American Cinematic God - it's nearly flawless.
41524|0|...a wholeheartedly underwhelming bit of '80s nostalgia.
58686|1|Brilliant but devastating. High schoolers and up.
83513|1|One of the finest thrillers made in England during the '50s.
17965|0|Somewhere along the line the dramatic tension evaporates.
28989|1|A psychological thriller about the dark side of having highly developed psychic abilities.
92542|1|For a series that seemed out of gas decades ago, Rocky Balboa is a knock-out.
57534|0|An exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound.
19297|1|Leonard Bernstein's rich, eloquent and demanding score is still a powerful experience.
41749|1|Totally undeserving of its status as a punchline, this may be no classic but it's a fine kiddie tale
73539|1|Devane and Jones are outstanding. Their characters are as numb as scar tissue, emasculated by peace and alienated by an ashamed and horrified society. The folly of the Vietnam War permeates every frame.
12491|0|Newman and Redford pass a few facial expressions between them and try to cool each other out. If there ever was much of a script, it can be said to have gone to waste.
46108|1|the film takes a miraculous healing turn at the end, and the characters rise above their ruefulness, and use it as a springboard into hope
40522|1|...fairly oozes with delicious irony.
40418|0|Such a departure from the book, it's not even Dr. Seuss.
33226|1|a chest-thumping source of pride for the Soviet government, full of inciting imagery, enormous filmmaking prowess and the flavor of revolution
37802|1|This is the best example of a film with awesome style but not much substance. On some levels, it's like, the coolest flick ever.
60754|1|Because the makers of King of Kings took a chance by casting heartthrob Jeffrey Hunter as Christ, this was quickly dubbed by industry wags I Was a Teenage Jesus. But the film is far better than that label would suggest.
86581|1|In unflinching terms, it captures the hellish existence endured by the many so that the few may wallow in privilege.
14299|0|As political satire, My Fellow Americans makes a poor candidate.
3290|1|Oliver Stone does an amazing job behind the camera, and the editing is totally delirious: it's one of the most visually dazzling films I've ever seen.
1744|1|Something that keeps us on our toes in Belle de Jour comes from Luis Buñuel's refusal to spell out what is real and what is not. Must this be so clear to us when the fantasy life of Séverine means so much to her?
100921|1|It has a nice message, and despite the fact that I feel he's been totally emasculated over the years, Cube remains a solid actor.
88537|1|Sometimes succeeds as genuinely new, while at other times it offers a fresh spin on its conventions. And it's always pretty agreeable.
53515|1|An intriguing tale about race, sexuality, and politics in the New London, splendidly played by Daniel day Lewis as the gay punk.
91086|0|Ultimately Angel-A never takes flight, weighted down by an overabundance of metaphysical clichés stolen from other films.
12995|1|High Noon it isn't; it's more like the darkest midnight of the American soul.
91669|0|Some films can make the leap from successful short film to a feature movie, and some just come up short.
21416|1|A stunningly accomplished chamber drama from Ingmar Bergman.
19616|1|For once, a genuinely psychological thriller.
2963|1|It's goofy and ridiculous and preposterous, and yet it makes you feel good, and there is something oddly heartwarming about the sight of this macho guy melting with feelings of protectiveness and maternal concern.
36883|1|This movie is not about plot (which is a shame because there might have been a good story to tell here), it's about fun Martial Arts action. And Mr. Chan as usual, delivers. Service with a smile.
51192|1|It seems pretty prescient about violence, corporations, and TV.
24646|1|Formulaic, manipulative, hokey — and thoroughly rousing… the film's sincerity and poignance have a way of steamrolling over gaps in plausibility and logic.
83925|0|A rule: any time you see the movie's stars racing in go-karts, it's because the script ran out of funny things to do.
28128|1|A gleaming adaptation that features three wonderful performances.
75232|0|We found it a bulky, rambling and indecisive photoplay which has not merely taken liberties with the letter of the original but with its spirit.
47290|1|Not as bad as some would make you believe. But I'm still not looking forward to that Clint Eastwood Sings Sinatra album.
20685|0|In the end, the surprisingly funny, though vulgar, energy of the first 30 minutes, is traded for distracted and unfocused vulgarity, without the inspired lampoonery.
47822|0|Though overly reliant on quick-cut montages and shots of Cassie running down hallways, writer/director Steve Carpenter delivers some modest thrills alongside the usual teen-horror clichés.
34715|1|With director Steven Soderbergh at the helm and Julia Roberts in the title role, the movie breezes by enjoyably without so much as a grandstanding speech or an awkward moment.
17525|1|It has a life of its own, thanks to Wong's over-the-top blend of John Woo-like violence and almost surreal humor.
92581|1|A great pleasure!
40257|1|A pleasantly sloppy party that doesn't go on too long.
95187|0|Antiseptic bourgeois swank
52273|0|The movie too often works against itself, pitting an increasingly implausible story with Chouraqui's hard-core realism.
63696|0|Northfork is visually stunning, thematically rich and, ultimately, about as exciting as watching an old car rust.
63126|1|At heart, HH is just a pretty good TV pilot souped up with big stars.
45170|1|Even though you won't remember significant dialogue, you are certain to retain those agonizing visuals that communicate the agony of a tortured soul.
44099|1|Sayles deftly re-creates the forces that drove men at top of their class on the diamond to take bribes: big-time crime in Chicago and heartless management in the head office.
63753|0|Another feeble 007 parody.
53537|0|...a somewhat tedious piece of work...
96534|1|10th & Wolf alternates between being bloody good and just plain bloody.
54318|1|Witty comedy of manners about the gap between the worlds of rich Americans and a lonely hotel maid in London.
45755|0|The worst of the Harry pictures, still worth watching, just for the remote control car chase.
97420|1|[Frank Langella] is a god of sorts to those who've followed his career for 30 years with an appreciation for subtle, forceful acting, and he's at the top of his game in Starting Out in the Evening.
46871|1|Jodorowsky's bold, brassy tale of psychos and circuses, Freud and fanaticism, still stirs the blood.
91506|1|Laughton's definitive performance is reason to see this elaborate costume drama.
80044|1|The action is excellent and nearly non-stop. Ogami Itto whirls the Katana and Naginata as nimbly as a marching band baton girl.
30838|1|American Movie shows what it is to be an artist obsessed with creating.
74390|1|The grotesquely caricatured performances and the evocation of the baking, dusty, indolent homestead make for witty and compelling viewing.
5119|0|I remember seeing this when first released, and I remember not liking it, but I no longer remember the film at all.
93750|1|Conventional, slight, but charming.
49063|1|Janssen and Favreau provide enjoyably consoling company for those still dating their way through life.
40922|0|Un mediano intento de sorprendernos.
87034|0|... yet another film that screams, 'Wait for the video release.'
56708|1|The problems and characters it reveals are universal and involving, and the film itself -- as well its delightful cast -- is so breezy, pretty and gifted, it really won my heart.
41899|1|Everyone knows how the battles will turn out. It`s what`s between them that raises Masters Of The Universe ever so slightly above the mediocre.
70049|1|It is among Tati's gifts that his gags are often so subtle as to threaten to get away unnoticed.
41162|1|Soderbergh uses a handheld camera to saturate the film, which he describes as Nashville meets The French Connection, with compelling, docudramatic urgency.
91570|0|There's a reason Before Sunrise and Before Sunset were done as two movies, not one.
46221|0|It's also curious to note that this film, like the similarly ill-timed Antitrust, is easily as bad at a fraction the budget.
19932|1|A bit more refined in its details than the conventional horror movie.
10408|1|A rousingly effective 'man versus beast' yarn in the great tradition of Jaws and Moby Dick.
3551|1|An instant camp classic.
25644|0|Ensemble cast drinks and flirts through lame New Year's Eve.
81658|1|Respectable but undistinguished, and it places a distant second to 2004's other award winner about euthanasia (don't ask, won't tell).
64065|1|Engrossing and unusual.
71364|0|Belies its name with its formulaic storytelling and lackluster animation.
3872|1|The film's good heart keeps it from ever making fun of Muriel, although there are moments that must have been tempting.
14313|0|It's a buddy film. It's a conspiracy thriller. It's a political parody. What it isn't is a particularly funny movie.
12986|1|"""Unforgiven"" is a high-caliber movie, a gripping and haunting work of art that should finally establish Eastwood as one of America's best directors."
54126|0|Some like it lukewarm in this tale.
73813|1|It is possible that the way to a new kind of musical -- using some of the talent and energy of what is still the most lively contemporary medium -- may begin with just this kind of musical performance documentary.
68616|1|Fellini stands on the brink, desperately grabbing at bits of his past, and boldly looking forward to a new future of decadence and garish color (this was his first in color).
16409|0|Melodramatic pap.
12314|1|Many fine feature film versions of Shakespeare exist. Few can match this one for raw power.
56519|1|A dashing hero, dastardly villain and winsome distressed damsel, not to mention a melodramatic plot, thrilling sword fights and high-spirited comedy - all the elements you need to fashion the perfect swashbuckler.
11708|1|More than 20 years after Mr. Cobb's novel was first published, Mr. Kubrick reminded us that human folly is rarely checked for long. A half-century on, he is still right.
44334|1|An encouraging sign, both for the potential of low-budget, digital video movie-making and for the potential of talented actors to bring fresh ideas to the other side of the camera.
12357|1|One of the greatest love stories of all time. Ford's direction is brilliant; O'Hara is beautiful; the cinematography is dazzling, and the brawl between Wayne and McLaglan at the finale is a comic treasure. A must-see.
53314|1|Woody Allen's latest movie, Husbands and Wives, is one of his best films and is a fascinating look at the breakup of two people.
79905|1|Taut, well-made sci-fi thriller about a massive computer.
88353|1|Surprisingly, not much has changed in the last 70 years. The tradition of sequestering widows continues in India. Mehta deserves praise for spotlighting this situation. WATER is one of the year's best films.
33890|0|Lackluster both as science-fiction and horror.
48408|0|The bottom of the barrel of disaster movies
9439|1|A real movie is big, grand, magnificent and regales you with all the power that movies can wield upon a viewer's imagination and spirit. George Stevens' 1956 production, Giant, is a real movie.
58261|0|Salivating gore with classic title.
80888|1|A fun look at Irish life; warm, loud and comical.
56559|0|What a waste of potential.
43553|0|Intriguing but ultimately irritating misfire.
91803|1|"predstavlja upravo ono %u0161to bi ""ozbiljni"" holivudski film trebao biti"
90514|1|'End of the Spear' features some intensely violent scenes, but this thought-provoking movie never falters in emphasizing the power of forgiveness.
26440|1|Amusing all the way and not something Chan fans should skip.
27181|1|[A] scary black-and-white SF effort from 1953.
16138|1|It's a great ride.
7886|0|It's sucktacular.
63458|1|Polanski directs Polanski in this creepy tale of isolation and bad real estate.
48089|1|Almost unbearably sad.
64391|0|Derivative and plain
99238|1|John Malkovich has virtually cornered the market on portraying aesthetes in the thrall of demonic visions. Klimt adds to his gallery of elegant monsters.
8239|0|Why didn't the producers save all the money they spent on these great sets and brilliant special effects for a script worthy of them?
50617|1|Smart and glossy, but it has too many sluggish moments to maintain its few high points.
97153|1|Wait until you see the end of this film! It was one of the most horrific endings I have ever seen.
23425|1|"""Holocaust comedy"" + ""life-affirming drama"" = molto hilarious dramadic cadffefmng. Perhaps cadffefmng should mean ""magical taste of realism."""
75117|1|[VIDEO ESSAY] Milius constantly revisits the ocean's churning surf as a literal and metaphoric yardstick to underscore the movie's themes of personal responsibility, loyalty, and the pressures of unpredictable social change.
89689|0|It's a shame that the film's main impetus turns out to be focused on such a pedestrian and predictable plot.
24|0|All the effects in the world can't disguise the thin plot.
80131|1|Memorable performances by Hackman and Pacino overcome a sometimes shaky script to create a touching story of a convincingly messy friendship.
21388|1|A well observed and deeply tender tale.
93101|1|The film is hardly flawless - even the pie-baking scenes sometimes seem half-baked - but it's hard not to read promise into every frame, and to wonder what Shelly might have cooked up in the future.
70614|1|Fast-moving pulp
82809|1|A predictable but pleasant kids movie.
58811|1|Danny Dyer tones down his usual swaggering cockney act and gives a genuinely sympathetic performance - his relationship with Tamar Hassan's Charlie is surprisingly touching.
67394|0|Joe Dante & Warner Brothers destroy more of our childhood memories.
73838|1|A blistering thriller and an intelligent character study and a comic take-off on the conventions of thrillers.
58348|1|Channels the themes of George Orwell and the action of John Woo wonderfully.
47657|1|Cute but not great, this Baby's still a welcome bundle of joy.
184|1|A very above par and often funny satire of a horror classic.
85867|1|...you really can't go wrong with a film that casts Gene Hackman as a sleazy villain named Mary Ann.
99988|1|Lelouch's splintered narrative, mostly related in flashback, plays games with the characters without delivering much of a payoff.
64078|0|Wilder, usually a director of considerable flair and inventiveness -- has not been able this time out to rise above a basically vulgar, as well as creatively delinquent, screenplay...
32452|1|Nearly perfect.
101463|1|"""Gomorrah"" soberly shows the low-life thugs for what they really are, resisting the convention of casting them as anti-heroes in Scorsese or Tarantino land."
29067|1|It's easy to see why Saturn 3 has achieved a certain type of cult appeal over the years- it has an incredible cast, an interesting killer robot running amok, some cool ideas, and a beautiful score by famed composer Elmer Bernstein.
97127|0|In the end, I Served the King of England is doomed to fail by comparison. Ironically, they are comparisons that the film itself keeps making.
14046|1|I very much admire how Hytner... keeps the pace swift and doesn't fetishize the 17th-century decors and clothes. But I can't help feeling that in more ways than one, The Crucible is a period piece.
55548|1|While J.D. Salinger and his Holden Caulfield positively own the territory of runaway upper class malcontents in New York, this funny and touching film does justice to the genre.
12217|1|Good John Woo movie. Over the top action scenes, and a heartfelt story about remorse.
24438|0|Not any worse than the second, but I still say this series should have ended with the first.
22971|1|Amongst the greatest British films of the post-war years.
49082|1|As pop as it is arthouse, as funny as it is tragic, Donnie Darko remains a remarkable one-off that's easy to adore.
3225|1|Miracle on 34th Street isn't great art or high comedy, but it is good entertainment.
88511|1|...the sick kind of comedy that involves laughing at stupid people being ripped in half, but we know there are plenty of you out there.
17093|1|The film does a pretty good job of both recreating the world of 17th century art and of avoiding too much historical anachronism.
8060|1|Raucously funny.
65320|0|The look, like Culkin's self-consciously manic performance, is all surface -- which may be the point of profiling these empty lives, but not enough reason to make us watch.
95359|1|Silly but funny.
9783|1|Walter Hill's Last Man Standing is an overlooked action masterpiece that perfectly blends the Western and the gangster film.
43991|1|The centerpiece is the attack. For 50 minutes, the filmmakers unleash nonstop eye candy.
84418|0|Because dark secrets always summon flashbacks, the telling of Tom's plunges us back to Greenwich Village, circa 1973. Sideburns sprout, classic rock proliferates and lapels run amok. Then the horror really begins.
44018|1|A film of unusual visual beauty and enormous intrinsic interest.
14405|1|Every actor here is top-notch, and the sense of fun and give-and-take is palpably enjoyable.
73272|0|Kind of like a whole season of Alias boiled down to a 100-minute film.
30666|1|Sean Connery is fantastic
5065|1|Plenty of drug use with very little consequence.
28231|1|With a superb lead performance from Jessica Lange, this is a horror story based on life, not nightmare.

26060|0|First-time helmer/writer Roger Kumble starts off on the right foot, but stumbles along the way.
84637|1|Smith's respect and love for the wilderness is clear in every frame, and allows the viewer to become fully immersed in the characters' predicaments.
58937|1|Excellent account of FBI's youngest Most Wanted.
89757|1|X-Men: The Last Stand is far from perfect, but it does manage to move in the direction of a crowd-pleasing thrill ride without completely lobotomizing itself.
68357|1|Dalle, a model, makes a moving debut as the desperate baby-doll who fails to mold reality to her own conceptions of happiness. Anglade is more introvertedly affecting as the lucidly casual, but devoted Zorg.
66327|1|In Klimov's unshakable vision, death is casual, safety is impossible and beauty is backwards: this is peerlessly gorgeous filmmaking about absolute ugliness.
4713|1|This sequel to the 1990 picture contains some funny scenes and witty one-liners.
51577|1|Michael Rymer stages high-tech sequences combining gore, romance, and gothy music, and he has enough conviction to make what could have been very silly strangely provocative.
76561|1|Nobody ever talks about the underrated Goodbye, Columbus, but they should.
96812|0|The success of those sequences only underline how good the film might have been if it wasn't so busy trying to be cute.
86467|1|The story is interesting, in a twisted fairytale sort of way, but the novelty of this dream world does eventually wear off, and we're left checking our watches.
54485|0|Part comedy, part drama, the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full, and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas, but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole.
96400|0|Calamitous
96293|0|I don't know what planet the people who put this together live on, but the behavior depicted here has nothing to do with anything recognizable as human, let alone normal.
63786|1|Although Steve Knight's Oscar-nominated script gets a bit on the nose discussing those who pretty that which we dirty, it tells a compelling tale of perseverance, with a final sound effect like hope gaining altitude.
67514|1|Humour, whether darkly observant or skilfully witty, twines through the film like a confidently creeping ivy, growing out of the characters quite naturally.
31826|1|Like many entries into the genre, Jagged Edge works best when it's watched with a minimum of analysis.
78830|1|There's an intrinsic emotional pull to this earnest tale of parents in search of a child.
51098|0|The movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny Phonce and his several silly subplots.
70237|1|Ultra-violent action from Japan's leading cult director that plays fast and loose with genre conventions to deliver an innovative -- and frequently revolting -- work of cult Asian cinema.
30669|1|City Lights is a paean to our best impulses, a plea for humanitarianism and justice.
17620|0|A thriller driven by considerable suspense before taking a wrong exit somewhere near the end.
56522|1|Sometimes, nothing satisfies like old-fashioned swashbuckling. And in this regard, On Guard delivers.
18944|1|Aronofsky, who has parlayed this movie's Sundance success into two Hollywood deals, is that rare indie filmmaker who doesn't want to make hip romantic sitcoms. He's a genuine experimenter with a spooky visual style.
48838|1|With each musical number, another integral and eternal aspect of Judaism is pondered, explored, and expressed with passionate flourishes.
15277|0|At its best, it refuses to take itself seriously and literally winks at us. But more often, it derives laughs unintentionally.
60251|1|Brimming with smart ideas - not to mention a stellar turn from Bowie - but roughly-hewn and completely excessive.
88036|0|A little too emotionally repressed to suit its melodrama -- imagine Casablanca with Paul Henried miscast in the Bogart role.
80490|0|Everyone tries hard, but the movie is essentially superficial and has difficulty sustaining audience interest.
96500|1|for those who would rather step on a tack than sit through another Miracle, this film is a long overdue revival to the spoof genre.
30977|0|Atrociously written by actor Ebbe Roe Smith and atrociously directed (it goes without saying) by Joel Schumacher...
21151|0|Then Michael shows up and blah blah blah.
597|0|What emerges is an uneasy blend of didacticism and juiced-up bloodletting (the brothers don't know when to stop with the exploding squibs) that bury the film's message and its good intentions.
94036|0|It's not the diversion from source material that bothers me; it's the way in which the diversions are bland, listless, annoyingly familiar, and patently unengaging.
91676|0|...nothing more than a needless rehash of its predecessor...
50861|0|The last reel or so is an embarrassment -- or entertainment at long last, depending on how you look at it.
19788|0|There's little doubt that Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter marks the nadir of the series up to this point...
16422|1|Beautifully nuanced, passionately performed, and terrifically realized piece of work.
27178|1|Among top five of 1950s sci-fi classics, starring great effects along with Richard Carlson.
11390|1|Another aching heartbreaker of a film by Berri that absorbs and rewards the audience for sticking with Manon on her sun-beaten quest.
48432|1|Hicks' film is a beautiful trifle, a neat trick of light and sound to coax empathy
39107|1|The direction is deliberate, but the attention to detail is impressive, and the perfromances of Jean Arthur, Alan Ladd, and Brandon De Wilde are so good and restrained that they overcome the social-mythical types they're playing.
9202|1|A fun seaside frolic, but doesn't sit long in the mind.
65111|0|...the whole thing has a been-there-done-that feeling to it.
62915|1|Though debatable as an adaptation of the Franz Kafka novel, Orson Welles's nightmarish, labyrinthine comedy of 1962 remains his creepiest and most disturbing work; it's also a lot more influential than people usually admit.
87948|0|Rumor has it that Rob Reiner used to make really funny, often moving films. I have no doubt he will do so again.
82942|1|Suspenseful, surprising, and psychologically rich.
90|1|Heat becomes consistently more interesting as it forges on toward the 180-minute mark.
9664|0|Além de trazer aquela que é provavelmente a pior cena dirigida por Capra em sua carreira (o monólogo de Regis Toomey na prefeitura), o filme é um água com açúcar repleto de diálogos patriotas/cristãos patéticos, artificiais e piegas.
51254|1|In this well-crafted movie, a strong cohesive ensemble makes the team likable. Guiry as Scotty is especially good.
70949|0|If I were a Christian, I'd be appalled to have this primitive and pornographic bloodbath presume to speak for me.
49654|0|You will find more frights in Finding Nemo. And you might just have more fun playing with your lollie wrappers, performing shadow puppets on the screen - or even picking your nose - than enduring this dimly lit horror movie.
6229|1|Medium-funny culture clash humor contrasting California with the rural south.
39715|1|Well-constructed and satisfyingly low
17229|1|A film that touches on the essence of love by throwing us into the abyss of loss, The Sweet Hereafter marks the apex of the English-Canadian film tradition as it navigates the empty space left in the wake of tragedy with a gentle, but unsentimental eye.
95611|1|Initially complex, the piece's grip loosens with the introduction of a transparent villain, but it remains an entertaining thriller bolstered by Cluzet's appropriately angst-driven performance.
48632|1|This is an Oscar-calibre performance from Angelina Jolie. She conveys a sense of grief, desperation, fear, sadness and determination that is absolutely palpable.
47670|1|This movie has a lot of heart and soul into it.
19538|1|One of the most provocative and stunningly beautiful films of the past 20 years.
73273|1|Northam is perfectly cast - with every swill of scotch he transforms from shy and retiring to the debonair sophisticate he has always wanted to be.
81376|1|What makes [it] so effective is Tian's very carefully wrought visual style and the performances of his tiny cast.
12692|1|Pays homage to the crime novels of Dashiell Hammett.
5747|0|"""North""? This movie sinks due south, deep into ground oblivion."
92234|0|Consider this one disarmed and extremely pointless.
25586|0|The only good thing about Jawbreaker is The Donnas. They rock.
94954|0|Yet another preposterous penguin animation.
35716|1|An irresistible double act from Lemmon and Matthau.
83646|0|A half-hearted, loosey-goosey sequel so floppy and laid-back that it just sort of lounges on a sun chair and soaks up the audience's good intentions.
74836|1|It's one of those very difficult exercises in which large emotions, like the compulsion to be free, are reflected in minute actions, like the chipping away at stone with a pocket nail clipper.
37049|0|An ill-conceived and frankly quite silly Bond-meets-sci-fi experiment.
32400|0|The seamless integration of the CG animal characters with real-life ones and the general storybook look of the film remains impressive, but this being the second go-round it's that less dazzling; ditto for Nathan Lane's amusing wisecracks.
47709|1|It's highly enjoyable and well acted, with the Iago figure better motivated than in the original play, no single line of which has been retained except for the odd echo.
455|1|Jeunet and Caro have distinctive signatures like nobody else's.
72556|1|Le Samouraï's narrative players are designed for easy interpretation. This fosters the plot's complication, as well as Melville's inimitably stylistic filmmaking
90261|0|Just looking at the genre, this is a cut above the normal. This is by no means an endorsement of this movie, but it is better than most.
27042|0|"The cut-rate production resulted in what Reeve termed ""catastrophe"" for a film intended to marry a serious message to the series' signature action, humor, and romance."
91956|1|It positively crackles with energy, featuring startlingly raw performances from a cast that also includes Shia LaBeouf as the young Dito. And if it looks ragged around the edges, that's as it should be.
20428|0|The Rapture at first plays like a religious propaganda film and later a misconceived parable with bad special effects
52178|1|Does the title refer to the plot device or the final cut?
72536|1|Thanks to Hepburn's performance we can feel how this woman's past romantic disappointments have made a passionate affair seem so simultaneously appealing and frightening.
45970|1|Dreyfuss at his usual, amusing best
37666|0|Devices meant to keep Shakespeare user-friendly instead reduce the story to a jumble.
33237|1|Propaganda that transcends its own numbskull earnestness... When it connects, it's as poweful as anything you've ever seen.
36029|1|One can picture Kubrick handling this material with a similar elegant malevolence.
60312|0|Promises an intelligent debate about capital punishment but delivers a predictable thriller, directed with stunning amateurishness by Alan Parker.
24792|1|The true story of a Virginia medical student who breaks all the rules by daring to proclaim that the best medicine for patients is love, laughter and play.
61555|1|An entertaining fluffy popcorn comedy with plenty of eye candy for the guys and gals.
54832|1|The story has almost no momentum and runs out of gas, ending abruptly, but how can you knock a movie with so many gut-busting jokes?
32936|0|"Watching ""Loaded Weapon 1"" is like playing Trivial Pursuit with experts. It's exhausting."
81343|0|Far from fleshing out the universe of THE MATRIX, this cynical, self-indulgent marketing tie-in renders it less coherent. Boasts only a few memorable visual moments, and suffers from a paucity of narrative.
15831|1|Uma ficção científica que confere peso semelhante aos dois termos do gênero: se sua narrativa ficcional é intrigante e bem desenvolvida, sua ciência jamais se entrega ao implausível.

43040|1|Representa una buena oportunidad de esparcimiento y evasión
3404|1|Quiz Show' is a uniquely American tragedy, told with subtlety and complexity.
8068|0|My fondest memory involving Fled isn't in the film; it was the moment on Siskel & Ebert when Roger Ebert stated, 'I guess it sort of holds your attention while it's happening. I mean, something is moving on the screen, so you look to see what it is.'
63511|0|This is just embarrassing, a simply and utterly embarrassing attempt to market money from a charming film.
90824|1|In all their messiness, here are love, sex, society, and family, met with cleansing laughter.
7008|0|A music box trying to pass itself off as an orchestra.
61629|1|If you're looking for something artistic and brilliantly conceived, I suggest you search elsewhere. But there's something to be said for a straight sitcom flick that delivers the laughs.
91617|0|Running With Scissors has a great cast and an appropriately chaotic nature, but it never really adds up to anything and fails to hit its emotional targets.
6254|1|Axe is not art by any means. It's often overly taken up with resolving itself. But Myers and others create an enjoyably loose, anti-slick feeling about the affair.
97914|1|The plot is paper thin (something about an ancient battle between humans and mythical creatures and a goblin-built clockwork) but Guillermo del Toro's talent has always been to create worlds and bring creatures to life.
99301|0|Redbelt, his latest, is a curious one, a movie that hints at greatness only to retreat, unpardonably, into genre convention.
92338|0|Ayer's overly flashy direction epitomizes how the film never finds the right balance between too much and too little.
86206|1|The film may find a niche and raise interest from those of both sides of the political spectrum.
102288|1|If you love movies, this is a must-see.
26858|1|"""Black Mask"" (Hak hap) is an all-out non-stop Hong Kong action film that is better than most films of the martial arts genre."
26419|1|Thanks to Barrymore's goodhearted presence, Josie's comic emotional journey has plenty of mass appeal.
40741|1|Typical jingoistic Stone bullroar, but professional.
44343|1|Despite the somewhat overused plot device, it manages to avoid most of the usual cliches.
10980|0|The movie is at its stunning best as it comes to terms with the impact of its own most devious surprise... Still, at a certain point, it reverts to formula.
5602|1|Russell plays this role very well, relying more on his intellectual image than muscles in the same manner as his character who uses more brain and less physical power to achieve his task.
75987|0|As ótimas seqüências de perseguição e as duas ou três boas piadas não são o bastante para equilibrar o fraco roteiro e as péssimas vilãs (especialmente Bündchen, pavorosa).
92021|1|An intelligent thriller that effectively conveys the message that terrorism, even in apartheid-era South Africa, is rarely a black-and-white issue.
85700|0|Posin aims for are out of his reach and he's left to scrabble desperately for a story to plug in the gaps.
83270|0|A lot of chore for a tiny bit of reward.
89434|1|This franchise will never make the history books, but, you know, if they have to keep coming, this is probably the best of the lot, with more laughs than you might expect.
70468|1|It's a winning, heartfelt and conflicted piece where the conflicts often resolve themselves in surprising ways.
28789|0|It's the kind of summer movie you see only if a power failure has knocked out your air conditioning.
39137|1|The picture isn't as consistently funny as its reputation would suggest, but Marvin is terrific.
56329|1|A witty, trenchant, wildly unsentimental but flawed look at the ins and outs of modern moviemaking.
90119|1|Chris Paine has painted a convincing picture of corporate greed -- working hand in hand with the government.
62082|0|This film felt more like a Canadian 'TV Movie of the Week' than anything.
65942|1|It's the balance of ethnic humor, melodrama and simple charms that make Mambo Italiano, while not something too special, a solid choice for those who enjoy Greek Wedding and its other recent spinoffs.
63956|1|It's not perfect (it's a sequel after all), but the latest Lara Croft film is smart, sexy and great summer fun.
38907|0|I guess you had to be there.
43484|0|One Night at McCool's is too high-brow to be low-rent and too low-brow to be considered worthy.
4321|1|Watching The Paper got me in touch all over again with how good it feels to work at the top of your form, on a story you believe in, on deadline.
70626|0|Ocean's Thirteen is one long set-up for a wholly unsatisfying and impotent climax.
88175|0|The fight scenes are the worst kind of editing-room cheating, meant to cover for actors who haven't been trained to wield anything more intimidating than a cell phone.
5631|1|At best it's a thinking person's XXX flick; at worst it's as repetitive as a porn video.
58798|0|A sluggish courtroom melodrama relieved only by unintenional laughter.
41827|1|A Beautifully Told Comedy/Adventure by Joe Dante. My personal favorite of his.
74236|1|An alternately fascinating and repellent digital video documentary.
36891|1|Wilson is the glue that holds the story together, and propels Shanghai Noon to the same stature held by Rush Hour.
5692|1|"Williams has to break out of a second-rate ""Tootsie"" imitation, ankles clamped in pathos and face covered in latex. He pulls it off in the end, but it's not pretty."
28708|0|Barely distinguishable from other recent mob flicks like Analyze This.
54817|1|Kurosawa somehow manages to imbue every moment of this three-hour-plus movie with the transcendent vitality and intelligence of a great Victorian novel.
100290|1|Heralding a return to form for Eddie Murphy, this cleverly conceived and executed sci-fi comedy offers plenty of laughs for all ages. The considerable challenge for the filmmakers was to streamline three realities and make each one credible.
45252|1|Engaging, at times vicious drama w/Lancaster as acidic gossip monger, Curtis fine as wimpy sidekick.
85044|1|The dance these filmmakers have created is the sort that makes viewing a joy.
75548|1|Rather than ride the easy cynicism of the script, by Michael Tolkin and Henry Bean, Fishburne illuminates his character's moral struggle.
31694|1|The Grapes of Wrath is Hollywood's most distinguished offering.
66206|1|A lyrical, exciting adrenaline rush.
45077|1|Everyone can find something they like on the buffet.
39278|0|...do not under any circumstances rent this if you've never seen the Highlander TV series.
7965|1|Flawed story, but compelling story does hook one.
6342|1|...a pulpy good time that holds up remarkably well two decades after its theatrical release...
63746|0|Imagine Sixteen Candles as re-written by Britney Spears or Ghost World as re-written by Lizzie McGuire.
6049|1|Profoundly moving, profoundly shocking, profoundly important.
59153|0|'Overall, what more can you say about this two-bit meandering and empty-headed carousing crime comedy? Bottom line: everyone connected with this project ought to be handcuffed to the door handle of a speedy out-of-control police cruiser.'
11660|1|Eventually, Delicatessen descends into raw grotesquerie and excess. But first, it serves as an ample experimental field and proving ground for a wild talent that's thankfully become more disciplined with time.
21552|1|Immerses us in a familiar yet utterly unique world that's deeper, wider and more vibrantly alive than any mere puppetry.
47473|0|A romance as spectacular as this novel is, it still has a difficult job making the leap to the screen.
60886|1|As harmlessly entertaining as it is, this journey is a few screams and gasps short of a real 3D thrill ride.
93576|1|Spoilt, rich, posh, vacuous and fame-obsessed - who better to play Edie Sedgwick? If she's acting or not, Miller is brilliant. Just a shame the film is so shallow too.
58374|0|Perry knows what his fans want (that would be Madea) and so his fans should be well-pleased by his latest film.
96605|1|There's very little that's whimsical about this coming-of-age chronicle, but if we're looking for political reflection we're reading the wrong comic book.
10659|1|...filled with good humor, good acting, and good songs...and it's just off kilter enough to keep everyone's attention.
63295|1|The dreamy flow back and forth through time and memory and the shifting point of view across four narrators casts the sleek stylistics of 21st-century Hong Kong cinema between tortured existential heroics and tall tale.
1224|0|Curiously forgettable.
98386|1|A movie in which acting still prevails is Mongol. People often say, 'They don't make movies like they used to.' Maybe the Russians make movies like Hollywood used to. Mongol, photographed beautifully in Kazakhstan and the Chinese province of
8836|1|The great suspense director was at his most entertaining, creating a helter skelter action film where the hero is propelled from one breathless situation to the next.
18530|1|Wild, unflinching, and aggressively un-P.C. black comedy.
99038|0|I wonder if all this worked better as a book. It begins modestly interesting, but becomes merely agitated.
51005|0|A film with a great premise but only a great premise.
1414|1|Wong made Chungking in just 23 days, and the film's mad-dash energy is nicely reflected in his quartet of stars. Wong, himself a star of cinema's future, has already shown that he possesses a uniquely '90s voice, eye and spirit.
34901|0|Even though the melodrama gets ratcheted up at the end, there were plenty of moments I found myself cheering for the Champ.
46237|1|A totally excellent film.
56394|1|Lathan and Diggs have considerable personal charm, and their screen rapport makes the old story seem new.
95274|0|Writer-director Jeremy Brock has backloaded much of the hero's family conflict into the final scenes, which collapse under the weight.
29361|0|There's a by-the-numbers feel to much of the action.
70070|1|the retro feel that the passing decades have bestowed upon it may make it even more enjoyable today than it was in 1953.
10302|1|Nick Cassavetes' first feature celebrates the acting grandeur of his mom Gena Rowlands, casting her in the lead role as a older woman who would rather stick to her independent lifestyle than be dependent on her kids; I wish the script were better.
66952|0|It all becomes little more than feel-good-about- feeling-bad window dressing, like an issue of Utne Reader in Dolby Surround Sound.
30331|1|Marvels abound in this honest and engaging film about real people from the heartland of America.
24876|1|One wonders why Dafoe is even in the movie. But Nolte is, and that's what enriches Schrader's bleak drama.
3135|1|[Hawthorne] turns what would surely be an unsympathetic role in lesser hands into something poetic -- and hysterical.
65983|1|Thematically, it connects easily with most other titles in the Cronenberg oeuvre, with the added treat of having been released far ahead of its time.
35507|1|Good clean fun, that will keep kids (and most adults) absorbed in its shiny cartoon bubble throughout.
56319|1|Those looking for a light and decidedly untraditional comedy will find some smart and witty exchanges within; those who consider Adam Sandler an underrated genius may be bored stiff.
102470|1|...packs one hell of an emotional punch as it approaches its affecting and flat-out devastating conclusion.
44094|1|The tone of Eight Men Out is reminiscent of the droll irony of John Huston's considerations of the vanity of human wishes and the corrupting power of money.
49287|1|When the final act descends into preachiness, it's nearly earned the indulgence.
1455|0|A dreary, ultimately punishing adaptation of Frank McCourt's memoir, where every other scene has somebody either getting sick, puking or dying.
95311|0|'Across the Universe' is whimsical silliness, imaginatively constructed but precious and gratingly excessive.
58539|0|So routine that just about everyone involved looks bored.
60841|1|While in every other Holocaust film the Nazis are depicted as masterful at sniffing out and executing Jews, Perel dodges bullet after bullet with relative ease and immense good fortune.
36492|0|Gladiator is a remarkable spectacle of unforgivable length.
68949|0|Has no real taste of its own, but, in its mildness and predictability, offers the reassurance of a fast-food or motel chain.
100322|1|If poetry is about finding the perfect words to say something, then movie poetry is about finding perfect images. And Water Lilies has several of them.
66549|1|There is so much going on here, that the film's total lack of subtext - or, more generously, its pure escapism - only sinks in afterwards. It may be a tale of sound and fury, signifying nothing - but all that demon-whupping sure is fun.
12300|1|Visually poetic, darkly humorous, uncompromisingly brutal, and subversive in every way, Full Metal Jacket is easily one of the best war movies without being remotely similar to your standard issue war flick.
94331|0|Reaser really doesn't stand a chance. She's plucky as heck, and you like her despite the script, but she can't save the movie.
28970|0|Ludicrous plot and even worse dialogue!
77495|0|Fans of the games will have fun spotting the Easter eggs on display, but precious little else. Indeed, the chief horror here is the cliffhanger promising a third instalment.
9699|1|From bumbling infants to majestic adults, a flock hasn't been this charismatic onscreen since Hitchcock went bird-watching.
35229|1|It tells with sophisticated simplicity a not so simple story of faith and unconditional love and the sadness that comes to one who falls short in both.
87769|0|The screenplay was lacking, the characters not engaging, the story dragged on and no real insights on being a geisha. Paul Chambers, CNN.
36566|0|Alternately dreary and fascinating.
11866|1|"One emerges from this film not only with a new vocabulary and a fresh way of viewing the straight world but with a bracing object lesson in understanding what society ""role models"" are all about."
98111|1|Not entirely successful, but worth a look.
98235|1|An all in the dysfunctional family royal romp with incestuous tendencies, this richly textured, dramatically disciplined, erotically laced and emotionally taut creation makes for weirdly kinky historical analysis, but pretty steamy pre-tabloid melodrama.
100493|0|There is also a general sloppiness to the screenplay, which introduces elements that have no real pay-off.
28070|0|The miscast and downright miserable company attempts zaniness against the exotic South American backdrop.
52142|1|The movie is slapsticky and obvious, but it includes one genuinely nightmarish concept: Vincent and Ida cultivate a secret garden of moaning and gurgling burlap sacks -- bags that cover the heads of the couple's buried-to-the-neck victims.
79664|1|Davis drifts fantastically between lucidity and insanity, creating a character who is both ominously frightening and pitiable.
7607|1|At its best, Force achieves a style at once brutal and poetic, documentarian and noir.
92878|1|Deftly navigating the line between the sublime and the saccharine ...
37671|0|It's never hugely engaging and it's instantly forgettable, but it has a certain goofy charm...
13464|1|The movie is too conventional and fictionalized to qualify as a genuine political epic, but it's emotionally touching in describing the friendship between the NY Times reporter and his Cambodian translator.
36424|0|This is as irritating as chick flicks come and it's a real disappointment since Portman's talents are totally wasted.
73996|0|Though rife with worthy intentions and great notions, this populist safari manages to be both patronizing and manipulative.
73928|1|A monolith of lowbrow entertainment from the days when cheap movies could be made and marketed cheaply.
101891|0|A typically underwhelming post-Apatow comedy...
56009|0|This is Jackie Pants not Jackie Chan.
47661|1|This one's all labor pains, and, in the end, nothing gets delivered.
22833|1|Much of the best dialogue, you suspect, was improvised by Tucker and Chan, who seem truly taken with each other and make a delightful, ordinary-extraordinary pair.
37381|1|This is the most bizarre comedy in many a month, a movie so dark, so cynical and so funny that perhaps only Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner could have kept straight faces during the love scenes.
98575|1|A gentle period piece that will look more comfortable on the small screen.
66349|1|Bill Duke's Harlem has the heft of an imaginatively heightened reality; it's a great place to visit.
72916|1|Captures the spirit and joy of growing up on cheesy old horror movies. One of the best pieces of nostalgia ever made.
48670|0|Rafkoff é o típico cineasta que se orgulha de ser picareta: além de ser incapaz de criar um único plano razoável, ele ainda rouba imagens de outras produções, provando ser discípulo fiel de Ed Wood.
37296|0|Is public indifference to the circumstances that produce these dead-end expectations fueled as much by the hopelessness depicted in well-meaning documentaries like 'Baraka' as by violent gangsta rap narratives and cliched boyz-n-the-hood movies?
20315|1|Fair is fair, so it really isn't a Christmas movie, but it'd take an outright Scrooge to complain about that.
53603|1|It's the last 20 minutes that save the film from too much visual information (though it is state-of-the-art awesome) and too much exposition (without the humor that made episodes IV-VI three of the best films ever made).
11718|1|Stanley Kubrick's best meditation on war (yes, Full Metal Jacket fans, you heard me).
99079|1|Fans of either martial artist will probably find enough to enjoy out of this, and will even like it more if they like 80's fantasy films.
604|0|The movie makes its point, and continues to hit you over the head with it.
54939|0|Broomfield's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all, and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient.
80971|1|Though a bit long and occasionally awkward, this drama ultimately does justice to its inspiration.
56214|1|This is a great robbery farce enforced by excellent writing and great acting from a stellar cast.
100818|1|The action movie has been spoofing itself for years. Half of the time it's no even intentional. Ben Stiller's hilarious and surprisingly intelligent Tropic Thunder takes the genre spoof to a new extreme.
67564|1|It might just make a few hardhearted cynics feel a warm fuzzy for the holidays.
88379|1|The film holds few surprises, though it builds a remarkable level of suspense during the fait-accompli interrogation scenes, and is a well-intended commemoration of a courageous young woman.
16243|1|A solid, muscular thriller that manages to deliver big action set-pieces without insulting the audience's intelligence.
24505|1|While cruder than the first film, Rocky II successfully drives its hero back to the underdog status needed to make the final fight as exciting and satisfying as it is.
24490|1|Although Rocky II builds itself around a rematch between Rocky and Apollo, the movie is anything but a lazy sequel.
97840|0|When the comedy revolution comes, Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer will be the first ones shot.
78614|1|An overview of an intensely passionate life as few film-makers could bring it to the screen.

17137|0|Bring back Fred MacMurray ... a hyper, witless snooze.
101746|0|Real no frills filmmaking. Anything that gets in the way of the main idea is stripped to the bone. This includes certain niceties like character, humor, and even story.

74944|0|"""Saved!"" starts out as a feisty satire on organized religion but sputters in its third act to an apologetic footnote for all that has come before."
68982|0|One wonders how someone can do so many parodies as Aykroyd has and still not have the slightest idea of how to do a parody.
99650|1|Loony Toons slapstick madness combines with martial arts spectacle to give way to some wonderfully funny scenes.
95616|1|An absorbing thriller, one that works its narrative complications over a genuinely moving emotional foundation and is spiked with just enough dark humor to keep it from becoming overly serious.
102068|0|There are enough ponderous moments that you may find yourself resisting the heavy mood.
58744|1|The drumbeat behind the Thornberrys' energetic exploits may not be as explosive as its celebrated Disney counterpart The Lion King, but it certainly gives off a similar rhythmic radiance nevertheless.
33000|1|Try to locate a narrative, and the whole thing dissolves; better to take the lead of Heidrum Kussin's buxom, straitjacketed Reinfeld, who emerges from the reverie bewildered and aroused.

58285|1|This amazing film is devastatingly accurate in its depiction of the Rorke's Drift action, and is superbly directed by Cy Endfield, whose battle scenes are some of the most terrifying ever committed to film.

41427|1|The film is dated, but its mixed message -- and its potential to offend virtually everyone -- still makes it a powerful discussion starter.
68925|1|Looking for Mr. Goodbar is very much worth seeing, particularly for the Diane Keaton performance.
71767|0|Gershon is the only reason to watch the film.

43086|1|The story here is intriguing, but there is something hinted at in between the plot that really struck me.
64984|1|A fascinating, comprehensive and disturbing film-fortified by Maryse Alberti`s striking photography of the ruggedly beautiful land-that is both exhaustive and exhausting.
65080|0|The film sheds weak satirical light on the issues of freedom of speech, media responsibility, and oppression of minorities. It's anybody's guess who the target audience could be.

35301|1|Paul Newman established himself as a superstar in this uncompromising antihero role.
8472|1|Although the movie contains occasional moments of glimpsed accomplishment, Kansas City is for the most part a lame duck.
75026|1|No stranger to the bizarro social metaphor, [Kurosawa] somehow paints the film's title as honestly optimistic, winkingly ironic, and completely doom-laden at the same time.
45542|0|"Should Disney continue with other straight-to-DVD sequels or prequels like this one, ""Bambi II""....needs to be required viewing. A close relationship between characters, as with Bambi and his father, works. An insufferable Flounder does not."
61322|0|It's as if this is a rough cut and [Vin] Diesel didn't show up for the reshoots.
49491|0|[Across 110th Street] is well-made, realistic in presentation and effect with uniformly good portrayals from actors, but depressingly lacking in a sympathetic focal point for audiences to grasp.
100990|0|When we should be feeling fascinated by the unfolding mystery and creeped out by things acting up nastily, we instead find ourselves thinking too much and asking questions.
74009|1|Um terror bem construído que não quer apenas provocar sustos passageiros, mas sim estabelecer um clima de tensão constante e personagens com os quais realmente nos importemos.
27842|1|Even the special effects are more to the point of the comedy than they were in the first film. For some reason, this appears to leave more room for the sort of random funny business that Mr. Murray and his friends do best.
81855|1|Striking, superbly crafted feature debut by Jacob Estes
18918|1|Small Soldiers deserves to be re-evaluated, which fortunately also means that it can finally be enjoyed, too.

70052|1|A hard-edged satire that is both funny and beautiful, entertaining and thought-provoking.
86803|1|"By its end, ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" evolves into a prophetic vision of how television and film can be used to illuminate or insulate, educate or entertain."
55618|1|The resulting bloodbath, both nasty and hilarious, is a master class in the art of the remake, wavering somewhere between respectful reimagining and gleeful pastiche.
94239|0|More than two decades ago, Forman gave us Amadeus, a portrait of the historical artist that both captured a time and made its people seem real and recognizable. On that second point, the new film falls far short.
74110|1|Although it was underrated at the time of its release, time will eventually reveal that Hamburger Hill is one of the best and most realistic films made about the Vietnam War.
7462|0|Multiplicity exists because it's now possible for an actor to appear on screen with himself and not by means of anything so quaint as double exposure.
90169|1|Material is uneven, but rhythm and pacing keep action moving smartly.
65260|0|In the end, Meadows' film lacks the bite it needs to make us care about this oddball trio, endearing though they are.

84452|1|A cut above the usual rubbish, thanks to a smart script, some gorgeous photography and the chemistry between its two leads
88056|0|The shoddy script and train wreck of a supporting cast don't do much to win us over.

40811|1|A charming romantic fantasy with delicious performances by the entire cast.
56264|1|Good biopic of Lou Gehrig. Splendid Gary Cooper performance.
30626|1|There are some splendid action sequences, notably a speedboat leap that set a new world record, as well as the usual array of hi-tech gadgetry.
9021|1|A concentration of classic filmmaking at its peak, a specimen of director Billy Wilder at the razor's edge of his brilliance.
60269|1|Once upon a time in Los Angeles, the air was dirty and the cops were clean. The only reason to see this movie is to see Kurt Russell again prove his consistency. Too bad there aren't Oscars for the Cal Ripken's of Hollywood.

90067|0|"What probably should have been an R-rated movie, ala ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin,"" comes off as a half-hearted attempt at poking laughs with unlikable characters."
75449|1|By standrads of the 1950s, this is a passably entertaining period adventure, representing Hollywood's effort to fight the competition from the new and threatening medium of TV.

2274|0|...despite its rampant sexual material, it is not a sexy film. Dang, this thing couldn't get anything right.
7322|1|It's a sad movie, no question -- but like most great drama, it inspires admiration for its thoughtfulness and its craft.
30900|0|Michael Crichton's slow-paced thriller must have begun with something to say about the morality of the medical profession, but whatever it was is lost in the shuffle of unnecessary narrative detail.
72887|0|In the end, you want a good movie with message about ecology and how to preserve human nature? Forget it; go to a Green peace conference.
65665|0|Okay, worms: not scary. At all.
10201|1|Disney was and is a studio with an impenetrably inflated sense of quality control.
92311|1|Weaver makes Linda her own, alternating between off-putting brashness, engaging honesty and bursts of spontaneous, childlike behavior.
33474|1|Snipes and Harrelson make a winning team, even if their partnership doesn't quite stand up to comparison with Eastwood and Wallach in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, or Redford and Newman in The Sting.
5978|1|With a tighter pace and a few more 'kicks' this one would be a true cult favourite.
70103|1|[Bogey & Bacall's] onscreen chemistry is palpable, all but overshadowing the fictional back story that made Rick and Ilsa's dance in Casablanca so memorable.

20210|1|It's quite an amusing movie.

41510|0|As amazingly bad as it is audacious, film will live forever in the hearts of connoisseurs of Hollywood's most memorably outrageous moments.
34042|0|To give you an idea of the level of comedy here, Fargas has fewer lines than farts, playing a flatulent uncle.
59200|1|The pathetic, social-climbing heroine of Booth Tarkington's novel was never better played than by Hepburn, who brought a fierce determination, clutching coyness, and tragic optimism to the part.
54382|0|Sadly, the movie has no new ideas worth mentioning.
86787|0|Orlando Bloom gives a typically abysmal performance as a man-boy who doesn't know if he's old enough to shave yet.
34753|1|Refreshing!
55814|0|...a tragic misuse of two presumably talented women.
30941|0|Because Re-Animator is so poorly acted and directed (by Stuart Gordon, whose first film this is), there is no tension to break. So the gruesome scenes are just clinical and dull.
65912|1|An entertaining, well-crafted primer on one of the most important Christian leaders since Jesus Christ.

27226|1|masterfully entertaining film on a limited budget
10205|1|Sweet but a bit dull...Overall, the picture is good-hearted and colorful, with an ending that carries a nice touch of ambiguity about the tussle of nature and nurture. [Blu-ray]
1174|0|An ambitious but unsatisfying meditation on the morality of power.
64530|1|Whimsical irony is matched with arresting visuals throughout Carnage, and those moments carry the day even if you don't buy Gleize's everything-is-connected bull.
76634|0|For the first hour and fifteen minutes of the movie, we make only limited excursions out of the tenement, and it begins to feel as though we've moved in ourselves. Kurosawa may have intended this, but it doesn't make for very satisfying viewing.
56304|1|The film celebrates stupidity and would likely have caused an international incident if Canadians weren't so nice, but it essentially lives up to its premise, once in a while coming up with a gag that is halfway funny.
22425|1|Oh boy, this one is creepy. Creepy like a single, leaden knock on your front door when you're home all alone and it's 2:30 in the morning and it's October, and you're not expecting anyone and then the doorknob turns. Creepy like that.
40782|0|Of the ensemble, only Pitt truly shows his class, delivering an amusing yet emotive performance amongst a group of actors who -- at best -- are pandering to laddish culture.
33590|0|Slightly disturbing, slightly more boring.
40666|0|If She's Having a Baby were a funnier movie, if the fights were more cleverly written and Bacon and McGovern played them more deftly and lightly, it wouldn't have that unpleasant edge -- seesawing between romance and paranoia.
59785|1|Lyricism, poetry, brutality, reality, fantasy; mixed and slowly stirred, make for a special mood
48214|1|If it begins deceptively, as though setting out to be your typically angst-ridden Swedish art movie, by the time it's reached its set of climaxes,Makavejev's film could not have strayed further from the beaten track.
41737|1|Spielberg has dreamed of flying before, and this time he earns his wings.
71646|0|Hoge wastes an impressive cast in his self-important study of misery and murder in American suburbia.
29359|0|For those of who are not fans, its laughs will be forgotten minutes after we exit the theater.
31920|1|Melissa Leo's Oscar-nominated performance as a mother not above illegal business, but resolutely clinging to honesty and not giving into hypocrisy, is terrific. Hope comes from hard sacrifice in a finale proving sometimes possessions are our blessings.
65967|0|Simultaneously stupefying and boring, Videodrome is too extreme a blunder to survive exposure to a justifiably disillusioned horror-movie public.
38861|1|[ Sleepaway Camp] is...a gritty, sleazy Grade-Z rip-off of what Sean Cunningham and the gang more or less perfected over at Crystal Lake.

60831|1|emotionally satisfying for the whole family, as long as you aren't looking for high art or realism
41727|0|The film's grave problem is a lack of central heating: We don't have a single character to warm up to.
100553|1|Compelling but not especially insightful, this is like watching nine months worth of reality TV in an hour and a half. Parental discretion is advised: if you have teens, this won't cheer you up.
74760|0|One ugly duckling of a cartoon.
30148|0|You can focus on the gorgeous locales or the underage skin. Or you could just watch a much better movie.
193|1|A few bright spots, but not anywhere near Brooks' Young Frankenstein.
78950|1|In fact Haxan is a deeply rationalistic piece of humanism, exposing the horrors of superstition and hysteria rather than of witchcraft itself.
81268|1|There's plenty of room to poke holes in the premise, but folks willing to suspend disbelief can still have a good time.
38011|0|Boys and Girls breezes through overly-familiar territory.
44491|0|If you're looking for a good film that features Irving Berlin tunes, this one is not the film you're looking for.
22492|1|A groundbreaking performance by Kevin Bacon
40851|1|This Disney comedy makes a self-conscious and largely successful attempt to modernise the studio's format with a jive-ass sensibility.
87660|1|Perhaps the most accomplished and difficult of Luis Buñuel's Mexican films.
2715|1|Mildly charming.
61744|1|Pleasant farce comedy with likable characters (and no sibling rivalry).
86733|0|Two For The Money is as insincere as the phony football played in the film.
15412|1|With a running time of nearly four hours, Cecil B. De Mille's last feature and most extravagant blockbuster is full of the absurdities and vulgarities one expects, but it isn't boring for a minute.
40243|1|Robert Redford's beguiling drama reminds us even the most hopeless causes can be turned around through the power of positive thinking and perserverance, if we're willing to embrace the possibility of success instead of the probability of failure.
51032|1|Heartwarming and heartbreaking in equal measure, Young At Heart is a good antidote for cynicism.
83174|1|[VIDEO ESSAY] Draped in the manners of fin de siècle in Paris, writer-director Jacques Becker's 1952 milestone of romantic drama is a snapshot of French social mores at the turn of the 20th century.

37504|1|An action masterpiece...
8266|0|As sitcoms go, House Arrest, opening today, is more sit than com.
91497|1|Recommended, if sobering viewing.
64157|0|American Wedding, the hardly awaited sequel to American Pie I and II, picks up right where the others left off. Which is to say it starts at the bottom and works its way down from there.
58736|1|Evokes a little of the fear that parents have for the possible futures of their children--and the sometimes bad choices mothers and fathers make in the interests of doing them good.
72997|1|All the fights are stunningly put together and still deliver in action terms. This may be an old story but it feels very much alive.
99998|1|Lelouch surprises us at every turn and we never know where the story is going to take us.
22807|1|There's a lot of Oscar timber here...
29029|1|[It] soars, not least during its incredibly taut bad-weather flights which pound with the slow thudding tension akin to the depth-charges of Wolfgang Petersen's Das Boot.
18582|1|A smart, intricately constructed thriller, the film has far more on its mind than just who done it.
3526|1|This is all rather low-key and uninsistent, but the settings are gorgeous, and Haskell Wexler's cinematography makes the most of them.
69725|0|This tedious, toddling material would have scuttled Dr. Spock.
100518|1|This glorified soap opera, filled with a higher caste of desperate souls, makes Brideshead worth the revisit.

74994|0|Diesel is an imposing screen presence even when growling risible dialogue.
79247|1|It's certainly fitting that after filling his German years with ballsy, predictive masterpieces about Nazi rule-by-fear, Fritz Lang would finally make a film that directly involves Nazis.
100690|1|Eve & the Fire Horse has a kind of poetry that lifts it above the typical drama of immigrant life and gives [Kwan's] characters a lasting poignancy.

48999|0|Schrader really isn't interested in Crane except as the straw man for his moral lessons about sin and sexuality and the nature of celebrity.
70061|1|Though the film is in French with English subtitles, what people say matters little. Its official language is the international patois of slapstick.
40126|1|A slapstick morality play about the dire consequences of selling one's soul to the Devil and trying to find happiness in wealth, fame, power, or intellectual prowess.
28614|1|Silly, but Chase adds his own brand of humor.
58164|1|The film's signature imagery is impressive and there are some good set-pieces.

48672|0|Gritty, goopy tale of rusting ships and Nazi ghosts.
28819|0|A decent premise laid low by Bracco's lack of credibility and constant whining.
72915|1|A riot, and Joe Dante's most touchingly personal movie at the same time.
68167|1|It's like a colossal buffet: You take what you want and leave the rest, readily forgiving the worst of it because the best just tastes so good.
864|1|Rodriguez has a lot of fun dreaming up cool ways to kill people (he's making this his life's work), but he also gets something resembling a performance from Tarantino and transforms Clooney into a full-fledged movie star.
97311|1|Doesn't quite measure up to its predecessor but it is still an often painfully accurate study of fractured family relationships.
85826|0|The screenplay by Skander Halim falters. It's too convoluted and cloudy to have the intended effect.

16753|0|Okay, Rowan Atkinson is a funny guy. So what the hell happened with this?
93310|0|This documentary on Miami's lethal '80s cocaine scene is cut fast.

51430|1|Not quite Sunset Boulevard but almost.
45008|1|Bad stuff, but manages to be fun bad. (Forget the sequel; that's like torture.)

11235|1|Proof that you can find patriotism in the most unlikely of places.
70658|1|Within the witlessness and crudeness is a touching (or mawkish, depending on your perspective) romantic comedy trying to get out.
80724|1|A gritty, intense and explosive Irish gangster drama that's second only to Scorsese's GoodFellas as the best film of 1990.
47601|0|A baseball movie with no baseball, no movie, and absolutely no love involved.
101727|0|Zucker's film reeks of a deeply insecure psychosis, one that's often insultingly mislabeled as patriotism -- which is how it gets away with wrapping itself in red, white and blue while simultaneously ridiculing our Bill Of Rights.

32270|0|What's bizarre about the movie is how it grafts greeting-card schmaltz on to a muckraking liberal agenda.
34980|1|MacMurray has seldom given a better performance. It is somewhat different from his usually light roles, but is always plausible and played with considerable restraint.
83329|1|This is a wonderful film for the under-five crowd.
48444|0|...minor shortcomings come in its overused setting, slightly lackadaisical pace, and mildly unresolved conclusion, small matters if the movie puts you under its spell.

14749|1|For most of its length, this is a grippingly unpleasant picture of barbaric, gratuitous evil, stealthier and scarier than Funny Games, to which it bears a slight resemblance.
17940|1|Yakin dares to not only enter that neighborhood, but to find beauty and sadness in it, rather than something alien or foreign.

23473|1|It is Edward Norton's riveting performance as a smart kid seduced by horrible ideas that makes the story real.
100441|1|There's incredible feeling behind Steal A Pencil For Me -- enough to sustain two lives throughout unimaginable hardship -- but the film doesn't bring much of it to the surface.
45731|0|DOA was the right title for this, acronym-bending or not.
66067|1|This superb film has long been acknowledged as a classic political thriller, but watching it in today's climate, at a point when a timid and ineffectual media is par for the course, also reveals its increasingly significant value as a time capsule piece.
14301|0|Yes, it's Grumpy Old Presidents, in which most of the comedy comes from the supposed shock of hearing two senior citizens cursing at each other in terms Beavis and Butt-head would find inelegant.

48126|1|In Taken viewers are introduced to a new side of Irish actor Liam Neeson, one that is relentless and likes to hit criminals in the throat -- a lot.
87491|1|Affleck makes a perfectly downcast lightning rod for the ennui-ridden goings-on, and as a director, Buscemi totally gets the defeatist beats of James C. Strouse's script.
41400|1|As a reflexive meditation on the nature of love in the AIDS era, this erio-comedy is poignant but it still bears too much the theatrical sensibility of the source material.
38489|0|The film's second half regresses into a standard woman-in-peril movie.

38676|1|The entire film hinges on the performances.
28357|0|Mostly overacted and overblown, the script tries to make 'outlandish' into outrageous but hardly ever manages it. Missing is the element of some discernible sense of reality that is essential to black comedy.
102080|1|A great introduction to the work of Anna Magnani and Italian neorealist director Luchino Visconti. The dialogue overlaps and everyone speaks quickly, so in all honesty it's a challenge to watch in Italian with English subtitles. But it's also rewarding.

61426|1|One of the warmest and funniest films of the year.
89700|1|Maybe this material isn't entirely fresh, but Zwigoff delivers it with the snap of a quick punch to the face -- which is, in fact, the first image in the film, and a model for innumerable excellent sight gags to follow.

93520|1|Deception, freedom and redemption all weave themselves into a moody tale that holds our attention for most of the time, compounded by Ricci's striking performance and waif-like appearance
7992|0|Like Brothers McMullen-lite and that one was pretty minimal to begin with.
81602|0|This patchwork of horror, time travel, romance, medical and war drama with a thriller through-line suggests an unfortunate case of too many designers in the atelier.
16371|0|By-the-book stuff, but that's what's expected whenever the name 'Steven Seagal' tops the marquee.
85412|0|...an uneven, sometimes rambling journey that elicits mostly false emotion with regard to the payoff suggested by its title.
67035|1|The true joy of this indie stems from the well observed friendship between Gypsy and her Goth plaything, Clive. The chemistry between the two young actors is near-wondrous.
85893|1|This film, like the actress who inspired it, has an appealing sweetness that sneaks up on its viewer.
45907|1|An almost perfect savvy blend of horror and comedy that both honors the horror genre while standing it on its head.

10133|1|One of the most emotionally potent of all animated movies; I might be inclined to say, of all movies, period.
84237|0|Sternfeld started with well-conceived characters and simply didn't succeed in making them flesh. These people have traits instead of personalities; goals instead of dreams.

33577|1|Keitel's performance is perhaps the needed counterpoint to Christopher Walken's ice-cold overlord in Ferrara's visionary crime opus King of New York
99745|0|When Did You Last See Your Father? is based on a true story, but it still feels contrived.
45015|0|Feels like home movie footage of a celebrity barbecue that you weren't invited to.
8888|1|Stanley Donen's stylishly elegant, largely entertaining romance-thriller teams Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn (then at the height of their careers) for the first and only time.
76518|1|Map of the Human Heart is an enjoyable two-hour ride, an unusual and eccentric combination of old-fashioned and modern movie sensibilities, told from a decidedly '90s mindset.
13980|1|The film's many rewards cannot be described in conventional terms.
44526|0|The only importance anyone is likely to associate with this overblown melodrama is self-importance.
86907|1|A documentary about Emmanuel Ofosu Yeboah, a one-legged young man from Ghana, Africa, who overcame his handicap to ride a bicycle across his country, among other amazing achievements.
58218|1|Although I knew it was dishonest, cynical, and the ultimate in cheap-shot humor, I laughed more at Borat than at any other film this year. So I guess the joke is on me.
90723|0|Rarely has a title promised so much, and delivered so little. John Tucker Must Die is toothless, gormless, witless, and, worst of all, deathless.
100481|1|Step Brothers is unashamedly dumb, unoriginal and downright offensively childish. But aren't these the very same reasons why people like these movies?
17829|1|It's kind of astonishing when something this odd slips through the cracks of the Hollywood mainstream.
23708|1|At its best Sid & Nancy has a captivating energy and rawness, and there are even some priceless moments of levity.
21724|0|It's hard for me to sympathize with people I don't like, and except for Lyonne's character I didn't like anyone in the story.
32828|1|A rousing drama of endurance, opportunism and friendship under fire.
17402|0|One star, for principle.
87979|0|A family fantasy that plays at being happy and picture-perfect but primarily comes off as fake and dismayingly unfunny.
102543|1|There are lessons to be learned, but rarely have such lessons been transformed into such vivid and emotionally affecting drama.
91272|1|It's worth seeing for Affleck alone, deftly communicating the distance between the put-on cardboard debonairness of this hunk-about-town and the gnawing uncertainties beneath his Superman outfit.
49066|1|A simple, pleasing romantic comedy with a sharp tongue and a soft heart.
11241|1|Harrelson's finest moment and Love's only moment.
28376|1|The best thing about Bowfinger is the way the script by Steve Martin is tooled to his own and Murphy's comic strengths.
22814|1|Thanks to Carl Franklin's clever direction, which always stays real close to the characters, what could have been a TV movie-of-the-week becomes a thought-provoking and touching film.
81334|1|Fry directs his performers with real sensitivity; as the film moves along it becomes a showcase for some really wonderful ensemble acting.
89041|0|Stay away at all costs. Do not be lulled by nostalgic memories of Inspector Clouseau's malapropisms; do not be fooled by slick print or TV ads; do not let your kids talk you into it.
12577|1|For me, the best film of the 1980s.
77655|1|Two films in one - a mad rollercoaster thriller in the cinema, and a more subtle psychodrama in your head afterwards.
22168|0|A tone-deaf, scattershot and dispiritingly cheesy affair with more groans than laughs.
76429|1|Coming from a director renowned as spartanly anti-dramatic, the film's escape is almost preternaturally gripping.
38758|1|Sharp satire. Great fun.
62872|1|The ending is an unconvincing cop out, but it can't spoil the film's compulsive dramatic tension (or a marvellous comic cameo from Angela Lansbury as Welles' long-suffering mistress).
20493|1|Feels like a stage play with two characters in a single room, but the way the story delicately unfolds keeps us gripped.
5892|1|Moves rather slowly, but the actors and their understated chemistry keep the film riveting, building to a climax that is absolutely heartrending.
85795|1|The true story part of it works. The spy and romance stuff doesn't.
12285|0|No amount of stylistic analysis, however, is likely to explain why a man would devote more than three years of his life to making a war movie in which violent death isn't meant to move us. Does Kubrick really think we're not callous enough about war?

43399|0|Never gets past its own investment in arty pretense.
101977|1|A Christmas Tale has a classical feel, even though the mischievous Desplechin tosses in shadow puppets, iris shots, and actors speaking directly to the camera. It's this ability to surprise that gives the film its spark.
22249|1|One of Hitchcock's creepiest, and his personal favorite among his own films.
39094|0|This is strictly a hit or miss film.
90439|0|Well acted and handsomely photographed, but still extraordinarily overpraised and overblown, a middlebrow piece of near-nonsense: the kind of self-conscious arthouse cinema that is custom-tailored and machine-tooled for the dinner-party demographic.
9626|1|George Romero's remarkably assured debut, made on a shoestring, about a group of people barricaded inside a farmhouse while an army of flesh-eating zombies roams the countryside, deflates all genre clichés.

24040|0|Chase delivers a one-note performance, consisting mainly of predictable comebacks and salacious leers, while the characters who become the targets of his witty rejoinders are weak and silly stereotypes.

85674|0|You can't say those involved in the film didn't have fun -- sure looks like they had a blast. Shame is as an audience we can't say the same.
68103|0|We are invited to believe that Hopkins, Paltrow and Gyllenhaal all have, in their various ways, alpha-brains. They look to me like they couldn't recite the three-times-table without smoke coming out of their ears.

20044|1|The movie that launched a new era in horror films, and which, for one generation, remains one of the scariest experiences of their lives.
58033|1|Tamahori senses what Bond fans have been missing. He and Brosnan deliver it with style, both deserving to try another day.

91374|1|The Black Dahlia doesn't solve the eternal De Palma dilemma, but it sure does fascinate.

55622|1|It was going to take a lot to sell me on the remake. It delivered.
21533|1|It remains the best entry in Bluth's hugely inconsistent filmography.
66924|1|Interesting throughout with an intriguing female slant not seen in most steamy psycho-thrillers.
73926|1|Basically, it's a videogame masquerading as a movie, but the action scenes are so loud and messily edited that they're tedious rather than tense. If it weren't so incoherent, it would be a classic.

89011|1|Without cheap deceptions, clever editing, plot conveniences or overt exposition, the film pulls you in and keeps you there on the merit of the story's substance.
84861|0|No amount of bells & whistles can salvage a screenplay this half-baked.

23343|1|Brought off with such skill and commitment that there isn't any time to snicker at its obviousness!
4695|1|Above the Rim has its formulaic elements, but it has been vigorously directed by Jeff Pollack, who appreciates the lively and unpretentious aspects of the story.
33053|1|Greenaway's eccentric exploration of where all life's absurd varieties must begin and end is, like a road accident, always fascinating, if not exactly pleasurable, to watch.
42122|0|"""For the vast majority of the running time, utter boredom prevails."""
76060|0|Kurt Russell abuses Goldie Hawn into becoming a better, more caring woman? Who thinks this stuff is funny? Lots of people, unfortunately.
81019|0|Believes that shock value in and of itself equals hipness. In actuality, it only equates to pathetic desperation.
54639|0|The third installment in the series of super-spy spoofs, it's handcuffed by the ever-increasing load of baggage it carries.
95098|1|It's as audacious as anything made in the 1970s, running three hours without much of a plot.
80759|1|One of the best documentaries ever made, more fascinating an exploration of obsession than the film it's about.
30421|1|Dramatically, the film seldom fulfils its promise, and its pessimistic 'moral' -- that good and evil do not always meet with their just deserts -- looks contrived and hollow. Intriguing and patchily effective, nevertheless.
6197|1|There are those wonderful performances by the lead players - and especially Channing, who has been underused or misused most of her film career - and they make it fairly enjoyable entertainment.
36924|1|An influential little horror gem
50202|0|Unfortunately, at more than two hours, all of this is a bit too much.
100359|0|Though Moving McAllister's heart and soul are in the right place, it's a terrible excuse for a movie.
69597|1|There are minor merits. mostly handsome production values, to Mingehlla's screen version of the acclaimed novel.
35914|1|'80s sex comedy is extremely raunchy, graphic.
61636|1|Filmed with exceptional care and remarkable photographic ingenuity, no other nature documentary is as personal and as close-up as this one to the peculiarities of birds.
82189|1|Fits snugly into the 'Christmas movie' canon by tapping into familiar problems, tugging at the heartstrings and stirring your tired soul.
77483|0|If the first movie was stupid, Apocalypse is ten times dumber. [Full review in Spanish]
22845|0|So here's two good performers and a good idea, gorgeous camera work....and nothing else. The idea was funny but I thought it was executed poorly at times.
52024|0|He's Just Not That Into You is just insultingly average in every way, spending 129 minutes telling us what we already know: girls and boys don't always click.
8858|1|"""Nobody's perfect"" is the last line. Wilder, Lemmon, Curtis and Monroe come pretty close."
98602|1|The ensemble cast chemistry is superb in its nearly suffocating tangle of repressed passions, but the family-values wrap-up of all these messy erotic tensions feels ultimately far too pat and unresolved.
18218|1|Not only is it hilarious, but it's a damn good detective story that has fun toying around with all the tired old conventions of the detective story
69029|1|It makes for entrancing cinema.
67880|1|An amusing diversion, with Woods and Fox perfectly cast.
91582|0|We are never allowed to get truly lost in Pan's Labyrinth. The fantasy sequences are fetching when they should be intoxicating, while the scenes above ground are largely prosaic.
83546|0|We watch Marion and Gilles with a sort of clinical detachment, and it's difficult to really care.
91245|0|So there's still a smart office-horror movie left to be made. In the meantime, Severance is just another paycheck.
14455|1|Claude Chabrol peaked with this engrossing and shocking thriller.
79860|1|The film interestingly makes its young heroic lead an atheist rather than the usual follower of Christ, but some script deficiencies hamper the overall project.
46262|0|Style wins out over substance again.
51386|0|I guarantee you this would have been 100% more effective if Wood and Culkin switched roles
35072|1|Controversial, bloody 1980s WWIII film with teen heroes.
39207|1|We're challenged to tip our hats to this folksinger who found his own way into the dream he had as a boy.
99121|1|An unusually cheery movie from veteran British writer-director Mike Leigh; one of the ten best films of 2008
32516|1|Unnerving, upsetting and hard to forget
62499|1|With gorgeous images by cinematographer Kim Hyungkoo and with Chen Kaige's observation of telling details, Together becomes a sweet story with a tart kick.
39087|1|Ribald, wild Zucker comedy with Leslie Nielsen in usual wild form.
51729|0|Manages the amazing feat of seeming to both drag out its material and completely skim over it.
16089|0|Leave It to Beaver is the sort of movie that could be described as good clean fun if it happened to be good or fun.
98868|1|Strictly for kids.
59689|1|A picture-perfect example of how three great performers can elevate even the slightest and most lightweight material imaginable.
81304|1|The glimpses of human behavior feel genuine.
94056|0|It's a pity Frank is too busy laying on the wintry atmospherics to make the story grip as it should.
62873|0|The Long, Hot Summer starts superbly and ends in a senseless, flabby heap.
41359|1|David Fincher directs a nail-biter starring Jodie Foster about a mother and daughter who defend their house against a brutal home invasion.
62531|0|To say the love story was hard to believe, is putting it mildly--it was impossible to fathom.
17816|0|Like the Newtons themselves, the film never goes for the kill.
62851|1|Tension, teamwork and a lust for life fuel this admirable remake of the popular 1965 Jimmy Stewart film.
21176|1|This is the best kind of comedy, the kind in which there is truth behind the laughs.
19056|1|It is a most affecting and impressive picture.
22346|0|Highly entertaining but practically incomprehensible.
50513|1|If the movie tells an old story, its unvarnished realism lends it poignancy and depth.
87688|0|Sound silly? Well, it is, plus passé (as so many techno-concerned conceits soon become), self-indulgent and nihilistically nasty in tone.
69937|1|Surprisingly funny and expectedly rude, this first starring vehicle by vilified standup comic Andrew Dice Clay has a decidedly lowbrow humor that is a sort of modern equivalent of that of the Three Stooges.
41708|1|Few films connect with the punk experience like Dogs In Space, a slice of life in Seventies Melbourne that brings together all the major concerns of its era.
15941|0|As a movie, 'Spawn' can't make up its mind what it wants to be any more than its protagonist knows who he is or what he wants to be.
59683|1|I, the Jury is a violent private eye thriller, with a certain redeeming sense of style.
38258|0|Vulgar, racially insulting laugh getter.
35039|0|This sequel is less abrasive than its predecessor and was considerably less successful at the box office.
47514|1|A strangely lyrical tale of addiction and family distance.
21941|1|Better than French fries at the Covent Garden 'Fish & Chips'.
3211|0|With a tip of the hat to the performers, this is a misguided comedy with Hall of Shame pedigree. Its commercial prospects are quick, down and dirty.
8399|1|Few will argue that this is one of Chan's best films; I say it's the best.
17010|1|Although there isn't much of a mystery, there is plenty of suspense and the film is a satisfying piece of exotic escapism, one that lets you learn a little bit along the way.
22767|0|Painfully disengaged from anything human.
62832|1|There's secure star power with actors James Garner and Sidney Poitier, who deliver leathery performances.
102378|1|Twenty minutes in, we know Walt is eventually going to give the car to the kid. The only question is how.
21355|1|De Palma continues perfecting his brilliant visual style within the most blatantly artificial plot scenarios.
80796|1|Delicious baroque treat.
26846|1|When his instincts are just right Kore-eda has both the perfect technique and the perfect touch for suggesting (without explicitly defining) the immanence of human experience.
53991|0|A film divided into past and present sections that are ridiculously disparate.
40420|0|"An unforgivable transgression from the usually reliable Ron Howard, ""Grinch"" boasts the visual polish of a Menards tree aisle and resembles not a cheerful Christmas, but rather what the bloodcurdling onset of a mescaline bender might feel like."
24557|0|They should-a stopped at IV.
94068|1|Ferrell doesn't need a great script or direction to be funny. The man just is funny.
45036|1|There are no titles in this film -- merely a few inserts to guide the viewer. And yet one is never in doubt as to the action of this admirable picture, which is a remarkable piece of direction, with exquisite lighting effects.
52651|1|Ken Russell's searing drama about life and sex in America.
36128|1|A thoughtful, charming sleeper.
74306|1|One of Minnelli's best pictures, a visually stunning portrait of Van Gogh, splendidly played by Kirk Douglas
8478|0|Gone Fishin' is a slapdash, slapstick waste of time -- hook, line and stinker.
6892|0|Lee may have a keen sense of setting and dialogue, but his characterization is off.
21100|1|It's also very funny, thanks largely to Candy in the lecherous fat sidekick role, and a string of set pieces that show Hannah as, quite literally, a fish out of water.
59357|0|When Wilder is on form he can be an irresistible comic draw, but this apologetic male fantasy piece is terribly heavy handed and corny.
787|1|Neither caustic nor sentimental, it's a film that maybe half the people on Earth have at one time considered writing.
60779|1|Effective, if peculiar, mixture of screwball comedy and political moralising.
101472|1|Probably the most authentic and unsentimental mafia movie ever to come out of Italy.
95725|0|Crude, knockabout stuff.
62155|0|The genuine affection Washington Heights displays for the Manhattan neighborhood of the same name can't make up for its lack of originality.
86118|0|Nothing about the plot has any real spark, besides the gimmicky set-up.
4146|0|Despite some likable performances (Epps is especially winning), the drama in Higher Learning is constricted, hemmed in by Singleton's compulsion to view his characters as walking paradigms of racial and sexual politics.
40344|1|You won't meet a nicer dysfunctional family all year.
97742|1|As directed by Gene Kelly, this mildly amusing comedy Western benefits from the stature of Henry Fonda and Jimmy Stewart.
62149|1|may inspire some to get off at 191st street
89596|0|This is a movie for fourteen-year-olds that feels like it's been written by one.
62829|1|Wayne is decent, but this is a compromised Western due to the fact that ailing director Michael Curtiz (it's his last film) has no appreciation for the genre.
95692|1|For theater people and French literature buffs...a delightful game of spot-the-reference...
16932|1|The script is shrewd and inventive, combining wit, romance, and intelligent melodrama into a crowd-pleasing whole.
49530|1|Hello, gorgeous!
26848|1|This is a very special movie, unlike anything I've seen in a long time.
79172|1|A delight.
4050|1|The movie's central value and its most melancholy tone -- Lee's star presence. It's amazing and it's tragic.
43601|1|Melodramatic, and camp as Christmas, but nothing like the disaster its reputation suggests.
231|1|Hey, are you looking for an exciting movie about pirates of the, well, um, Caribbean? [Blu-ray]
13574|0|Hype wants you to think that a few interviews with some less popular bands and some poorly shot concert footage lend the film an insider legitimacy and credibility that excuse it from the same accountability it demands from other media.
42874|0|Seagal -- who turns 50 in a few weeks -- has been inactive for the past few years, and it shows.
80570|0|Speaks to our fantasies of rectifying mistakes of the past but drops the ball on a satire on small town foibles and marital discord.
64067|1|Offers a fascinating look into the skater's tumble from grace, as well as chronicling the renaissance of his rebel sport.
72760|1|All a bit too earnest, despite the seriousness of the subject, with Fonda setting her jaw and stepping into father's footsteps as Tinseltown's very own protector of humanity; but it's tightly scripted and directed, and genuinely tense in places.
14225|0|A dumb but lively rock musical.
79187|1|There are some nice comic moments peppered throughout, but more interesting than the film itself is its influence on film and TV.
10002|1|This is one of Disney's best, and one of the all-time adventure greats. And that, I swear by my tattoo.
28418|1|Better Than Chocolate is warm and loving, if not partcularly wise or nuanced.
87515|0|Os dez minutos finais de projeção parecem pertencer a um outro filme. Bem ruim, por sinal.
66251|0|Julia Roberts, a beauty who can also act, is one of the best things in recent movies. By my count she hasn't made a really good movie yet.
40655|1|It is, of course, always a pleasure to watch Martin's steam-gauge face register his rising internal pressures and to witness his exquisitely expressed blowoffs. But Candy offers even more insinuating delights.
91427|0|Mostly the movie barrels toward you, stiff-armed.
4333|1|The smart script by 23-year-old newcomer Helen Childress doesn't lose sight of the characters and the issues that affect them and other young adults.
15671|0|Clearly, it wishes to be different, but anyone who fondly recalls the buddy films of the '70s will find it to be more of the same.
45191|1|The brutality of the film's characters and its scenario are shocking enough today, but in 1955, they were gobsmacking.
58861|1|With the finest rhythm of any Ghibli film, this masterwork gently see-saws the faint aches of youth with utter trust in the wonder of a nature-inspired imagination. In lulling, Ozu-like moments, the landscape twinkles in its beauty, like the film itself.
98249|0|Will Ferrell's Semi-Pro is a dreadful comedy. It's lazy and slipshod.
85471|1|Nothing new or groundbreaking here, just a lot of talented people coming together for a well-made and entertaining Western.
95916|1|"Unfortunately, we've seen this jolly inventory of slasher-flick clichés before, in other parodies dating back to ""Scream."" And with not much new to contribute, ""Behind the Mask"" starts running out of narrative momentum about two-thirds of the way through."
7137|0|This film was made very quickly by animation standards, and the haste shows.
101618|1|An absorbing and weirdly enjoyable portrait of a slight, meritless man and his calamitous presidency.
46255|0|...a relic of the 1980s.
49280|1|Romantic comedy is pretty tame for Farrelly Bros.
73027|1|There is a compelling desperation about La Peau Douce that gives its moments of hope or intimacy a piercingly moving intensity, while the briskness of its pace never allows it to wallow in abjection.
60628|0|It's a movie located in an interesting place, but without quite enough self-confidence really to inhabit it.
22953|1|Seema Biswas' lock on our fascination and sympathies is unreleasable, making for a most powerful film from India.
83144|0|"Even at eleven years old I knew ""Double Dragon"" sucked."
34523|0|...a silly, thoroughly unmemorable comedy...
16428|1|What impressively begins as a gentle social satire gradually becomes a conventional family melodrama, one that lacks a clear moral center and in which the parents are just as confused as their children
33186|0|A big, fabulous tease-and nothing more.
95166|0|The dull romance between Sadie and Ben is revealed as little more than a prop for the comedian's patented schtick.
14376|1|A highly original and funny film.
55966|1|In a larger sense, this powerfully muckraking film is about the accountability of public figures and about how, in regard to international justice, there can be no exceptions.
2982|0|Semi-entertaining mystery/thriller.
95232|1|Yates leaps into big-budget cinema like a kid in a candy store, packing in nearly every compelling image from the 870-page source material.
18446|1|Oceans rise, cities fall, subtlety dies.
81448|0|Its star, Juliette Binoche, may be a fine actress, but she's also very French. And no matter how hard she tries to perfect the tricky Afrikaans accent, she's simply not believable playing a South African poet.
70938|0|If Disney Pictures is looking to pander to the lowest urges of emerging girlhood, they have succeeded in this tacky and boring after-school special.
77090|1|a very emotionally effective working-class drama
93945|0|Well-intentioned, at best, regrettably, this fairly formulaic, Philly sports flick doesn't show enough brotherly love for anyone to be proud of it.
36054|0|A contrived script and lackluster performances are the worst sins of this uninspired comedy.
93312|0|After beginning at a healthy clip, the film becomes mired in endless remembrances of debaucheries past and Miami's descent into lawlessness.
30226|1|A shrewd, scintillating work rooted in an investigation of varying degrees of masculinity and extremism.
24814|1|Not since 1979's Kramer vs. Kramer has a mainstream movie more accurately, insightfully, humorously or tear-jerkingly dramatized family life in our time than Stepmom!
42106|0|A costume drama with far more costumes than drama.
60699|0|it seems that Elizabeth's problem isn't that she's clinically depressed. It's because she's a first class a-hole. (That's a scientific term)
38740|0|Space Cowboys doesn't so much embrace high concept as get dragged behind it kicking and screaming.
75125|1|Though most of the tension of the theatrical presentation is gone, the movie preserves a lot of the play's lunatic humor. It also understands the Shepard concern for characters who have somehow found themselves cut loose from any social roots.
23840|0|Doesn't merit much enthusiasm or indignation; it just skitters across your consciousness, leaving no traces except a vague depression.
9877|0|Pleasant enough, but underwhelming, and curiously lacking in wonder, even in the high-flying finale.
28119|1|Beresford fails to generate sufficient chemistry to bind the performances. Occasional bursts of delicious tragic humour nevertheless make this a not unlikeable 'feminist' mood piece.
42583|1|Lovecraft Lite, from the studio that made the world safe for Edgar Allan Poe.
25455|1|Carl Boehm must be credited with a portrayal whose discretion has probably saved the film from its own worst excesses of morbidity.
74419|1|"If ""Hiroshima, Mon Amour"" is best enjoyed for its place in film history, its tragic love story and its haunting black-and-white cinematography, that still makes it a veritable must-see."
19296|0|Bernstein's music, Sondheim's lyrics and Robbins's choreography are great, but as a movie it falls short of the truly inspired cinematic musicals.
54288|0|I'd encourage you to avoid this bad comedy at all costs.
89666|1|While Yamada essentially repeats himself structurally, he finds fresh ironies in the story of how a culture built on tradition gets corrupted by technology and years of inaction.
69498|1|Profane, shockingly un-PC and often laugh-out-loud hilarious, this is the sort of parody that the folks who made the Airplane and Naked Gun movies used to make -- funny.
74371|1|Though a bit overstuffed with long-winded speeches, Chayefsky's scabrously funny script brims with snappy, crackling dialogue.
13731|1|The atmospheric opening is the best part -- moody and full of sinister potential. After that, it's stilted drawing-room talk, variably acted, except for the cultish over-the-top dementia of Dwight Frye.
66277|0|About as scary as Count Chocula.
101025|1|While many viewers may watch it primarily to look for clues as to the filmmaker Fellini would become, there's actually a perfectly satisfying narrative at its core.
26953|0|Dunaway does not chew scenery. Dunaway starts neatly at each corner of the set in every scene and swallows it whole, costars and all.
27020|1|Superman fights a super computer with a mind of its own.
37030|1|A striking film -- one that feels like it was made at least 10 years earlier -- and, I must note, a fairly depressing one.
63173|0|The idea of gruff, scruffy Reno and the elegant- as-ever Binoche getting together is far too ridiculous to swallow even for a minute.
11035|1|E.T. is essentially a spiritual autobiography, a portrait of the filmmaker as a typical suburban kid set apart by an uncommonly fervent, mystical imagination. It comes out disarmingly funny, spontaneous, bighearted.
30915|0|Horror film purists may object to the levity even though failed, as a lot of it is.
87695|0|It's his heavy-handed and often ludicrous plotting that is the film's downfall.
100361|0|Bad really is too delicate a word to describe the film.
66732|0|The script is on autopilot and even the voice work feels phoned in.
51851|1|A tone poem of transgression.
7559|1|Occasionally Ghost in the Shell shows its age and the added CGI elements, while appropriate for the story, also help make this film feel more dated than it might have otherwise.
10208|1|Wonderful entertainment for both kids and their parents.
100058|1|Gonzo is much more than a tribute to a maverick and genuine pioneer. It's a lament for the gaping hole that Thompson left behind. The only obvious weakness is Gibney's reluctance to engage fully with Thompson's toxic personal life.
49225|0|una colección de huecos inexplicables en su guión.
101583|0|A massive waste of time and a glaring missed opportunity.
69741|1|A beautifully made, unapologetically artistic piece of work.
38708|1|...one can't help but admire the glee with which Verhoeven has imbued the film's more disgusting moments...
11971|1|This film is also the best monster movie of the year and the best picture of any kind to open so far this summer. Put it another way: Aliens is the Jaws of the '80s.
55248|1|Meyer makes a fine directorial debut, pacing the film for optimal suspense despite some obvious holes in the script.
47799|0|Romp about trading places has stereotypes, sensuality.
35517|0|The usually dependable Rob Cohen directs from a ludicrous script.
58150|0|"Given the amazing artwork, if a better character [than a cyborg John Silver] had been inserted, we'd be talking about ""Treasure Planet"" as another Disney classic."
52316|1|Although there's nothing profound about Pauline and Paulette, it does have a few memorably sly digs at the kinds of things we believe to be profound.
79769|1|The restored version becomes a near masterpiece--a most powerful but fragmented western of epic proportions.
95824|1|Compared to the likes of Election and Rushmore, Blitz's film is hardly top-of-the-class, but nonetheless in Hal Hefner - partly thanks to Thompson's fine work - he has crafted an enduring cult figure who deserves a sequel all of his own.
26948|1|Wire Hangers!
2693|0|This is a long way from the social comedy of Jerry Lewis. The characters here are ultimately turned into punching bags or punch-line dispensers.
26234|1|Lovely filming of a classic Rodgers and Hammerstein show
27356|0|...coast[s] along on the charisma of the actors...
52697|0|While we can forgive Cattaneo for succumbing to temptation, we must also damn him and screenwriter Ronan Bennett (Face) for failing to attempt to improve on the original idea.
96868|1|Relentlessly uneven yet basically entertaining...
36958|1|It's not often you find Charlie Chaplin in the rare role of a villain, but he does nice work in this small tale of lies and murder.
98831|1|Telling antiwar film as seen through the eyes of those patriotic volunteers who fought in Iraq and are now disillusioned.
89500|0|Perfectly enjoyable but nothing special
9155|0|Like Violet Kray producing a film about her twin sons. The movie doesn't ignore its subject's shortcomings, but it sentimentalises them and becomes increasingly incoherent as it proceeds.
72422|0|Tired, poorly paced Bond from 1967, with Sean Connery displaying his discontent.
74942|1|Begins as a satire, ends with a renewal of faith.
25221|1|DeVito at his best.
82415|1|The Cosby touch (he's co-writer and co-executive producer) is in full effect, schmaltz notwithstanding, as Albert and the gang run through their series of pleasantly diverting escapades.
17853|1|Paulie isn't a complicated film, but it is heartfelt. And for a change, parents in the theater won't feel embarrassed by the things their children are laughing at.
21797|1|Upbeat dance-romance is fine for tweens and up.
82503|0|The film feels like the victim of too many rewrites and edits, with lots of plotlines that go nowhere or feel oddly unfulfilled.
40177|0|"In ninety minutes of screen time, ""Book of Shadows"" doesn't provide a single moment of suspense or a single frightening scene."
72253|0|A little less than half of the film worked for me, which cannot justify a recommendation.
17056|1|Aiming to instruct and entertain, and often struggling to reconcile these goals, Amistad lacks the subtlety of tone and simplicity of form that made Schindler's List one of Spielberg's very best; here, however, every idea and image are too explicit.
100747|1|This movie is definitely not as good as the first as it seemed to lack showing the bonding moments that made these girls true friends.
72131|1|The movie is populated with real wrestlers, and it makes sure to nail all the little details.
92873|1|There's nothing inherently wrong with MISS POTTER. It's just a throwback to the biopics of the 1930s and 40s and in some ways it may seem progressive to contemporary audiences.
73567|1|One of the greatest cops-and-crooks films ever made, High and Low is a combination of immensely powerful psychodrama and exquisitely detailed police procedural.
19845|0|The only thing that needs new blood injected into it is this franchise
6013|1|With its faithful rendering of a true inspirational story, Rudy earns its sentiment...an irresistable inspirational movie for all ages. [Blu-ray]
63352|0|Uncompelling but moderately engaging.
53587|1|As perpetually uneven as its underwhelming predecessor...
79277|0|Largely forgotten and for good reason, interesting now as a mile-marker on Davis' lonesome road to irrelevance.
83262|0|The movie never transcended its elaborate production work to achieve an independent reality. It's simply pictures of what never happened.
10143|1|Indispensible.
78230|1|Built of fleeting minimalist vignettes, almost snapshots, glimpses of its subject rather than an integral portrait. Is the final explanation from below or from above?
24030|0|If you like Chevy Chase, you'll like this movie. If not, it's just a time killer.
98126|0|Pretentious in its tone, ambitious in its goals, and incompetent in its execution, The Air I Breathe is a polluted mess despite its good intentions.
15640|0|Jerry Bruckheimer should be thankful for the modern audience's short attention span.
45800|1|Ernest's best film. Actually quite funny.
72504|1|As the broadcasting tycoon, Fredric March is excellent, and the scenes between him and Peck lift the picture high above the ordinary.
41516|0|The material is uneven; some of it is very funny while other skits fall flat.
70594|0|Even though it has a few chilling and comical moments, overall it drags and doesn't have much of a bite.
12618|1|"How can you not love a movie with the line, ""Your mother ate my dog""?"
4232|0|As beautifully photographed and intelligently-written as the movie is, it has no emotional depth or appeal, and is often as cold and clinical as its gray depiction of Seattle.
77692|1|Enough of a pointed study of character that it's more than just a collection of some of the best and most ridiculous jokes in a generation.
101141|0|The Spirit is hollow, with a convoluted plot, and Miller has clearly opted for visual style over thematic depth.
3374|0|Steve Martin reprises his role as the bumbling Inspector Clouseau in this hideous sequel to a boring remake.
86799|1|I was surprised to find myself strolling along the film's basic plotline, not necessarily bowled over by what I was seeing, but not exactly disliking it either.
57361|1|The principals in this cast are all fine, but Bishop and Stevenson are standouts.
7576|0|Ultimately Ghost in the Shell remains a hard sell, with sluggish pacing and sloppy storytelling effectively smothering the strengths of this lackluster effort.
9575|0|Although a stream of hard-boiled wisecracks keeps things amusing, the plot gets tied up in the usual dreary whodunit business of providing motives for all and sundry.

30982|1|Maybe Michael Douglas' best work, he as the depressed man driven to madness.
27312|0|One of the worst films ever made.
36209|1|There is no attempt to set Sands up as a great martyr, no Jesus pose or sentimental music to manipulate emotions. Hunger is interested in none of this. Instead, [McQueen] lets the bodies that sacrificed themselves tell the story they created.
97768|0|One big miss of a horror movie.
93857|1|Nair may have bitten off more than she -- or anyone -- could chew with this sprawling narrative, but she's done as right by it as possible.
36504|0|Here's a tip for casting directors: If you want your female lead to be sympathetic, do not hire Kristen Scott Thomas.
5799|1|[An] extremely well-made message picture about tolerance, justice and discrimination is pitched at mainstream audiences, befitting its position as the first major Hollywood film to directly tackle the disease.
14489|1|It's not stupid, it's not wussy and it pulls off a couple of pretty nasty jolts.
69735|0|The movie has no idea what to do with its premise, so instead it churns out scene after scene of tired slapstick.
31473|1|Newman and Woodward's daughter Potts steals the movie, but what makes it so watchable is Newman's reluctance to sentimentalise.
24519|1|Rocky III is an audience-involving film and it is to Stallone's credit that we cheer for the champ in both victory and defeat.
48389|1|The film lives through the superb raw angst-ridden performance of Phil Daniels.

63543|0|Feature length films should no longer be hand drawn if the studios want the public to shell out fifty bucks to take the family to see them on the big screen.
100299|0|It's a movie that seems to have been lavished with care and performed with gusto, yet its tale of fakery sounds its own knell: there's not a believable moment in it.
43089|0|The visuals look dark, grubby and cheap, making us feel like we're watching a shoddy knock-off rather than an enthusiastic remake
94533|0|Loses its way, as if uncertain how to point out its moral and make us laugh at the same time.
70870|0|In a certain way, with the help of insomnia and perhaps the closure of one eye, Fire Birds actually works in a minor key. Let's just say it's the best 77-minute Apache helicopter actioner starring Nicolas Cage I've ever seen.
80530|1|The movie has since become a cult classic; one that those of a certain age and gender have committed to near memory and can spout lines and scenes on command like a new Army recruit.
81262|0|Based on the Ray Bradbury short story of the same name, this is a colassal disapopintment - unworthy of the memorable source material.
8728|1|Enduringly enjoyable romantic comedy always worth a revisit. Tone and performances are delicately judged, and Hepburn is radiant throughout.
77863|1|Rough, but it's an interesting type of sensationalism from a (thankfully) bygone production era. It's not a film to be enjoyed, but it certainly offers a singular genre bite that's impressively gonzo.
7652|1|What must ultimately emerge is admiration for human courage balanced with horror at what Melville's 'Ah humanity' can do.
36048|1|There is genuine chemistry among this trio that is fun to watch, and the script will keep you giggling.

19502|1|This is American mainstream movie-making at its best.
86099|0|There are parts of the film that engage and others that are just plain silly. Pity. With a better script, Just Like Heaven just might have been a winner.
39391|0|Bait makes a fatal mistake, one this kind of movie should never make unless it actually is The Matrix or Terminator 2: Judgment Day: It's long.
71106|1|As good as are Widmark, with his proto-Method grin, and Peters, with her tawny, untutored naturalism, this is Thelma Ritter's movie. She transforms what could have been no more than a colorful eccentric to a figure of unshakable dignity.
1379|0|The principals all seem to be enjoying themselves, so when do we get in on the fun?
74685|1|[The plot] is all no more than fancy padding around the film's heart, which only starts to really pump when Prince is up on stage: a teasing, hot amalgam of Marc Bolan, Nijinsky and the Scarlet Pimpernel, as electric as his guitar.

3973|1|The best movies Woody Allen made in the '90s by a fairly large margin.

93364|0|Fueled by a decidedly American formula of can-do crazy, The Astronaut Farmer feels, for all its libertarianism, a little lost in space.
20959|1|This is the vision of Peter Pan that I would want in my head when I read the story.
90513|0|No level of noble intent by the filmmakers can compel me to recommend a work of cinema that's this cheap, simplistic and sloppy.

93687|1|Zodiac is a great film that many true crime buffs would love due to the treatment given to the subject, and that many movie fans will admire thanks to David Fincher's direction and the performances of its cast.
18993|1|The film made Ayres a star.
81211|0|As a director [Ball] amplifies the flaws in his own writing; his supporting characters are too broadly pitched to take seriously, and he tends to smack you in the face with the point of every scene.
73070|1|For six hours that seemed more like two, I was wrapped up in a human drama that was also a historical drama and a genuine wonder of filmmaking.

49180|1|Dark, suspenseful thriller has mature themes, profanity.
65431|1|Given its complex array of fact, fiction, location, character and atmosphere, Millennium Actress is almost unimaginable in any other medium.
70516|0|You're glad that Brooks and his team have received the big-screen treatment that their story seems ideal for. But it's sad to see their excellence revisited in such a mediocre movie.

61098|0|I had to take on faith that the plot could, theoretically, be made sense of
6159|1|It's a funny/scary vision, with a manic edge -- which is why, when you come down from the high of the filmmaking, you may be left with the taste of ashes in your mouth. Altman's artistry can make you happy even when his art offers cold comfort.
61833|1|"An ingenious thriller molded from Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None"". The film's incredibly entertaining even with the measurably predictable twist."
7261|0|"This is the old gritty Clint -- the ""Do you feel lucky punk?"" Clint."
53578|1|About a Boy is better than a feelgood movie, it's a feelgreat movie -- genuinely clever, affecting when you least expect it to be and funny from start to finish.

30928|0|Just as you can't judge a '50s comic book by its lurid cover, so you can't judge a cheapo, three-part film by its sources.
91135|1|The movie is also burdened by some amateurish acting in supporting roles, but Mackie and Jonathan are the real deal, and they get good support from Wayne Brady as a smarmy sports agent.
33782|0|The songs seem to have been written over lunch at the Disney cafeteria.
68600|1|The power of his film comes from its resolutely human focus.
57460|1|The performances are zesty and consistently enjoyable, with everyone having a high old time speaking in an accent as thick and heavy as a slab of Mackinac Island fudge.
84796|1|It ain't no Rocky, but it ain't half bad.
32404|1|The wonderful combination of the sweetness and the extraordinary technical accomplishments of the first film are maintained, but its overall impact falls a little flat with a storyline that never quite delivers the original magic.
11790|1|Day Lewis' re-creation of writer/painter Christy Brown's condition is so precise, so detailed and so matter-of-fact that it transcends the carping about casting an actor without cerebral palsy.
74391|1|Regarded as scandalous when it was first released, Baby Doll has lost its shock value but retains a strong, sweaty Deep South sensuality.
12452|1|Not an easy film, but almost certainly a great one.
94804|1|Gracie is a gentle, easygoing picture -- it's not exactly dramatically gripping, but somehow, its spirit carries it through.
70666|1|It's nearly a profound concept, but only nearly. Remember that 50 First Dates is an Adam Sandler movie: there are limits.
94457|0|My screening presented the final reel upside down and backward; no difference whatsoever.
57734|0|Standing in the Shadows of Motown takes one of the great unknown stories in music history and translates it to the screen in the blandest way possible.
21155|0|I thought the original Halloween was overrated, the 2 or three cheapie sequels I've seen were even worse, and this new entry is still crap.

10962|1|Both a vibrant tribute to rock cult figure Jim Morrison and to the decade in which he flourished.
66901|1|While this is a movie that deserves a mildly favourable recommendation, it's also nothing short of a catastrophic fumble and an incredible lost opportunity.
39022|0|There isn't a single bone of originality in its entire 110-minute running time, yet it just almost works out of sheer force of will.
27834|1|Kids will find the oozing slime and ghastly, ghostly apparitions to their liking and adults will enjoy the preposterously clever dialog.
59037|0|Too defensive and earnest about its topic to be either fun or illuminating.
68799|1|It's not bad, but Woody is definitely better at directing himself.
21039|1|"A vision of artistry and pure entertainment, ""Sleeping Beauty"" will never, ever grow old."
76757|0|Evilspeak may provide a laugh or two, but it's too easily noticeable that there's just not much here, resulting in an empty film that feels stretched beyond its means.
64600|1|Pryce gives one of the year's most refreshingly uninhibited performances as the boy's weird, postmodern hippie brother-in-law Norman. And Fletcher is a genuine star. His devilish precocity makes The Rachel Papers a bracing treat.
73791|0|Schlocky AIP venture, with Winters hamming it up.
33669|0|Gun Shy is also likely to be a bad career move for producer/co-star Sandra Bullock.
46008|1|Surface stuff, moderately contemptuous, but entertaining enough.
19864|0|Even the finest Friday the 13th flicks barely qualify as actual movies, so it's fairly clear where the lesser entries lie on the scale of quality.
9668|1|Frank Capra's most ambitious and disturbing film, Meet John Doe is possibly more relevant today than when it first appeared in 1941.
58932|0|"Finally, the ""ten-speed bike"" opus we've all been waiting for."
22401|0|Said husband, as well as the family's other members, are as bland and forgettable as the 1920s British cuisine on display.
101248|0|The yawning chasm between the film's aspirations to social significance and its cheese-o-licious straight-to-video construction make it a chucklesome guilty pleasure.
17514|0|A light, easy-going fluff piece.
20145|1|A loving celebration, and biting critique, of our pop culture-saturated times.
7938|0|I lost count of how many times I laughed out loud at the wrong places.
33502|1|"Misunderstood, this original belgian film is a stairical stab at serial killers, our new ""cultural icons""; the moral was misinterpreted by some critics."
78878|1|Provides an enjoyable ride, even if style wins out over substance.
4098|0|Dismal, awful, excruciatingly unfunny - and I loved the cartoons growing up.
100118|1|This Oscar-nominated gem reveals far more than the traditional documentary by coming at the subject from an unexpected angle to reveal a myriad of unvarnished truths.
86724|1|Por trás de uma trama aparentemente convencional, esconde-se um inteligente estudo de personagem beneficiado pela estupenda atuação de Pacino (que conta também com o belo desempenho de seu companheiro de elenco, McConaughey).
70639|0|A cocky and condescending indulgence test for anyone who hasn't automatically bought into its faux-cool suave.

45063|0|A basically honest, rugged and mature saga has been sapped of a great deal of effect by an obvious, overlong and garrulous anticlimax.

96547|1|In the end [it] isn't about victory or defeat... It's about surviving another day, doing one's job, and getting back to family.
18593|1|Sexist, shallow and silly. Teens+.
18975|0|It is hopelessly inept and incompetent, but has a place in the canon, albeit a lowly one. It lets us know how badly things can go wrong, and how passion is not always enough.

25340|1|It is a surprise, and a disappointment.

68387|0|The result's mostly empty at heart and hollow on top.
96409|0|A sequel, a costume fantasy, a romantic melodrama, a CGI war spectacular, a puzzling celebration of beauty over substance.

78530|0|Instead of laughing with Bridget, The Edge of Reason laughs at her.
41237|1|It's like some kind of dumb toy that doesn't do anything or go anywhere, but it is fun to watch as it spins mindlessly around and around.
58760|1|Carnahan isn't breaking new ground, but he has administered an astoundingly visceral shot of adrenaline to the police-procedural genre.
39625|1|The best performance here, though, is by Will Patton who infuses his Coach Yoast with the humanity that's strangely missing from Washington's Coach Boone.
77982|1|Putting the fun back into misanthrope

59132|0|An empty, incoherent exercise in frenetic style, interesting primarily for its cosmopolitan flavor.

46004|1|It might never be remembered as a great film - or even as a great Schwarzenegger film - but it's a great slice of nostalgia.
74382|1|Wallach as the vengeful Vacarro plays it to the hilt. Malden is cast to perfection and turns in a socko performance.
3303|1|The film isn't, ultimately, quite able to reach the heights attained by its star...
57642|0|[Creates] the worst kind of mythologizing, the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama.
96666|1|It works eerily well.
29471|1|I can think of no better beginning for a first-time filmgoer than The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland.
25459|1|Fear, as it turns out, is the most frightening thing in the world, and Peeping Tom makes us feel it palpably as few films have been able to do.

7028|1|A snappy, fun adaptation that entertains young viewers without speaking down to them.
81587|0|There's nothing wrong with a little vicarious experience when you go to the movies, but the director seems to think that his supernatural psycho thriller has to drive you crazy, just to get what it's like to be really insane.
22341|1|A most endearing Alfred Hitchcock whirl
41396|0|This is yet another melodrama haunted by the Kennedy assassination, and it's worth seeing only for Michelle Pfeiffer's performance as the obsessed Dallas housewife.
76022|1|The Keatons, four of them, combine to make this picture highly hilarious.
2100|1|A smart, funny send-up of the trials and joys of filming on big egos and low budgets - subjects that writer-director Tom DiCillo and his collaborators presumably know first-hand.
83899|1|"Clever, if not cutting-edge, Woody Allen's ""Melinda and Melinda"" examines whether we interpet life as a comedy or tragedy."

39977|0|After I swallowed my disbelief and gave my critical faculties a break, yeah, I was tickled every 40 minutes or so.
98849|1|Shine a Light is at once an ode to [Scorsese's] longtime muses, a look at the arc of their career, and a rollicking concert film.
27363|1|Like so much of his work, Limbo feels like two films - one agitprop, the other melodrama - but these two strains are unified in the film's title and (as always) setting.
64816|1|To isolate any one element of The Red Shoes is to miss its unique ability to convey a kind of total effect similar to that brought about by dream, or music, or memory.

2601|1|Strong cast don't entirely save this movie from itself.

47433|1|Finely crafted but more than a little overrated.
923|1|I was absolutely enthralled by the film thanks to Liam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush. These two powerful actors make Les Misérables totally engrossing.

41697|1|The remake of Dawn of the Dead is a fun, gory ride, that makes up for its lack of depth with all out action.
33046|1|None of Greenaway's films take place in anything resembling naturalism or realism, and they don't feel modern. They're like archaic storybook adaptations of Jacobean plays illustrated by Vermeer.
19561|1|Under Barry Levinson's astringent direction, Hoffman and Cruise evoke honestly earned emotions. Don't pass on this wonderfully funny and touching movie. There's magic in it.
6717|1|The plot is nothing more than a recycled version of the first one, but hey, it is still funny and there are many great lines.

84636|1|...given the skill with which this spare story has been filmed, it's hard not to be entertained on some level.
85239|1|Paul Newman's talent is large and flexible, revealing an approach to the Graziano character that scores tremendously.

21380|1|Novel and vivaciously performed.
55730|1|Clever Ealing comedy, though perhaps not as great as its legend.
73160|1|Figgis gives his dolled-up universe a high-voltage hum. And at the center of it, Gere is an extraordinarily vivid monster -- the devil as fashion plate.
98861|1|The movie gets plain silly, but at least it's lively, and young girls will enjoy Nim's lifestyle in her eco-friendly and frolic-packed tropical paradise.
11424|1|Captures authentic truth by refusing to lionize its far-from-perfect subject.
98517|1|"Although the ""hyperlink"" drama that features a lot of interconnecting storylines has become a common staple of the arthouse, ""Jellyfish"" manages to be a weird and memorable creature all its own."
59456|1|The action is as gutsy as the well-integrated score, which makes the movie's Hollywood-style gloss a little anomalous, but the basic humour and toughness emerge unscathed.

71399|1|[A] fascinating documentary...
100311|1|Perhaps the film isn't a grandiose statement of splintered lives, but it's an agreeable drama, best when it stays close to the decomposing heart of a professional liar.
10119|1|One of the greatest children's films ever.
53516|1|As always, director Stephen Frears does a superb job of work when given a good script, and this is a very good script.
32588|0|Presents the life of a madcap trickster who desperately wanted to be the biggest star in the world.
64250|1|...a case of a modest workmanlike film exceeding diminished expectations
38232|1|Sinbad is light, silly fun, and kids will probably appreciate both the skillful technique of the fantasy and the fact that the film makers have had the good sense not to include a single -- yecchh! -- kissing scene.
56222|0|The kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea.
73649|1|One of Bergman's most intense films.
97427|1|Even viewers who've never given a serif a second thought are in for an exclamation point of joy from such a well-designed doc.

19173|0|Best Picture? Wow. They had cynics back then, didn't they?
88135|1|If I think I'm mostly going to keep coming back to [the 172-minute] cut (and I do hope, someday soon, for a Mr. Arkadin-like 3-cuts comparative DVD set) it's because it feels most fully realized.
17739|0|Twilight is pure fantasy, emphasis on the pure... it's a soft-focus reverie for girls who want to be Disney princesses and have their bad boys, too, as long as the bad boys are models of tormented self-restraint.
37549|0|feels awfully conventional on the whole
50323|0|Mann gets most of the basics right but doesn't quite capture Ali's soul or spiritual growth and commitment.
54637|0|A horrible conclusion to a previously entertaining series.
75500|1|It's half a movie, but a half that hums.
3950|1|This material obviously appeals to his sense of mischief, which remains alive and well.
98433|1|...might just be the most puerile mainstream movie ever made...
37725|1|Assault on Precinct 13 is fun, engaging, and a little clichéd, but amongst the recent crop of bland action films for the whole family, it stands tall as an example of how to do one right.
1655|0|It's just not much fun to watch first time director Michael Traeger aim for Capra-esque comedy and wind up closer to crap.
59543|0|There's not a whole lot of heft to von Scherler Mayer's romantic comedy with ethnic Indian entanglements; it's like overdone naan, too flaky and ephemeral for its own good, but still somehow appetizing.

86146|0|The film remains mildly worthwhile simply due to its utter weird, sometimes beautiful construction, it adds nothing to the canon of Holocaust films or Jewish themed films
42930|0|The only contribution--and it's a dubious one--that Mirkin makes in his trifle of a comedy is to feminize the perennially male profession of con artists with a mother-daughter team, played by the regal Sigourney Weaver and sexy Jennifer Love Hewitt.
28421|1|a cornucopia of Mastroianni's recollections and philosophy
2966|0|Junior is passable entertainment, but it could hardly be called fully developed.
101194|1|What could have seemed insufferably self-pitying becomes strangely moving instead -- a sign of a filmmaker placing his absolute trust in their material and coming up all the stronger for it.
11365|1|A classic werewolf effort
32850|1|Relentless, profane, cynical and bitterly funny, this still ranks among the best work by Nicholson and Ashby. An exhilarating trip from start to finish.
95277|0|Will be remembered as the movie in which we got to see Ron Weasley utter the s-word and the f-word (numerous times); drink wine; and hook up with a Scottish hottie who introduces him to Nick Drake and sex (in that order).
66492|1|An underrated drama, highlighted by Martin's flamboyant performance.

8471|0|Robert Altman is perhaps the most unreliable of the great directors.
39149|1|"Satanic movies are a pretty silly lot, a handful of exceptions notwithstanding. The Devil Rides Out agrees wholeheartedly with that estimation... and then swiftly proves that ""silly"" and ""scary"" aren't necessarily mutually exclusive terms."
62342|0|Those who haven't fallen under the Pokémon spell will find little here to convert them.
34895|1|It lacks the punch of Dirty Harry but still makes for reasonably exciting viewing.
87768|1|It's lush, stylish and a feast for the eyes and ears rather than the heart and soul.
72900|1|Ecstatic cinema and ecstatic living join together in a pressurized promise of glory and misery, a flameout waiting to happen-and to be filmed.
56177|0|Tykwer is an intriguing filmmaker in his own right, and his creative approach to storytelling seems a bit stifled here. He sometimes reveals the same tale three different ways. While it's easy to see why he'd be eager to bring a coda to Kieslowski's legac

41439|1|In offering up this affectionate parody of the old movies, Wayans also turns a satiric eye on black culture in general -- but in an inoffensive, lighthearted manner.
99712|1|By taking the time to make that connection with the audience, The Promotion ensures we'll forgive these guys anything -- and laugh along with them -- in their quest to advance their lots.
18132|1|An afterthought, but fun to see Lemmon and Matthau again.
101371|0|Pegg tries to fill the void with antic slapstick.
27774|1|Surprise to say, the film is actually, by turns, both scary and funny, although seldom at the same time.
29544|0|Romance is explicit but not titillating
37788|0|A blaxploitation pic that's never quite as cool as its theme song.
4413|1|The result is clean, delirious, and, yes, speedy -- the best big-vehicle-in-peril movie since Clouzot's The Wages of Fear.
37686|1|Watson is hilarious in her earnestness.
22493|1|A pleasant coming-of-age film about a ten year-old female misfit and her friendship with a retarded young man.
13797|1|I might be the only person in the world who thinks Brian De Palma's 1976 classic thriller Carrie (now out on DVD) is one of the most overrated, disappointing horror films of all time, but I stand behind my review, and I swear I can knock down just about a
61619|1|Malibu's Most Wanted absconds with a simplistic but imaginative plot and elevates it beyond the realm of sketch comedy into legitimate cinematic territory - for real, y'all.
57682|0|Too much time is wasted showing how these people are joined, instead of what those connections mean and why these characters all belong in the same movie.
24153|0|Despite its G-rating, the movie includes numerous scenes of animals in peril, including a pit bull that nearly hangs himself, a crippled dog that gets thrown into a wall and a goldfish that almost suffocates... Happy holidays, kids!

21023|1|More Deco-era style than substance -- but fun.
95084|1|Holdridge is clever enough to keep his characters from slipping into outright narcissism, or when they do, he's familiar enough with the art of mainstream moviemaking to balance the exhausted with the ecstatic.
79087|1|A cine-poem ode to the rhythms of life and love set on a barge travelling along the Seine, Jean Vigo's L'Atalante stands as one of cinema's indisputable masterpieces.

66454|0|Not to be bothered with.
65059|0|Helgeland's screenplay is too lazy to investigate Washington's viciousness. This promising movie winds up spinning its wheels in a conventionally dopey action plot.
20070|0|Better than part two, and almost scary in one part.
101685|0|Glossy yet ultimately shallow, this platitudinous, unconvincing drama makes The Colour Purple look like Mississippi Burning.
8260|0|A tepid and repetitious comedy.
37148|0|Drink less [than six beers], you'll be bored with the nonsensical plot. Drink more, you'll probably vomit when you see a girl in the movie literally puke her guts out.
67822|1|This has proved to be the most influential of all the early US films and it was the first to tell a definite story.
21939|1|One of Hitchcock's final movies is also one of his goriest -- his first R-rated feature -- and most dryly funny.
26984|1|It's an entertaining and fun follow-up that definitely made good on the promise of evil doers who'd challenge the man of steel for all he's worth.

72914|1|Sharp and sharply observed period comedy with heart.
32522|1|Though deserving of its esteemed status on account of the cinematic revolution it spawned, the feature itself is something of a relic. But since when isn't it fascinating to reflect on the fossils of the past?
26507|1|The endless philosophising is a bit sophomoric and more jokes would help, but this is one of a kind that grows more absorbing the longer it runs.
72967|1|Engaging and beguiling - perhaps in spite of itself - and a vital part of film history.
34346|1|Pic belongs to Hackman, but Dennis Hopper gets another opportunity to put in a showy turn as a local misfit.
42709|1|At the very worst an intriguing misfire, and often much better than that.

38879|1|A tense and terrific thriller. Tyler is a standout.
99742|1|When Firth and Broadbent share screen time, it's very watchable. Despite their proximity in real-life ages, they're convincing as son and father.
89479|1|Plenty of artistry, even if it is a minor Altman film. So long, Robert.
91758|0|...more exhausting than frightening or funny, it is more likely to induce earache than laughs or shivers.
78637|0|"Contains momentum-halting continuity errors and clownish antics from hammy performers that will have Santa scribbling furiously on next year's ""Naughty"" list."
94677|1|Scarier and more visceral than anything I've seen in a long while.

42427|1|Beautiful and funny.
84266|0|"The center part of the film -- the country ""training"" sessions -- could have been fun if they'd been written with a satiric edge. Unfortunately, they seem to have been written with a blunt instrument."
72999|1|One of Ray Harryhausen's finest moments, the remarkable special effects are still pretty impressive even in today's CG-shaped world.

95628|1|It's a simple tale about two horny kids not only on a quest for vodka, beer and sticky fumbling, but they're looking to find themselves in the process. I'll be damned if there's many people left in the cinema afterwards who won't relate to that.

48199|1|Nothing that remarkable about the plot in itself, but De Palma employs his love of gadgetry to imaginative effect, and casts a satirically beady eye upon the money-hungry foibles of the music industry.
61241|1|It's a deeply Freudian film that happens to understand Freud--testament to its enduring, unshakable nature.
23839|1|The plot matures handsomely; the characters neatly converge and combust; the gags pay off with emotional resonance.

64624|1|This superb drama filled with spell-binding tension has not lost an iota of its considerable impact, even 40 years after it was made. Audrey Hepburn is mesmerising as the blind woman whose quick thinking is more illuminating than the brightest of lights

37177|1|[A] surreal and funny feast.
4267|0|Carrey now has the clout to find a vehicle worthy of his hyperactive gooniness. When he does, we'll see if he's truly a jester for our time or simply the moron of the moment.
2460|0|The ensuing wilderness antics are, well, sweet, bland, and shapeless.
84140|1|Amusing, touching and satisfying, this gentle yet probing little doco is a hand made movie whose simplicity and its subject matter are pluses.
59495|0|...not worth getting revved up over.
57339|0|There is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down. And that should tell you everything you need to know about All the Queen's Men.
49640|0|It's only slightly more enjoyable than having army ants gnaw at your privates.
24987|1|An unordinary, highly stylized, gritty hyperkinetic junkie movie -- unlike anything you've seen before.

86048|1|An enjoyably cheesy teen melodrama with a touch of indie edge.
65384|0|What could have been a biting dark comedy is, instead, uninspired and generic.
91893|0|"Director John Cameron Mitchell (""Hedwig and The Angry Inch"") flaunts cinematic tradition with a raucous sex comedy filled with truly shocking sex acts that underscore his vision of New York as a playground of debauchery."

76103|1|...manages to be both a serious critique of McCarthyism and a camp classic...
11654|1|Dark comedy-fantasy about cannibalism isn't for kids.
48191|1|With its climactic assassination attempt of a lovely songstress, this sardonic skewering of the music industry-as-America may be nothing less than a more rollicking, less sniffy predecessor to Altman's 'Nashville.'
27510|1|A hugely enjoyable picture that proves Joel Schumacher really can direct and that not everything about the 1980s was awful.
12268|1|Either taken alone or together with the original, The Godfather Part II is an astounding work.
95353|1|Hot Rod emerges as a daffy, dorky summer surprise, a silly comedy of non sequiturs that feels like a cockeyed collaboration between Will Ferrell and Mel Brooks.
33399|1|Jhabvala's Oscar-winning script deftly juggles the characters' romantic and financial travails, and Ivory's delicate direction manages to cut to the emotional core.

91437|1|The ensemble cast comes up smart with some fine spontaneous performances.
89577|0|Greengrass takes pains to keep events believable and relatively unrhetorical, rejecting entertainment for the sake of sober reflection, though one has to ask how edifying this is apart from its reduction of the standard myths.

46868|1|Santa Sangre has ample affection for outcasts and much to say about religious hypocrisy.
27505|0|Schumacher`s sputtering, short-term approach to the material is a disappointment, because there's something in it that ought to make for a good movie, and from time to time makes The Lost Boys good enough.

93176|0|Maybe these movies are popular, but it seems they just keep getting more inane with each variation on the theme.

7366|1|Janeane Garofalo's magnetic yet unconventional presence instantly pulls the audience into the story.

30638|0|The comic book plot meanders through a series of hardware production numbers.
32568|0|Ultimately, Any Given Sunday will disappoint football fans and won't win any new converts to the game, and worse, is just a painful film to watch
83340|0|Such a hamfisted effort that the ostensibly comic moments aren't nearly as funny as the sappily earnest serious parts.
37506|1|Its perhaps unjustified narrative shortcuts hardly seem to be much worth complaining about in the middle of its flawless action sequences.

101597|1|Zack and Miri may be a gross-out movie, but it's a damn clever one.

81723|1|Everything old feels, if not new again, at least sweet and charming.
101292|1|Seidl is a special talent, reared on documentary and determined to get near the truth with a placidly baleful eye. You are at liberty to hate or admire his work - but you can scarcely ignore it.

72650|1|Anne Bancroft is superb as Annie Sullivan, the teacher who finally reached into Helen Keller's darkness, and Patty Duke is chillingly real as the young Helen.
90049|0|This could have made a decent movie but the mythology comes so thick and fast that it mixes to a slurry as you watch.
58608|1|Fluffy, light-hearted and with a nicely comic script that sparkles with all the warm glow of an Irish picture postcard, Evelyn is an enjoyable 90 minutes of unashamedly clichéd shamrock shenanigans.
46895|1|This is a strong drama that simmers its way to a boil by the end of the film. It falters only at the very end, in which the story falls back on a cliché.

74572|1|full review at Movies for the Masses
22590|1|Working Girl, always fun even when at its most frivolous, has the benefit of the cinematographer Michael Ballhaus's sharp visual sense of board room chic, and of supporting characters who help carry its class distinctions beyond simple caricature.
82604|1|Simply superb.
71275|1|... should become a staple of film writing courses for years to come. There's not an ounce of fat in this script.
54697|1|While this is no Harold and Maude -- one of the best films about an older woman and younger man -- Tadpole has an irresistible charm.
30920|1|1987's Creepshow 2 never matches the heights of its predecessor, but those looking for more of the original's blend of throwback comic book chills and gory shocks should give this loving restoration from 88 Films a look.
31994|1|If you liked The Exorcist, The Omen, and Rosemary's Baby , don't miss this one.
54978|1|A comedy that provides serious testament to the arduous, often dreary, always imperfect work of democracy.
81789|0|Kyle MacLachlan's robust impersonation of Cary Grant is good for a laugh, but its overuse is just one of the crimes against this joyless cross-cultural gay romance.
94871|0|...focuses on a pervert who thinks he's a romantic. The more sincere this guy gets about his leering, the more he creeps you out.
10662|0|Aspires to the whimsy and fantasy of The Wizard of Oz but doesn't really capture the magic… more a fond tribute to 'pure imagination' than a triumph of it.
33990|1|Writer Steven Kloves and director Curtis Hanson turn Michael Chabon's novel into a quirky goofball pleasure.
60277|1|Meticulous Civil War story runs a little long.
73673|1|Elaborately rhetorical at the end, this 1961 film nevertheless develops its theme lucidly and with some of Bergman's most unforgettable sequences.
99470|0|War, Inc. squanders some top-tier talent (Marisa Tomei, Sir Ben Kingsley) as well as our patience.
85473|0|Uma produção correta e que prende a atenção especialmente graças à dinâmica entre Harris e Mortensen, mas que, no fim das contas, não exibe nada que a torne diferente do convencional.
55676|1|The internal and external loyalties and relationships that pull and push young Jody provide the story with its powerful conflicts.
1001|1|Beautiful, tender, hearty and poetic.
42594|0|Writer/ director Peter Hedges likes to touch on deeper emotional truths, but he doesn't have the courage to really probe his characters' struggles in a meaningful way.
25698|0|Never manages more than a glib, TV movie-of- the-week glance at their lives.
69375|1|It is definitely a treat for the eyes and ears and well worth a trip to the cinema to see.
44530|0|Suffers from predictable plotting that occasionally heats to a soap-opera boil.
34699|1|Richer, more human and more satisfying than Titanic.
13504|1|The film is supposed to be fun -- despite its ending -- and even that is an interesting departure from the über-serious tone of most epics of the time.
94041|1|First-time director Scott Frank, who penned Out of Sight and Minority Report, shapes some sharp noirish notes.
11466|0|Tired teen fare full of drinking, grossout humor.

38235|1|Brilliant stop motion monsters menace brilliantly hammy actors.
46575|1|Heckerling directs this dippy but delightful film with a light, zany touch and a reasonably low yuck-factor (dribbles notwithstanding).
560|0|A rote variation on Mark Twain's The Prince and the Pauper that is marginally salvaged by those spunky Olsen twins from ABC's Full House.
12593|1|Machines ultra-cool, humans not so cool in McG's noisy actioner.
40266|0|Nothing in this ambitious, effects-laden spectacle about family values in hell made me laugh. Not once.
10759|1|An icon of irreverent comic brilliance.
35305|1|Ultimately, a heartbreaking film that refuses to take the easy, happy route of life.
77221|0|A self-conscious, fired-up revenge fantasy that some will find difficult to sit through without offering up the occasional snort and giggle.
97756|0|Don't be duped by the steamy-sounding premise, for this dud manages to turn the prospect of swinging into a dull and decidedly antiseptic affair.
52886|1|Elevated above the usual fare by an engaging and complex relationship between its two stars, 3:10 To Yuma would be a thoroughly entertaining two hours whatever the genre - the Western setting is almost a bonus.
26449|1|This isn't great Altman but it's fun Altman.
28158|0|The film makers haven't listened to Wright. They appear to have been aiming at the same genteel audience that insists on seeing something sentimental and upbeat even in a television movie-of-the-week about AIDS.
44937|0|Like an eager kid trying too hard to be noticed, it ends up just being tiresome.
66014|1|There are no surprises in the direction, and Abby Mann's screenplay plays the expected tunes, but there's enough conviction on display to reward a patient spectator.
87096|0|Manderlay is shorter but just as dull, pretentious and condescending as Dogville.
30067|1|Nonsensical fun.
46240|1|A nonstop giggle from start to finish, this beguiling grab-bag of time-travel clichés, hard-rock music and Valley-speaking cool dudes is a flawless, purpose-built junk movie.

92119|0|A desperately lazy and unoriginal exercise.

24765|0|What could have been an interesting update of Body Snatchers for the teen crowd becomes a very bland Robert A. Heinlein's The Breakfast Club.
42139|1|Director Chuck Sheetz spins it into an enjoyable breeze. The humor regularly hits the mark, and the kid lessons are well baked.
75983|0|While Taxi is certainly full of faults that would be hard for most good actors to overcome, Fallon provides the fatal blow himself by being the least interesting part of a pretty paltry movie.

49368|0|Intriguingly straddles genres a bit, but a faint sliver of the film it could have been... [with a] lame, roundly unsatisfying motivation and ending.
36413|0|The jokes are pathetic.
42574|1|The insane storyline is just what you would expect from a deliriously appealing Vincent Price horror flick.
45794|1|There are only a couple of fresh and funny moments.
35404|0|Typically slow and stately in the later Stevens manner.
95033|1|Next to Kill Bill, this is only 50 per cent proof, but the last car chase will have you hanging on for dear life.
13466|1|It must be nerve-racking for the producers to offer a tale so lacking in standard melodramatic satisfactions. But the result is worth it, for this is the clearest film statement yet on how the nature of heroism has changed in this totalitarian century.
89713|1|It swims but it's one of those sloppy dog paddles your kid brother does more than an Olympic freestyle.
39354|1|Brutal scenes are undercut with lyricism and deadpan wit.
20246|1|The simplicity of plot, and the wide expansiveness of its use of space, are a refreshing change from the convoluted, visually cramped and cluttered second part.
16934|1|If you can let plausibility slide, this tale of two simultaneous realities created by catching/missing a train will be a fun ride.
73757|1|The pic remains passable only as a work that is all style and no substance.
6103|1|Great book, great adaptation.
9063|1|One of the greatest films of post-WWII Hollywood.
4270|1|Adroitly directed, viscerally and visually dynamic and just plain fun.
1904|1|I love Rodriguez' style, and his film is always fun. Too bad he didn't bother giving his story and characters more depth.
98080|1|I really liked this movie but unfortunately much like its lead character, played effectively by Hayden Christensen, it moved a little too fast.
52748|1|Evitando o maniqueísmo, o roteiro cria dois personagens complexos e ambíguos ao mesmo tempo que recheia a narrativa com diálogos bem construídos e instigantes.
55614|0|It is an artfully crafted exercise in high-octane style, bolstered by a stronger cast than most horror films could ever hope to assemble, but it's a bitter, sleazy little pill that leaves an ugly aftertaste.
35879|1|It's the best thing Mr. Jarmusch has done to date.
96455|1|"And what the heck does this title mean, anyway? Competing with ""Things We Lost in the Fire"" for its fuzzy appellation, ""Rendition"" refers to the U.S. policy of ""extraordinary rendition"" that allows the government to arrest and keep imprisoned anyone suspe"
56926|1|Assez bien dans l'ensemble, mais la fascinante prémise n'est jamais vraiment exploité à sa hauteur.
51413|1|Gathering its forces slowly, this careful, thoughtful film, quietly but deeply moving, is dramatic without seeming to be.
87650|1|It's brief, frivolous, and extremely entertaining even as some of it seems forced, and the film lacks the elegance of Wilde's wordplay.
77613|0|It's the worst performance by an Oscar-winning actress since Catwoman.
13199|1|Jarmusch's most accessible exercise to date while also his least seen
56797|1|Mr. Travolta is deft and vibrant, and he never condescends to the character, not even in a scene that has Tony and Stephanie arguing about whose Romeo and Juliet it is, Zeffirelli's or Shakespeare's.
36391|0|It mistakes the accumulation of odd moments for character development -- and for the most part these characters remain fairly inscrutable.
4551|1|Some good performances emerge from a one-note script via very good Russ Meyer direction and his outstanding editing.
7318|1|This is a brutally honest story that pulls no punches. It excels at everything from the directing and acting to the editing and photography. A stunning achievement
30150|1|Westerns were never the same after Sergio Leone.
77558|0|It should feel like Star Wars, yet it fails to feel like a movie at all. Conran has done his work almost too well. It's as if you're sitting in front of an outsize comic book with a speed reader as page-turner.
40651|1|Expertly executed and very funny road movie that mixes physical, verbal and situational comedy to memorable and highly likeable effect.
89072|1|How surprising that a new German film would teach Americans about human faith at a time when acclaimed movies like Borat lack faith.
84729|1|A moody sojourn into the horrific funhouse of adolescence.
4636|0|"Animated children's movies should not glamorize criminal activity and war, but that's exactly what happens in ""Open Season""..."
18683|1|Part an adventurous love story between a man and a leopard, part a metaphysical meditation about the mysteries of Nature, Lavinia Currier's feature directorial debut is dramatically inert but visually striking.
1700|0|We actually don't see very much killing at all--except, maybe, that of the careers of Morrissey and Stone.
79487|1|... it's the strange quality of non-actor Martin LaSalle that sets the film apart. Is he as dead inside as he appears to the outside world? His criminal existence alienates him from the people he cares about even as he continues to pursue it.
39422|0|At one point Vincent muses, 'It's hard to lift somebody out of hell.' Not that hard if you're stuck watching Crime and Punishment in Suburbia. Deliverance is just below the exit sign.
34548|0|Too fraudulent to work as fact; too melodramatic to work as fiction.
43311|1|there is an unexpected melancholy that raises this film . . . into the ranks of a classic tragedy
92477|0|Blood Diamond has all the cinematic punch of a lengthy Nation article.
66766|0|[Ce film] est tout ce que l'on ne veut pas voir les Coen faire dans leur futur, mais aussi le genre de comédie romantique que l'on souhaiterait voir plus souvent.
25894|1|Priceless sci-fi schlock.
45289|1|There is little logic in 'Suspiria,' just the exuberance of individual scenes.
82099|1|The picture offers a funny but frequently sad portrait of four world-class gamesters in serious need of the $25,000 in prize money.
61847|1|Here is a movie that's so good - so juicy in the dark secrets it keeps - that all I really want to say is to see it right now knowing as little about it as possible.
72739|1|one can't help laughing at at least some of the film's best gags
37174|1|...epic grandeur with unabashed heroism.
2491|1|There's a vulnerable undercurrent beneath this film, one that beats and throbs with the stolen looks, brief touches and romantic under-the-stars kisses.
100869|0|You won't understand what's going on and, even worse, you won't care.
71239|1|Una relación amor-odio incisiva en un inicio, que inevitablemente recuerda a la vivida en la inolvidable Risky Business.
46321|1|This went direct to video in Britain, but as latter-day Hollywood romantic comedies go, it has a bit more style than you might expect.
27453|0|All this less-than-ideal Husband proves is there are few folks who have the sense to leave classic text alone.
46783|1|A irresistível simpatia dos personagens eleva o filme a um outro nível de interesse.
88029|1|It has an emotional payoff. It isn't much, but by Merchant-Ivory standards it is an orgasm of raw emotion.
71566|0|It just couldn't get any duller.
10922|0|Couldn't even drag a smile out of me. Chalk it up to either old age or the calcification of taste. Or just blame it on Silverman and McCarthy, who found their careers rightfully torn to shreds soon after the release of the film.
35123|1|A perfect showcase for Robin Williams.
31334|1|For Pokemon fans? Give it a shot.
68842|1|Not for literary purists, but if you like your entertainment well tailored, then feel the quality and the width.
85789|0|"Undeveloped secondary characters and awkward pacing thwarts the movie from achieving its '60s war film ethos similar to ""The Great Escape."""
65623|0|Sickeningly violent nonsense.
72259|1|Arranged in short episodes, each composed entirely of awkward and embarassed conversation between midlevel celebs, Coffee and Cigarettes entertains fitfully.
7270|0|One bad screenwriting decision after another; it could be taught in film school as an example of what to avoid.
27823|1|"""Ghostbusters"" is a fun romp with a couple of comedy's greatest stars at the top of their game."
66893|0|While [the movie] catalogs the stormy ups-and-downs of their marriage, [it does] little to illuminate Plath's writing or her fragile mental state.
3707|0|Both a dismal farewell to the old crew and a dull introduction to the new.
1688|1|Contains one of the best cinematic swordfights ever. Incredible flick.
46274|1|Solid B-level actioner with lots of mayhem and the great Rutger Hauer.
88536|1|... a nice mix of opposites-attract romanticism with the cultural divide drama.
47411|1|"Better than ""The Opposite of Sex"", all-round good fun!"
56918|1|Showcases a pitch-black comic sensibility that will either attract or repel moviegoers.
67850|0|Comedically challenged piffle. This one hardly even seems to be trying.
80598|0|Among Carpenter's worst and that's saying something.
24574|1|As a game and as a movie, Clue is fun.

56499|1|Um olhar fascinante sobre os bastidores da comédia stand-up.
98074|0|If Jumper too often feels like a special-effects demo reel in search of a story, at least the eye candy is pretty darn sweet. [Blu-Ray]
12919|1|Fascinating early talkie that made Peter Lorre a star as child murderer hunted by all.
61524|1|[von Carolsfeld's] instincts -- to trust an audience; to be patient and poetic -- are exactly right.
73760|1|Goofily entertaining, with an amusing turn by David Cronenberg.
55140|0|An unfunny, unpleasant romance comedy entry...
7718|0|The Israeli documentary Stalags, by Ari Libsker, should be subtitled, How To Turn a Sexy Subject Into a Boring Film.
84930|1|Watching seasoned British actresses Judi Dench and Maggie Smith work together ... is visual and verbal poetry in motion.
93971|1|Even when Kravchuck lets the story drift, the boy is a solid anchor.
32159|0|Brian De Palma's take on Tom Wolfe's The Bonfire of the Vanities is a misfire of inanities.
36205|1|A wonderful, lavish adaptation of the hit musical that boasts a score of classic production numbers
89893|1|In a season of smug, telegraphed quirkiness (hello, Little Miss Sunshine), the rambling Nacho Libre, like director Jared Hess' previous Napoleon Dynamite, feels like an original.
61494|1|Ghosts of the Abyss is a beautifully rendered middle-of-the-road documentary that strikes a perfect balance between entertainment and education.
97878|0|...worthless garbage...
65012|0|Odd and banal.
70556|1|Classic blaxlpoitation film is still one of the best to come out of the genre. O'Neal gives a fine (but always funky) performance in one of the last movies before the genre ate itself and became self-parody. Terrific soudtrack.
52380|1|Contrived military school drama; down with the establishment!
31198|0|Branagh's contemporary American accent is annoying, and the film's constant inter-cutting of past and present lives becomes laughable.
97733|0|I did like the dynamic between Samuel L. Jackson and Keke Palmer. I'd like to see them play father and daughter in the better film.
54390|1|Funny, exciting, and involving.
20458|0|Marsden has blue eyes and clean-cut looks tailor-made for a Bop pinup--and all the emotional depth and acting range of the page it would be printed on.
72843|1|Damn, these guys were funny.
34390|1|[Dog Day Afternoon is] so perfectly executed that it almost feels like the wall of art is being pulled back slightly, revealing the reality of life, in all its messy, contradictory, confusing wonder.
47176|0|Fantastic drama/thriller that you may never have heard of.
66262|0|Bottom line: Good roles for the stars, nice production values, and an impressive supporting cast, but no thrills and only minor laughs.
89595|1|Snappy dialog and some prickly satire give it an edge most of these youthful romps lack.
55643|1|a fun, diverting bit of undead horror that can at the very least claim both originality and influence, as it is arguably the first horror film to include Nazi zombies
18974|1|Only because it's so awful, it's good.
29467|1|Although the film could have been a little more subtle in its moralizing, Elmo in Grouchland is certainly as entertaining as it is instructive in socialization skills.
42465|1|The film was somewhat radically reworked for a TCM special edition; the original is like an old-school monster movie that teases the audience before finally giving fans the spectacle they crave -- Elvis, tearing down the house in all his jumpsuited glory.
57807|1|A highpoint in the careers of everyone involved, Bad Day At Black Rock deserves to be ranked alongside the very best modern westerns.
86967|1|Whiteley delicately balances both Kane's newfound devotion and his more glamorous rock 'n' roll past and pays respect to both.
34351|0|Why fight it?
19808|0|This is not a fun stupid movie. This is a stupid movie that makes me want to claw my skin off.
42334|0|The whole film feels timidly improvised, and director Andrucha Waddington paces it at a numb, leaden crawl.
14824|0|[Trots] out the same tired cliches -- unorthodox heroes, inept commanding officers, officious little weasels getting trampled by the zany crew -- which haven't been funny since...well, ever.
68937|1|When mammoth dandelions puff out spores, the sight is as seductive as it is lethal.
50262|0|Sahara's biggest problem is twofold: the film's subtle ideological bent is alarming, and, in the lead, McConaughey is only just barely tolerable.
83544|1|The soulful Bruni-Tedeschi gives the impression that her beautiful face is bruised, even though it is blemish free; it's one of the best performances of the year.
100719|0|one of the most inept, poorly-mounted productions of the decade
62419|1|The tropical pleasure is a beautifully imagined adventure that beguiles children and tickles adults.
17912|1|One of Marilyn's best, a tawdry Fox melodrama.
34988|1|This is an upsetting, moving film -- not one for the weak of stomach, mind or heart.
33296|1|Though the plot has some annoying holes, the dialogue and the performances are excellent.
17055|1|Amistad is worth seeing just for people to know about this important story, this moment in history. But from the world's most powerful, successful and famous director, we expect more.
11525|1|Subtext is king in Anthony Mann's noirs, with engrossing, underlying social, political, and psychological traumas compensating for caricatural dialogue, monotonous performances, and plodding plot twists.
25040|1|A fun and fast paced piece of eighties schlock...
92081|1|An intoxicating fable about a man whose phenomenal sense of smell sets him on an irrevocable course, Perfume is a captivating, if overlong adaptation.
46283|0|The movie is more concerned with mounting big screen infotainment and sidebar issues like the lure of 'that adrenalin rush and nonstop erection of fear and war,' than making sense of the confounding stage of world history.
14464|1|Chabrol's most accomplished and popular movie in decades.

70536|0|It's not really cheese, it's Velveeta. As many who have tried have learned, midnight movies can not be manufactured, they must be discovered.
41325|0|My, my, such a high-tech setting -- too bad it's marred by such a low-tech plot.
17487|0|The film, in spite of any plot, is one sketch after another, some of which fall flat, some of which fall flatter.

91968|1|Ambitious coming-of-age drama, this may hit a false note here or there but the performances are magnetic.
27123|1|Isn't what one would call a chilling time at the cinema, but it has such a cool '80s-retro vibe to its score, its tight editing, and its gorgeous locations that it hardly matters when it falls into clunky absurdity.

79153|1|Eastwood has made a film that is thoughtful, poignant, touching, and philosophical. It stands as one of the best works in his long, illustrious career.
65784|0|Rather than deepening the mystery and sense of intoxication, the picture soon becomes one prolonged and very bad hangover.
30072|1|A cheerful and cheeky death-knell for traditional standards of well-crafted filmmaking from the previous decade.

30560|1|An ingenious blend of hand-drawn animation and live action, spliced with humour that's by turns madcap, surreal and violent, Roger Rabbit demonstrates that it's possible to push the technical boundaries while still cooking up decent characters and plots.
41298|1|Mr. Daniels's luminous performance as the heroic colonel dominates ... half of the film. And when the actor all but disappears in Part 2, he is sorely missed.
27065|1|Great plot that could have been fleshed out more.
27445|1|Parker has made a sensible cinematic translation of Wilde's play, intercutting scenes which would have been played consecutively on the stage.
33480|0|Buffy isn't funny or scary, it's just mediocre, slowly losing interest in itself as Kuzui runs out of imagination.
52672|0|...Mainly a collection of dumb sight gags, gross-out jokes, and comic sex, with a dull-as-dishwater premise and a spotty cast list.
28910|0|As an unintentional send-up of the predictability and wretchedness of modern action-comedies, Chill Factor is hilarious. Sadly, however, no one involved seems to realize the silliness and transgressive stupidity of its sub-direct-to-video-thriller script.
47863|1|This well-acted film is a nifty little change of pace.
69034|1|There are a lot of beautiful things in Beyond the Clouds: the style, the settings, the bodies of young men and women-many of them beautiful in the vaguely blank way that models are.

16778|0|The weak material is unenthusiastically played by Dustin Hoffman and downright badly handled by John Travolta...

82462|1|Can the secret life of the mind be as worthwhile as the 'real' life a person shares with others in the physical world?
49973|1|Jeunet superbly uses the film's comedic aspects to illuminate the characters, and his occasional flights of fancy only enhance Amélie's magical aura.
16573|1|In addition to its ability to be scrupulously analyzed, Fast, Cheap & Out of Control is entertaining, which is perhaps the most praised remark that can be given to a documentary.

94988|1|If this movie's concept appeals to you at all, I urge you to reward the filmmakers by seeing in the theatre if at all possible. It's so small but so special. For you zombie fans, it's a great dessert after all the carnage, but it still delivers what we

83305|1|Harmless fun for the dating crowd.

10936|1|Flashy, raunchy and schlocky, Basic Instinct is classic nineties noir for which Verhoeven's overblown direction and Stone's exposure secured a place in movie history.
59086|0|Lays grief on with a thickness that smothers.
14150|0|This 1984 film's few and unimpressive special effects evidently qualify it as science fiction, but the genre it really belongs to is the male weepie: there hasn't been a gooier buddy romance on the screen since Joe Buck took Ratso Rizzo to Miami.
68802|1|How can anyone not like the combo of Woody and Bogie in one movie?
25744|0|A highlight of 1997 Slamdance Film Fest, this raunchy romantic comedy has a nice premise--a Romeo who won't take no as an answer--but no narrative or plot to speak of, though two leads are charming and Keri Russell shows potential to become a star.
12652|0|Staged as they are here, the jokes and the fourth-wall gamesmanship don't seem as funny as they did on the page.
39673|1|It's a hipster version of Marty.
51474|0|Compared to past Farrelly movies, I found the jokes raunchy and cruel rather than funny.
14684|0|Farley might want to be like John Candy, but, while Candy knew how to make an audience laugh, Farley keeps missing the mark.
64953|0|Once the ante is upped to violence, about halfway through, the movie becomes entirely unfunny and tiresome.
13024|1|The film was adapted from a successful stage play and it comes across as very theatrical on screen, but once you get past that, there's an enjoyable lunacy to the whole thing.
60493|1|This terrific film is fueled by several scenes that are shocking -- but not for the reasons you might think. The shocks here come not from the unexpected sensationalism of them but from their bracing humanity and spontaneous, eye-opening rawness.
37799|1|Undeniably cool
97192|0|P2 doesn't have the grisly intensity of Aja's other work, in spite of a few moments of cartoonish gore.
40034|0|A high-budget spectacle of garish overkill.
56068|1|Like Rudy Yellow Lodge, Eyre needs to take a good sweat to clarify his cinematic vision before his next creation and remember the lessons of the trickster spider.
90172|1|It hits more often than it misses, and the best parts are always the simplest, in which the stars wing it with nothing to go on but their natural chemistry.
72543|1|Powerful stuff from back when Paul Verhoeven made good movies.
81896|1|The film succeeds...in fleshing out the central characters, lending credence to their personal experience of historically sweeping events
73076|1|The battle scenes are bloody, visceral, and expertly edited.
57656|0|Two down, presumably five to go, and already the franchise is entering dangerous territory: if you aren't one of the many who know their Harry Potter chapter and verse, prepare for a nap.
1661|1|Ron Howard's pop-entertainment you-are-there space thriller is easily the most rousing film of the year. And it might make real spaceflight just as nifty as Star Wars for youngsters.
85535|1|Contentious, pretentious but with a great last 20 minutes.
52490|0|However it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs, young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust.
38795|1|The outright stupidity of the production is entertaining at first, but becomes tiresome
86270|1|A silly, awkward, but sometimes very funny movie.

72010|1|I was much impressed with this superbly performed and tightly scripted noirish period drama.
96931|1|The remake/parody sequences are outstanding, but Black's all-over-the-place mania and Mos Def's bland orphan hero don't quite tie the rest of the picture together. Still, it has heart.
59458|0|The characters aren't consistent, and Cliff eventually becomes so unbelievable that we just stop caring. The movie's ending is an exercise in plot; its beginning and its music deserve better than that.
59204|1|An oddly exciting blend of tenderness, comedy and realistic despair, it touches life intimately at many points during its account of a lonely girl in a typical American small town.
43154|1|A tight and surprisingly effective murder mystery.
34176|1|Melodrama, slapstick, romance, exploitation, and psychological horror all vie for dominance throughout the film, giving it an air of fickle, feminine hysteria, which the graphic sex scene at the end of the film makes still more difficult to pin down.
21032|0|Plenty of energy has gone into making this a bustling, visually clever film with an amusing late-1930's stylishness, but the purpose of such effort is uncertain.
36456|0|A triumph of style and technological innovation, but a failure in terms of storytelling.
74263|1|What makes The Inheritance so watchable, and so different from recent couples dramas like Closer, is that these privileged people are decent, likable and struggling to do the right thing.
26284|0|Diverting but ultimately toothless and innocuous.
99285|0|"Although the film seems very proud of its clever gender bending ""twist,"" there's really nothing fresh about Made of Honor. It's a one-gag movie that wears out its gag well before the halfway mark."

100636|0|Election-year pertinence turns to mush in a winsome feel-gooder that wastes no time ramming its wholesome message down our throats. Oh, and did we mention that Kev gets to sing with his band Modern West? What a load of ballots...
87764|0|It is spendthrift in budget yet cautious in style, steadfast in holding to Lewis's imagination yet timorous about using any of its own.

99753|0|Fast-paced, well-acted and acute about sibling rivalry, the film nonetheless fails to leave a strong impression.
38530|1|The screenplay, from a novel by John D. Voelker, drips with the smoke-drenched taste of 1940s noir, stinging the eyes and lungs.
92171|1|Isn't quite as on-target as [Guest's] previous efforts, but his talented troupe again delivers more giddy laughs than just about any other comedy out there.
65572|1|Splashy Kelly production with a too-young Streisand...but she's stunning.

36968|1|A fine black comedy, not one of Chaplin's best, but still offers some illuminating moments.
67827|1|For all its flaws, Greystoke is still better than the romanticized live-action versions of Tarzan that Hollywood has produced.

77663|1|The Last Shot is a fun movie that didn't make much of a splash.
16432|1|It's concerned with the differences between the culture we profess and the lifestyles we actually indulge. Even more, it's about the consequences of betrayal.
7741|1|While Spirits of the Dead doesn't do much justice to Poe's source material, fans of bizarre French cinema should have a pretty good time.

19974|1|This film winks an eye at every horror fan, and then gives them the finger.

71778|1|It's a raw and raucous rock story that, for once, gets the big picture and the small details right.
83637|0|I was really glad when it was over.
38397|0|In Singer's dark vision, action and special effects take a back seat to message. He uses X-Men to preach a sermon of tolerance; like most sermons, it isn't much fun to sit through. X misses the spot.

74993|0|The immense sets look matte-drawn, reminiscent of the decades-old 'This Island Earth.'
16128|1|A cheerful, fast-paced entertainment that's truer to the spirit of classic pulp than, say, John Milius' brutal, mean-spirited Conan the Barbarian.

76374|0|Despite some very good acting in most roles, the people on the screen seem like types with labels.
82482|0|White Noise is a lifeless affair that strives to take our money while aggravating and annoying us, a niche already filled by the Rainforest Café.
81642|1|The story is dumb and the paper-thin characters are motivated only by the needs of the plot. But man, those action scenes!
82326|1|Genuinely funny, realistically romantic and extremely well-played
8552|1|Psychological thriller that shows the selfish and bestial impulses that lie just beneath the surface of our civilized veneer.
29092|1|An endlessly inventive picture that blends 1960s psychedelia with such diverse styles as pop art and Art Deco to create the fantastical world of Pepperland and its bizarre inhabitants.

66539|1|Cagney rocks, if indeed one can use that verb to describe a movie about George M. Cohan
74565|0|There's a distinctly deflated ambiance to the shenanigans, leaving the picture serious eye-candy on the prowl for bellylaughs it infuriatingly never finds.
33880|0|...your typical run-for-your-life-the-monsters-are-coming science fiction adventure that requires one to park his brain at the front door of the theater before entering.

82441|0|Both Rossi and Charlotte Rampling, as the mother of another young patient, do fine work. But the only surprises come at the end, too late to move us the way they should.
6577|0|Shot in the same campy style that characterized the TV show, all the cast members look like they are having a great time chewing up the scenery.
43583|1|Where Rampling really bares herself is in the emotional revelations and rawness she delivers in just about every screen.
13927|1|Well done, but so incredibly depressing that it's not entertaining.
54903|0|It's badly made, the plot is ridiculous and what's more, it confirms that Clint, like Woody Allen, is now much too old for love scenes of any kind.
63283|1|[T]he sheer amount of realized ambition on display in it makes it a sight to behold.
14322|1|oaded with wit, nifty little ideas and an extraordinary sense of design, but its allure is of quite a particular nature, much closer to that of Ed Wood than of Burton's earlier, and far more commercially successful, works.
34239|1|Speaking in a ditsy, shrill lilt that hints at concealed wisdom, Holliday slyly turns the dumb-blonde stereotype inside out.
78037|1|With Roger Dodger, Kidd knew that his strength was in creating two compelling characters, so he left everyone else in the background. This time he's stretching, and it shows.
20529|1|For-its-time state of the art effects help flat story and acting.

52842|1|A wonderfully speculative character study that made up for its rather slow beginning by drawing me into the picture.
44448|1|A sparkling new print of Howard Hawks's 1953 musical comedy, which paired Monroe and Russell at their spangled, curvaceous, lipsticky best.

21394|1|If you don't already love Sarandon, this is the feature that would do it. Director and the 2 stars mesh their talents beautifully.
96473|1|In an unusual season with so many films are aimed at adults Things We Lost may be the most mature of the lot.
65901|0|Thanks to a lack of innovation and a tired script, writer/director Hamlet Sarkissian is about as cutting edge as the out-of-touch friend who keeps trying to tell you that Michael Jackson's latest albums are as good as his old stuff.
35095|0|Clearly we are not dealing with a movie here; this is a producer's package, a market-researched gratification kit ripe for fast saturation-merchandising.

88580|0|The whole thing might be a bit more bearable were it not for the tooth-rotting sweetness of Jack Johnson's songs, which are all about learning by doing, and how important it is to have friends, and other such guff.
56541|0|Its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing.
58414|0|Eu devia ter suspeitado de algo quando meu aparelho de DVD pareceu se recusar a rodar este filme. E posso jurar que ele pediu um Cepacol depois que a tortura chegou ao fim.
51626|1|A surprising drama about the emptiness of cynicism when stacked up against the bounties of compassion.
44207|1|A rather sweet little comedy masquerading as a black comedy.
25436|1|The tempo of the film does well to cure the unlikely romance with just the right amount of anxiety and the leads -- especially Cook, who is wonderfully promising here -- create an earnestly heartfelt chemistry.
93127|0|At times I was entertained; other times, I just scratched my head.
60696|0|The self-centered brat at the center of Prozac Nation spends most of her time making life miserable for everyone around her, but there's little reason the public should have to pay for the same privilege.
28328|1|The Thomas Crown Affair is a refreshingly straightforward entertainment film, made with great style.
79582|1|The vitality Vitti displays makes her absence deeply felt in the film's infamously ambiguous final scenes.
66456|0|The story is ultimately stillborn, failing to generate much sympathy as a coming-of-age tale
56303|1|No, there's nothing intelligent here -- just a couple of likable fellows trying to stop mad Brewmeister Smith (Max von Sydow) from gaining control of the world.
9818|0|A somewhat entertaining ride to nowhere in particular.
91809|1|Field directs all this with a restraint that sometimes verges on the dry, but there's little doubt the film builds to a shattering climax.
44673|1|Dunst is so luminescent that it's impossible not to feel for her character every step of the way.
46058|0|Routine but absurd crime film.
32199|1|Art and politics collide in Tim Robbins' ambitious but not entirely successful effort to recreate a unique moment in American culture circa 1937.
100973|1|Unexpectedly entertaining, given that it's about dodgy accounting on an epic scale, the film predicts an economic cold shower that is about to douse America's prospects, thanks to its ever-expanding national debt.
47294|1|That rare film where a star and an audience get to say goodbye to each other.
71651|0|The idea of mixing the modern with the medieval is a dubious Mulligan's stew -- and annoys quickly.
42375|0|Blow Dry, the British comedy opening today, has a cast to die for, but that's about all that it has.
11649|0|What will filmmakers Jeunet and Caro serve for dessert in their next movie? Something equally daring, one hopes -- but more thoroughly cooked and a bit easier to swallow.
19736|1|a campfire boogeyman story designed to do little more than build tension and deliver a few well-timed shocks, which it does with precision and even a bit of artistry
45445|1|Score's big in the hearts of Mike fans.
50926|1|A thinly veiled look at different aspects of Chinese life clashing with each other.
94822|1|A hit and miss little film with a forced sense of eccentricity that falls flat, but is otherwise saved by hilarious one-liners...
72047|1|Although the plot is thin, there are elements that are funny.
53846|1|... a movie out of the ordinary -- especially if you like science fiction.
69692|1|Brooks's spare and reverberant film ... stands back from the actors and just lets them be with each other.
71847|0|Miracle makes a bid for epic status, but Lee throws in more elements - including murder mystery and supernatural fantasy - than the narrative can stand. The two big battle scenes are impressively staged, but the action in between sprawls and stumbles.
62327|1|Despite their missteps, first-timers Kristen Coury, as director, and writer Joseph Triebwasser create enough silliness to keep things amusing.
60960|0|Poor Cuba Gooding Jr. After his surprising and deserving Oscar win in Jerry Maguire, his career has gone absolutely nowhere.
102003|1|Suffice to say that any movie that can pack in an orgy (or the idea of one) in puritan Amish country has some merit.
99647|1|An energetic and surprisingly colorful family adventure tale that trumps formula through sheer force of personality.
26153|0|Even viewers able to get past the disturbing setup of the film's critical plot element will find an uneven mess of under-realized ideas and overdone grotesqueries.
34418|1|One of the first films to depict crime from the POV of the deviants rather than the police, this seminal film (arguably Huston's best) had a huge influence on the genre, manifest in the early work of Kubrick--and decades later Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs
13775|1|The enduring resonance of Candyman, adapted and directed by Bernard Rose, has to do with its respect for and investment in specific and real events.
100365|0|Lacking so much as one interesting creative flourish, Moving McAllister may inspire your inner-development exec to scream out script notes in the hope that somehow, maybe, the characters will hear you and give them a try.
44199|1|...a fairly forgettable piece of work that could (and should) have been so much better...
48817|1|...a taut, well-paced cop thriller with two solid adversaries in conflict.
91071|0|Computer-enhanced pictorials do most of the imaginative work in Idlewild, a wildly ambitious musical that sat on the shelf for two years, for understandable reasons.
83382|0|Joyless tedium.
76495|1|As a film replay, The Greatest Game is hardly that, but it's at least a pretty good one.
4339|1|Yearning, hilarious, lost within their precocious self-awareness, these slackers have soul.
55047|1|Crawling onto the razor's edge with bare hands, Jacques Audiard's film generates daringly uncomfortable, psychologically dangerous heat rarely found in romance of any stripe. Exhilaratingly paced, cleverly suspenseful and tastefully erotic.
8725|1|...a more ordinary movie than I remembered, with its clunky bits and a story that seems to betray authorial intent. Holly Golightly is not about the conventional American dream of domestic paradise; she is about the American perquisite of reinvention
93757|1|[The film] bears many of the hallmarks of teen comedies, but also boasts virtues not generally associated with the genre, such as wit, class consciousness, multidimensional characters, and a penetrating intelligence.
29068|0|Saturn 3 can be beautiful and impressive in scope, ambition and design but it's almost impossible to watch Saturn 3 without thinking of how much better it could have been and might have been had the film been better executed.
26972|1|Super-nostalgic superhero adventure still soars.
33675|1|This is A-grade stuff: well-plotted, unpredictable and grounded in reality from start to finish.
33624|1|decent 90s thriller
65484|0|Not an outstanding example of the genre.
55470|0|A direct hit on Jesse Jackson.
82087|1|Entertaining, informative and insightful, this is a hugely enjoyable film that stands a good chance of picking up the Best Documentary award come Oscar time.
86969|1|New York Doll is still a revelation, and a fine companion piece to End of the Century, the edgier and uglier history of another post-Dolls band, The Ramones.
72196|0|All the performers deserve better than this.
52106|1|Diamond tries his best. Olivier over compensates, but the songs are classic.
31666|1|While not the most believable of screen couples, the pair's acting chops mean you won't notice that too much while the plot chugs along at a reasonable pace, helped by some occasionally amusing gags.
17215|0|A bland limp sequel that fails to follow the act of the charismatic first film...
8121|0|The humor level is way way below the original.
73210|1|Dreamer is loaded with enough clichés and formulas to choke a horse. But truly, it works.
4309|1|The inside-baseball feel of the newsroom material (co-writer Stephen Koepp did time in the trenches) is what makes 'The Paper' sing.
45536|1|A minor skid for Donovan is sure-driving for too many others.
69558|1|The film's worth seeing for Charlize Theorn's stunning performance, based on complete physical and psychological transformation, but as a dramatic feature, it lacks an interesting perspective and is underpopulated in terms of characters.
7490|1|What could be more welcome than a classic English comedy, bristling with wit and hilarity and crammed with wonderful eccentrics?
19263|1|a watershed moment in cinema history; it remains one of the greatest films of the 1950s
89861|0|The wonder here, if not the redemption, is that so many toil so hard to make this saccharine stuff palatable.
97510|1|Perhaps the best barometer of Anderson's astonishing success here is that he manages to invest this weighty allegory with such a wealth of character and nuance.
85568|1|I went into this film not expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised.
55976|0|It's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling, regardless of whether you think Kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter.
32812|1|In the end, Stalag 17's irreverence likely didn't revolutionize moviemaking for adults so much as it paved the way for the likes of M*A*S*H and Animal House. Then again, that alone is an achievement worth celebrating.
79201|1|the abundance of talent rescues the material
42557|1|Glowing

98503|1|It's Ricci, with her princesslike innocence and Keane-painting eyes, who provides the movie's abundant charm.
19731|0|Beware of this infamous, sadistic slasher film.
76695|1|Extremely well made, this is one cult classic that justifies its reputation.
35647|1|This tale of a failing network that feeds on the mental breakdown of one of its anchors, cannibalising itself for ratings, feels as savagely relevant now as it did when it was released nearly 40 years ago.
14940|0|I saw it as a plot searching for a director.
33806|1|Filmgoers get an eye-opening look at the value placed on education in another culture, even in a poor, dusty village where crumbling chalk can be a catastrophe.
45140|1|A masterpiece (1955) by one of the most inventive and recondite directors ever to work in Hollywood, Douglas Sirk.
10176|1|If Jessica Fletcher was a witch all along, you think she could've kept Cabot Cove a little safer
63719|1|Despite the energetic efforts of Smith and Lawrence, Boys is yet another hyperventilating sequel with an inflated plot and running time.
69005|1|Chevy when he was funny, Goldie when she was starting her heyday, and Dudley too. What a deal.
96637|1|...not a genre film but...deserves mention for portraying a character who is a fan of science-fiction but is not characterized as a hopeless geek...
87508|1|Here, in her own vehicle, Silverman veers from the faux-naive mockery of minorities into an oncoming collision with white liberal guilt and condescension . . . stand-up [that] makes you sit and think.
11534|1|A wonderful, wild ride. Peter O'Toole is outstanding.
16034|1|Mel's sheepish grins, charming buffoonery and flashes of wit carry the picture to such an extent that we are generously forgiving towards the skimpy dividend that is the return for our investment.
74871|0|Preposterous, slow, and unimaginative.
65554|1|Clever, effective combination of gun violence and old-time horror movies.
5771|1|Sally Potter has made a beautiful, if decidedly wobbly, movie out of Virginia Woolfs novel about a 16th-century nobleman who evolves, across some 400 years, into a modern woman in her mid-30s. Swinton plays both male and female Orlando with cool humor.
39055|1|Some segments are marred by poor sound quality. Others produce monster laughs.
94873|1|A flair for language both cinematic and verbal elevates an ordinary coming-of-age comedy of little substance.
96109|1|"It's a testament to ""Elah's"" stoicism that the heartbreak at how dishonesty undoes decades of dignity pierces without ever patronizing. It's an unforgettable, angry film that understands several simple thank-yous can trump eruptive, emotive speeches."
83320|1|During a time in which wall-to-wall pop culture references have become the standard in animated family fare, it's refreshing to find not a single drop of irony here.
71488|0|It takes more than a couple of dirty one-liners to retain your edge in light, predictable fare.
60481|0|Staid and off-center.
23365|1|Endearing it definitely is, so much so that it's easy to overlook the simplicity, and the sly confidence trick that gets played on us.
31824|0|The screenplay, by Joe Eszterhas, does what it can to throw up a smokescreen, but the audience will probably be well ahead of the story's final resolution.
102606|1|An uneven take on Palahniuk's fourth novel, Rockwell and Huston shining brightly enough to eclipse a patchy directorial debut.
39833|0|Cheesy and obvious, but it does deliver what's promised.
57255|0|More idiotic and dangerous than the show. Really.
40847|1|Emperor doesn't aim too high or strain too hard; it is at ease inhabiting its pretty, miniature realm.
10472|0|The film is so contemptuous of its audience it doesn't even bother to present a surface resemblance to reality.

98786|1|...succeeds more as an actor's showcase than as a fully-realized, consistently compelling film.
37502|1|While it may not be as slick as Miller's other films featuring Gibson's iconic anti-hero, Mad Max still remains a timeless classic and one of the more remarkable films of its (or any) time.
41477|1|Although well cast and acted, the movie doesn't amount to much. Still, it is an enjoyable enough diversion.
33672|0|Gun Shy is worth at least a shot at a matinee.
4284|0|This movie doesn't have the wry kick of the TV show at its best. Too rich, too loaded, Maverick may have misplayed its cards, kept its eyes on the pot instead of the players. In movies, as in poker, you can't always trust a pat hand.
49502|1|Gradually it becomes clearer that, starting with Le Petit Soldat, Godard was forging his own individualistic art and becoming the most relevant director of our time.
17201|0|The measure of this film's failure is that when the nasty stuff happens, we don't laugh and we really don't care.
72633|0|It's slick packaging around what is mostly warm air.
93430|0|Infinitely more captivating for its outrageous ungainliness than a great many more proficient filmmakers have ever been able to manage.
23706|1|Sid and Nancy has some claim on being the finest British film of the 1980s.
79621|0|Not satire, but not serious, the movie chirps along with corny jingles and patronizingly 'feminist' winks at Evelyn's sugarcoated nightmare.
95272|0|Too many alcoholic outbursts and pitiful breakdowns wear down your patience.
33977|0|Sinks from pulpy crime-drama to silly gamesmanship.
34811|0|While the low comedy is undeniably effective, the film leaves behind a bad taste of snobbery and petty meanness.
44327|1|...because Cumming and Leigh avoid most (though not all) of the easy choices common to first-time writers and directors, the movie stays on the right side of entertaining.
52561|0|The Christ allegory doesn't work because there is no foundation for it
37375|1|Huston steers clear of slapstick cliché and keeps the comedy coming, right to its violently funny ending.
4935|1|A great story told by a master filmmaker; sterling actors playing some truly fascinating characters; and a bunch of cinematic set-pieces that are worthy of repeat viewings.
4714|1|A dark comedy teens will love.
48360|0|[Screenwriter Todd Graff] duplicates many of the original scenes (particularly the significant gas station ones), but does so mechanically. He jettisons most of the subtleties that made the first film so memorable.
52384|0|The much praised film upon its release, a tribute to indie filmmaking, seems to have badly dated.
51246|1|The Sandlot is just a fun, funny film that holds plenty of family appeal because it has a wholesome Norman Rockwell vibe and, as with any good sports film, you don't have to love the game to love the film.
35265|1|"There can be no better description for Modern Times-or indeed, Chaplin's career-than the film's initial title card: ""A story of industry, of individual enterprise-humanity crusading in the pursuit of happiness."" [Blu-ray]"
94572|1|Simply the most refreshing piece of cinema I've seen this year.
17635|1|Yes, it's sappy. It's also silly, utterly unironic, a sketch stretched out to feature length, and, if you're in the right mood, pretty darned cute.
25288|1|It's an unhurried film, content simply to let its lovable hero loose in New York, then watch the genial hijinks as he tries to acclimate himself to a pre-Giuliani Big Apple.
34106|0|The story jumps around too much, wasting good performances from Kinnear, Fiorentino and Goodman.
21277|0|By the end of the film, I couldn't have cared less if the town's entire population had been dragged down to Lucifer's fiery abode.
70279|0|Producer Sam Spiegel's contribution is admirable, but Elia Kazan's direction of the Pinter plot seems unfocussed though craftsmanlike. Robert De Niro's performance as the inscrutable boy-wonder of films is mildly intriguing.

28086|1|A mixed bag of occult mayhem that I remember liking as a kid.
16988|1|Director Marleen Gorris and screenwriter Eileen Atkins have done a remarkable job of suggesting the inner mental jumble Woolf strove to convey and constructing an exterior narrative of luminous beauty.
22966|1|Devi is played by Seema Biswas as a fireball of unrelenting, white-hot fury -- a slap in the face to her country and its barbaric, outdated treatment of women.
68410|1|The scenes of magic and mayhem are peppered with sly surprises, and Anjelica Huston plays the wildest wicked witch since Dorothy got back from Oz.
17823|0|Unnecessarily gloomy and emotionally convoluted, Spike Jonze and Dave Eggers' script for Where the Wild Things Are is a melancholy adaptation of the one-two punch that is the heavily illustrated, scantly written book by Maurice Sendak.
6328|1|Dated and flawed, but super cool for Val Kilmer's brilliant performance as Doc Holiday.
68017|1|Mitchum is a dreamily terrifying presence, partly because he's filmed in menacing silhouette a good quarter of the time.
76843|1|One of the best directorial debuts in recent memory.
102006|0|Sex Drive starts off well, but quickly deteriorates into a compilation of rehashed jokes that go for the lowest common denominator every time.
13366|1|The cynical view of humanity demonstrated within makes it a fascinating outlier in the writer/producer's canon and the '80s teen film generally.
87167|0|Sporadically entertaining, and ultimately pointless -- although that seems to be its agenda right from the start.
18528|1|Good-hearted story.
10236|0|Freeway is not good satire, it's not good comedy, and it's not in the least bit entertaining.
88401|1|Hopkins presides as such an engaging old coot, it seems criminal to point out flaws in the film -- which rarely tries to be more than a Kiwi version of 'The Straight Story.'
16079|0|A collection of elements rather than a distinct story, the film takes what should have been a fresh perspective on the genre and paints by numbers.
35780|1|The film is largely entertaining, often sweet, occasionally even moving.
46027|1|Dan O'Bannon's The Return of the Living Dead is a classic of the zombie genre that delivers a good laugh with its silly, over-the-top nature, while also giving you several thrills along the way.
92988|0|It's rough going when our heroes have us longing for the complexity of the riverboat crew from 'Anaconda.'
49506|1|Interesting historically, much less so artistically.
16609|1|This is a thought-provoking film, an effective wake-up call to those who glorify science.
2804|0|Because Carlo Broschi, the 18th-century castrato singer known as Farinelli, was himself such an exotic and sensationalistic figure, you'd think that creating a dull movie out of his flamboyant life would be next to impossible. Think again.
27666|1|Tight, ingenious!
30286|0|While julien donkey-boy is neither bourgeois nor romantic, it is often unsettlingly funny, though it ultimately recedes into a dark womb of despair.
70165|1|Still, with all its usual Capra faults, it holds up as a slightly above average breezy newspaper comedy.
89934|1|A fascinating film with an unresolved comedy/tragedy axis
70191|1|The most fascinating aspect of this film is the dedicated training that turns average-built young men (frequently they refer to themselves as weaklings in their early youth) into superbly-created physical edifices.
34773|0|Whereas the material begs for the off-stride touch of a Jonathan Demme, it is sabotaged by Scott, who seems to have little affinity for whimsy.
60475|1|Reflects Roeg's views of the absurdity of American history and our compulsion to destroy beauty. [Blu-ray]
70830|0|Luis Estrada, the co-writer and director, uses his characters so clearly as symbols that he neglects to give them the complexity of human beings.
84916|1|A character-driven mellermeller that's a treat for the eyes, with performances to match, Parineeta is high-end Bollywood near its best.
46065|1|It's an assembly of sensational moments, strung together by a plot that provides the excuses for amazing stunts, and not much else. But then not much else is needed.
505|1|For children, the movie will play like a storybook come to life. Adults, at first, will marvel at the special effects and puppetry. But ultimately, they'll be won over by the nuances of a story that finds a fresh way to deliver a timeless message.
68723|1|Stlick, stylish and ineffably cool, this was perhaps McQueen's defining role. Also mention goes to the uncreditied star of the film; San Francisco.
78540|1|Like Big Fish and The Neverending Story, this is a film that reminds us that life, coloured by our perceptions, is what we make it; all we have to do is believe.
26274|1|The same Hollywood that brought us the vision of The Marquis De Sade as 'champion of free speech' earlier this year in Quills, now brings us the positively lovable bank-robbing duo of Bandits.
9851|0|A truly disgraceful outing that amounts to little more than an unbelievable Steven Seagal self-love fest.
16389|1|Blistering film version of the novel. One of Schlesinger's best works.
65758|1|A wholly unique family film that can moisten your eyes even while it quickens your pulse.

63916|1|"Basis for ""Waltons"" TV series with great scenery, family drama and comedy...and Henry Fonda."
55196|1|A daring drama that addresses how a wanton woman copes with a strict social structure that would deny her any outlet for her animalistic urges.
2756|1|An engaging and graceful comedy
50670|1|This film has smoky atmosphere, medieval sets, and rugged terrain strange enough to suggest far-off mythic lands; moreover, its special effects are positively staggering.
11571|0|A goofy, goodwill gesture toward the U.S. Postal Service, it's never funny and moves slower than an unaddressed letter without postage.
38697|0|If the movie ... exhibits a loving eye for Manhattan exteriors, it's undone by its own rigidly old-fashioned conventions.
18062|0|A galactic slump of a movie that stuffs its travel bag with special effects but forgets to pack the charm.
18233|1|Oldman creates an uncanny documentary feel for his fictional story that draws you in despite the misery unfurling onscreen.
74625|1|Hooper's unrelenting assault on the senses is one of the most streamlined, sadistic horror movies ever made.
62185|1|101 Reykjavik sometimes seems to be drifting pointlessly, but it keeps on righting itself, with moments of humor and imagination.
93985|1|With a riveting performance by young Kolya Spiridonov as the six year old Vanya, The Italian is a bitter sweet drama that captures the heartbreaking squalor of Russian orphans while highlighting the power of the spirit.
37106|0|Lawrence isn't doing anything that hasn't been done before, and he's certainly not doing it any better.
70589|1|A surprisingly worthy addition to the blood-sucking genre.
42263|0|The main problem with the movie has to do with several jolting moments of violence.
86801|0|Esta cinta ya la vimos...aún antes de entrar a la sala.
13658|1|The Amityville Horror is just another decidedly bland, but mildly entertaining, horror film churned out in the rush to cash in on the reemergence of horror in Hollywood.
4586|1|Visually striking, with two astonishing lead performances, but it never quite plumbs the emotional depths of the Truman Capote source material.
30382|1|A abordagem de imersão adotada por Herzog, somada à performance intensa de Kinski, resulta numa experiência única e inesquecível.
10486|1|The film has its period down cold, but what makes it special is its nerve, about which the best you can say is that it matches Hardy's own.
27691|0|It is easy to be interested in these people because they are so much like us. But is it enough to keep us from hitting the channel changer looking for distraction?
12757|1|8 1/2 is one of the great films about filmmaking.
13599|1|Through a complex narrative technique and stunning imagery, the movie ... slips behind the mask of invincibility to portray a woman plagued by self-doubt and anguish.
61754|1|Chock-full of hilarious performances.
102076|1|With Three Monkeys, Nuri Bilge Ceylan trains his cool, detached sensibility on a ripe and pulpy melodrama that might have originated in a James M. Cain novel.
40715|0|The sensibility of this movie is so adolescent that it's hard to take it as seriously as the filmmakers intend us to.
35101|0|Pulpy and dramatic mystery-thriller.
38459|0|A country-club member takes a club employee under her wing in this cagey formula thriller that exploits homosexuality better than murder-mystery clues.
71155|0|Frankly, you'll find much better works from the Merchant-Ivory collection.
83037|0|As forgettable as a Hollywood couple's marriage vows.
75170|0|Wait: When you sleep with a teenager that could have an impact on your marriage?
71526|1|A dandy entertainment which has some shrewd and realistic things to say.
18961|1|"""This isn't like plans one through eight. This is plan nine, the one that worked! The worst movie ever made!"""
61641|1|Winged Migration must be the most subversive G-rated film ever.
78380|1|Wholly absorbing... subtly trapping us in the perspective of a beleaguered protagonist, who himself is trapped in an inchoate state of grief and fantasy.
8599|0|Perhaps the first Michael Mann film to almost completely lack a human element; or rather, the human element it possesses is thin and unconvincing.
75293|1|In this very personal portrait, Davies, the artist, has re-created universal experiences -- familiar passions and needs -- that draw us to his family's humanity.
7889|1|Caan's character is great, Robert Pastorelli's ex-wiseguy is enlisted to help and provide a little stereotype comic relief and Arnold makes a mid-air exit from an airplane that makes for one groovy action sequence.
55715|1|Charles Crichton's direction is subtle but inventive - check out the snaking, near-single-take opening in a Rio cabana - and the performances, writing and plotting are faultless.
15655|0|A movie that is blessedly bad enough to ensure that there will be no Speed 3.
65736|1|You may not be dancing in the aisle, but at least you won't be tempted to flee the theater.
6219|0|...stripped of its thriller elements, the movie is really just a subpar 9 1/2 Weeks clone...
54344|1|In Anthony Drazan's enjoyably offbeat Zebrahead, racial definition is the least important thing about anybody.
72502|0|It's quite 'agreeable,' as the fatuous Mr. Collins would say, but there's something disturbing about a Jane Austen adaptation that uses an ampersand as an official part of its title.
60338|1|A guy's flick whose charms are many and faults are few.
53753|1|Tom Clancy franchise gets a surprisingly satisfying reinvention thanks to star Ben Affleck and director Phil Alden Robinson.
56223|0|You could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time.
22851|0|Mamet was so upset by the Writers Guild's refusal to give him sole writing credit that he chose to be listed under a pseudonym; turns out he unwittingly made the right decision.
24707|1|A jaw-plunging blend of physical dexterity and bravura moviemaking.
13728|1|A sublimated ghost story related with all surface seriousness and above all with a remarkably effective background of creepy atmosphere.
71476|0|Unfortunately, we're not given much reason to care about this mopey bore, and I found my mind wandering as it did in a previous Icelandic film, Reykjavik 101.
89800|1|One of these days, the magicians at Pixar will make a bad movie%u2013or even a mediocre one%u2013but it hasn't happened yet.
53438|1|Walt Disney Studios continues to make films that old Walt would have been proud of.
54173|1|"Vigorously entertaining and tremendously weird, ""Minority Report"" feels like a vintage Action Comics adventure spiked with acid. It's an uncommonly melancholy blockbuster about demons ruthlessly determining our fate even as we relentlessly flee them."
34912|1|Everything is about winning respect versus earning it. This film earned mine. I'm glad I took a chance on it. By the look of my theater, not many others did.
559|0|It's not a bad little time-waster for the kiddies.
22354|0|Stagy and verbose, this British play adaptation is one of the few weak movies Hitchcock had made in an otherwise brilliant career.
54747|1|Slowed down to a nightmare crawl, it's one of its director's most bizarre, resonant and fascinating films.
96846|1|It feels familiar, even Washington's performance of real-life Frank Lucas feels like something we've seen before.
77475|0|The film bogs down too much and too often to be entertaining...
80096|1|John Carpenter's super-low-budget sci-fi pic gets a really slow start but becomes tons of fun for its last couple of acts.
73726|1|The movie belongs to Finney, but mention must be made of Jacqueline Bisset as his wife and Anthony Andrews as his half-brother.
3945|0|Strong playing by topliner Peter Coyote can't compensate for a script that's all over the map and a tone that veers from outre comedy to erotic game-playing.
89758|1|Exciting and filled with edge of your seat action that gripped me until the very ending.
48480|1|This amiable -- albeit predictable -- film eventually gets its groove on by mining the comedy of this offbeat ensemble.
21829|1|An education in cheap, easy laughs.
69550|1|Far from an anti-war film, Two Men is more in line with In Which We Serve (1942) than Oh! What a Lovely War (1969).
58755|0|This is a dark, depressing, excessively violent, profusely profane film, not for the squeamish or anyone who likes elevating entertainment.
14589|0|There is never enough reason for the audience to care about these people, and everyone speaks in circles when some straight-up conversation might be better.
94680|0|More of the same, with decidedly mixed results.
18563|0|The plot of this tear-jerker is a little heavy-handed, and so is the directing by Forest Whitaker.
55015|0|The movie is gorgeously made, but it is also somewhat shallow and art-conscious.
75460|1|Charming, quirky little comedy with standout performance from Rockwell.
73349|0|Laure is uptight, slightly vacant, often confused. That the film becomes slightly surreal in the second half doesn't help.
75196|1|The film is promising and wonderful, needing only a very few minutes' editing down.
46916|0|The Pryor/Wilder magic is nowhere to be seen or heard here.
59911|0|Sour and pointless.
9226|1|Humdrum remake of Tracy classic, but has its moments with Steve Martin.
32046|1|Bava displays how ahead of the curve he was in tackling the slasher genre.
73627|1|Woody Allen's Zelig (1983) perfected the fake documentary a year before This Is Spinal Tap.
60736|0|Strikes a melodramatic, soap operatic tone...doesn't penetrate deep enough to touch a raw emotional nerve.
36897|1|And you can dance to it...
86614|1|To narrate selected details from this journey from the Iron Range to Greenwich Village to Rock Star Babylon, we get generous, attention-span respecting clips of Dylan performances and reminiscences from carefully selected talking heads.
102512|1|... A beautiful, heartbreaking film ... packed with tender, loving performances and some of the most astounding visual effects we have ever seen.
19658|1|Whit Stillman's crafty independent feature about wealthy Park Avenue teenagers and a middle-class boy who joins their ranks over one Christmas vacation is certainly well imagined, and impressively acted by a cast of newcomers.
37761|0|Lots of dull spots, a few effectively intense moments, and as much gore as the monster genre usually calls for nowadays.
85909|1|... a beautifully photographed journey that will thrill youngsters and strongly engage adults.
76692|1|this is a small but perfectly formed black-and-white masterpiece of flash and trash, unwholesome obsession and criminal daring.
40679|0|So very little works in She's Having a Baby that it's easiest just to grouse on how petty and little-minded and pro-conformity it is.
7588|0|Yet another Leslie Nielson movie parody, targeted this time at James Bond pictures and their many spinoffs.
16599|1|One of first Hollywood films about the effects of genetic engineering on human conduct, Andrew Niccol's directing debut is an intelligent and timely sci-fi that, despite some illogical plot contrivances, is emotionally engaging almost up to the end.
21723|1|This zany comedy written and directed by Tamara Jenkins is filled with humorous takes on sexuality in the 1970s.
44889|1|Basically just a bunch of silly spoof scenes cobbled together around a thin premise, it allows the Wayans brothers to have fun in the way a group of kids might have fun with a video camcorder, except with a multi-million-dollar budget.
18645|0|Think of a 'Romancing The Stone' and 'African Queen' with just a trace of the sexual politics of 'Swept Away' thrown in. Now lower your expectations -- drastically.

65215|1|Mehta manages to make her film not only palatable, but a real pleaser.
66460|0|Overly schematic and the least effective screen adaptation of a David Mamet play.
92|1|This is glandular, not intellectual, movie-making but it's at the highest end of technical expressiveness.
89906|1|It's more outrageous than hilarious, yet Nacho Libre has the same kind of sweet poignancy its filmmaker Jared Hess brought to his 2004 cult hit Napoleon Dynamite.
77960|0|Shot for a begged and borrowed $7,000, 'Primer' looks it: grainy-ish, fuzzy on details and effects, acting running the gamut from A to B, and clipped incomprehensible technobabble for dialogue.
46848|0|the gayest thing next to a gladiator movie
66910|0|Has its virtues, but they're the kind you can buy.
61326|0|This is a revenge thriller that for long stretches forgets about the revenge and, more importantly, the thrills.
80548|1|Playful comic-horror is a fine diversion. Consumers, beware!
49247|1|A testament to why blockbuster junkies like me should turn off the Dolby digital and turn on the IFC every now and then.
90095|1|You almost have to laugh and go along on the wave of ridiculousness.
92237|0|Arnett underplays to the point where he seems as shellshocked as his character, while Shepard seems to have forgotten that the film is supposed to be a comedy.

27179|1|Picture has been smartly fashioned to take advantage of all the tricks of science-fiction and 3-D.
37272|1|What makes Eraserhead great -- and still, perhaps the best of all Lynch's films? Intensity. Nightmare clarity. And perhaps also it's the single-mindedness of its vision.
47463|0|A great setting in search of a decent horror film to fill it.
32764|0|Light on originality and low on suspense.
53185|1|It's the intellectual ride of your life, as far as moviegoing goes.
59511|0|Ali Larter is a fine performer and all, but when she's the big celebrity guest star of a movie, you know there's desperation in the air.
5795|1|Jonathan Demme's thoughtful human drama was certainly not the first movie to confront the AIDS crisis, but it was, even in the conventional skin of a courtroom drama, the most heartbreaking and passionate undertaking of its kind.
4024|0|Lee is a great self-promoter. After all his press releases and all his interviews, we are given films that are sketchy, unfelt and distancing -- incidents in Lee's career, the only drama that really interests him.
27|1|A visually impressive and exhilarating adventure that keeps the suspense, thrills and comedy running high through the surprising end and supplies interesting characters with moving plights that keep the audience rooting.

76985|1|Like Danny, the movie seems up for anything, and that relaxed joie de vivre charms in the movie's second half.
82477|0|White Noise is little more than an old-fashioned ghost story with a newfangled twist.
91945|0|Writers William Broyles Jr. and Paul Haggis believe that they are contrasting the men's lives with their heroic image. Sadly, what they present to the viewer is yet another fabricated image, and one that is equally false.
69294|1|'Un buen trabajo fílmico que vale la pena disfrutar por sus valores técnicos, estéticos y actorales, que son muchos'

45739|1|If Corey Yuen believed in truth in advertising, ala Snakes on a Plane, this flick would have a name like Jiggly Babes Kick Butt. The stuff that post-pubescent dreams are made of.

15972|0|Not quite bad enough to call rancid, and that's the best I can say for it.

37676|1|A number of the actors surprise and beguile.
8974|1|One of Hollywood's most astonishing achievements in Technicolor.

32675|1|Morris provides plenty of evidence to refute Leuchter's conclusions, but he is more interested in the character of Leuchter himself, and in the workings of Leuchter's mind - which, when all is said and done, remain as mysterious as they ever were.
35392|1|One of the great studio dramas of the period and one of this column's favourite films, with haunting performances from Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift.
33974|0|I wish I'd had a stopwatch, to clock how many minutes are spent while one character holds a gun to another character's head and gabs.
26129|1|Irons gives a highly accomplished performance in a chilly knife-swapping psychodrama that remains among the director's leanest, meanest releases.
44112|0|Baseball fans might find this marginally absorbing; for anyone else it's as conscientious and stylistically pedestrian as Sayles's other films, and a mite overlong to boot.
18155|1|As brilliant and perplexing as the filmmaker himself.
94328|1|[Actress] Reaser is no slouch in the emotionally befuddled whirlwind department. In the end, it's all la dolce vita no matter how you look at it.
49348|1|Although it suffers nominally from being over-stuffed and under-paced, it's grand and involving, with magnificent production design and special effects, and some fabulous thesps present and correct.
70400|1|"""Touching the Void"" towers above the rest of that rarest of all film genres, the docudrama."
102430|1|If Winslet carries the complex psychological intrigue of the film on her shoulders, David Kross carries the heart of it on his.
77587|0|Breillat reduces sexuality to the basest coupling of body parts, and Anatomy of Hell reduces film to freak-show voyeurism.
52817|0|Female characters should be allowed to engage in raunchy humor on the big screen; they already do on the small one with Sex and the City. But unlike that HBO series, The Sweetest Thing has no guts.

24588|1|By the time Young Sherlock Holmes clangs to a close, the assets of the film are buried beneath an avalanche of unnecessary bells and whistles.
28040|1|Truffaut's masterpiece is one of the best dissections of that uniquely French concept, menage a trois, with a definitive performance of Jeanne Moreau at the center; his love for the film medium is evident in every frame of this tragic yet giddy romance
26945|1|Campy skewering of Hollywood star is both silly and sad.
66583|0|"In an attempt to find the origins of infamous gangsters Charlie ""Lucky"" Luciano, Meyer Lansky, Frank Costello and Benny ""Bugsy"" Siegel, Karbelnikoff has rendered lame caricatures instead of meaty characters."
30611|0|He may look the part, but Timothy Dalton fails the boots, the scuba gear, or the automobiles left him by Moore and Connery.
75942|1|James Cagney is in top form as a gangster with with redeeming qualities in this well-directed, Oscar nominated picture from Michael Curtiz, who scored in 1938 two Oscar nods; Bogart and Raft are also good.
75490|0|Turturro's clammy, lumpen Cain is a profoundly disagreeable guide down the rabbit hole of hallucinatory paranoia.
93311|1|At half the length it would have been twice as good, but nevertheless it stokes a nostalgia some may have for a magic period in Miami history when it was ever so briefly the American Casablanca.
5319|0|Nope, not even bad enough to be the final installment.
99073|1|Surprisingly a lot of fun, with a simple good vs. evil plot, nice action sequences and a battle of the ages between two of the biggest martial art movie masters.
21871|1|Davis is the main attraction of the movie. She looks like a delicate flower, but she's smart and sarcastic!
12573|1|Charming cross-cultural tale about some outsiders from a Texas oil company whose visit to a small Scottish town changes everything.
48167|1|"It may be a true ""chick flick,"" but as far as those movies go, you could do a hell of a lot worse."
12030|1|To appreciate the film fully, Lawrence must be seen in a cinema, in 70mm on the widescreen and in stereophonic sound, and the present theatrical revival is not to be missed.
29397|0|It just doesn't flow, giving the feel of too many writers and/or directors.
9623|1|There's a brute force in Night of the Living Dead that catches one in the throat.
97734|0|It's not that Cleaner is a terrible film, it just doesn't rear back and sock the viewer in the jaw like a great thriller should. It's mild sauce from the first frame to the last.
100912|0|Depressingly for a film written by two women, it's relentlessly sexist in its insistence that, in order to attract men, women must appear brainless and dress like a hooker.
8833|1|Smoothly troweled and thoroughly entertaining.
11889|1|Jack Nicholson plays McMurphy as if he were born to it, and the supporting cast provides fine, detailed performances.
46544|1|quirky but fun comedy. Dreyfuss is charming as the compulsive gambler.
21482|1|Hilarious and heart-warming, this is a real crowd-pleaser for all ages.
68371|1|Godard frames and edits his shots, moves the camera, uses music, and deploys his actors in ways that still seem radical -- even as several generations of directors since have cribbed and stolen from him.
77611|0|ends up underwhelmingly episodic and contrived
48138|1|Neeson delivers a typically compelling performance in (for him) an atypically muscle-bound role.
95520|0|[F]eels like little more than an amalgam of great moments from the John Hughes oeuvre as well as from Thumbsucker, Pump Up the Volume and Over the Edge, among others.
100440|1|The most moving story about love, longevity, infidelity and the Holocaust you may ever hear.
101572|0|Based on a Finnish shoot-em up video game, Max Payne is all style and little story, cheerless detective Max (Mark Wahlberg) drifting through a washed out and snowy New York in search of his wife's killer.
46994|0|The film looks like the sort of queasy fever dream that might be produced by sitting through an entire Orson Welles film festival while eating pepperoni pizzas.
79386|1|Unfaithfully Yours (1948) is a wonderful, brilliant and stylish comedy by Preston Sturges - it was the last of his Hollywood films.
67604|0|At two hours and even with the rushed feel it still feels overly long and worst of all -- cheap.
52608|0|Amateurish, ineptly written, poorly acted and crudely directed.
7093|1|The past may all be just a pack of lies, the film suggests, but after everything's gone to pieces, it's hard not to feel nostalgic for something.
97970|1|It's one of the best films about women you're likely to see this year.
46445|1|Has real heart. Lahti gives a poignant performance
37223|1|One of the better war films.
93048|1|It's the kind of high-school movie about kids and music that Hollywood would never be able to capture with such intimacy, nuance and restraint.
81227|0|I couldn't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy.
58035|0|Strange, is it not, how the regular bombardment of thrills can have quite the opposite effect of the one intended.
46774|0|It's all very sweet, but the film goes in too many directions.
65490|1|The fight scenes are the main attraction, of course, and the film delivers the goods again and again.
10938|1|Trailer trash Hitchcock spliced with overboiled film noir.
42585|0|A charming, though occasionally off-target -- and consistently tempo-challenged -- romantic comedy.
55697|0|That sophisticated stride that made [the Coen Brothers'] first run of films so remarkable has here degenerated into a sophomoric stumble.
35270|1|The picture is grand fun and sound entertainment, though silent. It's the old Chaplin at his best, looking at his best -- young, pathetic and a very funny guy.
75847|1|A fevered yet clinical study of jealousy, Leave Her to Heaven is probably John M. Stahl's best-known film.
28523|1|Even though the mix contains lumps, Cat's Eye is the best screen adaptation of any King work since Brian De Palma's Carrie.
97610|1|Razor is filler, but good filler
17901|1|In this brilliant and incisive drama, the filmmakers reveal the shadow sides of American politics.
13372|1|A simple, lovely and thoughtful teenage story that occasionally shines due to fine characterizations and lucid dialog.
82694|1|Sigourney Weaver gives a terrific performance in this impressive film.
47564|0|After enduring only a few minutes of this shrill debacle, you'll feel more trapped in the theater than Jimmy is by his bubble.
74975|0|The question is supposed to be, 'Who is the killer?' The question that actually emerges, though, is 'Why we should care?'
84714|1|A psychological drama that registered with audiences and critics alike because of its heartfelt painful story.
80980|1|Harsh, funny, repellent and occasionally quite moving.
37907|1|Lumet's biopic of Frank Serpico, the virtuous cop who exposed a network of graft in the NYPD, feels depressingly relevant.
66366|1|A stunning teen angst/werewolf film from 2001, this was the best lycanthrope movie since An American Werewolf in London.
34454|1|Damn, this is Wayne's movie.
98821|0|It strokes every personal ideal, whatever it is, rather than aligning itself with its characters and letting the conclusions arise out of who they are.
85194|1|LaChapelle's powerful street-dance documentary Rize never lets us forget that its subjects are dancing in a war zone. But dance they do, in a kind of controlled frenzy, with music throbbing and limbs whirling and swaying and pulsing to the beat.
66968|1|Harris puts in a believable and focused performance.
47993|1|The conflict between the 'sausages and peppers' father and his 'lobster in shallot, champagne and vanilla bean sauce' son is just one of many juicy threads running through this Altman-esque banquet.
76140|1|Isn't quite the bullseye Moore's supporters are hoping for and Bush's supporters are dreading.
4159|0|The plot would all mean something if Singleton offered his characters any engaging conflicts--they all seem recycled from movies of the week.
34594|0|A sex farce with flat characters trapped within '80s sensibilities...
13633|0|It's a failure, less because the odd stylistic mix doesn't take (it does from time to time, and to striking effect) than because Landis hasn't bothered to put his story into any kind of satisfying shape.
8124|1|As a satire of a sitcom that wasn't funny, it's often at its funniest when it's purposely stale.
83489|1|More like a cartoon populated with human actors.
56702|1|Obviously, it's an odd premise. But director Aleksandr Sokhurov does have fun with it.
15216|0|Apallingly bad. Robert Townsend's attempt at satirizing black culture is far off the mark.
23989|1|I wish Jackson would shake off his addiction to gigantism, his apparent need to punch everything up three times as much as it needs to be.
47891|1|Cuesta has succeeded in making a clear and captivating narrative involving the issues of trust, loss and deceit, all of which take place within the space of a week.
60802|1|A remarkably engaging movie, mostly in spite of, rather than because of, its metaphorical aspirations.
14880|1|The humor is implied but never over-explained, imparting a sense of intelligence rarely achieved in movie comedies.
50890|0|This horrific teen romance-cum-weepie is best watched from between your fingers, or from under your seat, or perhaps standing outside the cinema looking in the opposite direction.
43927|1|No matter which level of the movie a viewer responds to, anyone past the age of 5 who doesn't laugh repeatedly while seeing Shrek needs to have his funny bone examined.
17329|1|Directing himself for the first time, Redford has lavished his usual meticulous care on popular material that comes alive on the screen in ways that it never could on the page.
5712|1|Leigh's extensive use of improvisation in rehearsal led to a razor-sharp final script, endlessly blooming with memorable dialogue that—while never less than credibly naturalistic—proves thematically fertile. [Blu-ray]
33668|1|Gun Shy is the kind of movie that makes you laugh; then, as you think about it afterward, you feel ashamed you enjoyed it.
71416|0|Michel Gondry tries to channel Fellini and ends up irrigating faulty plumbing.
87365|1|Low-budget horror doesn't get much better than this.
13084|1|George C. Scott's performance cannot be praised highly enough for capturing both the violence and the vulnerability of the Patton personality without degenerating either into vulgar caricature or cardboard sentimentality.
69133|0|This was Cassavetes' attempt to make a film with more commercial elements, but the melding of a conventional narrative with his own abstract musings doesn't completely work.
63127|1|Fun meet-up of Rugrats, Wild Thornberrys on deserted island.
60018|0|A half-baked, rather retarded parody of Carrie and a number of other films that, using the awesome power of their ignorance, drove telekinesis into the ground.
4300|1|Absolutely superb.
52690|0|A prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell.
14580|1|Gets down to dramatic business, transcending age and gender considerations to make May a poster woman for the philosophy that everyone's life path is their own business to determine.
17632|1|Although the movie is remarkably schmaltzy, it's sweet and affecting, too, with Sandler's character as genuinely nice as he can be.
91507|1|Sometimes stiff but fascinating biopic
1919|1|Sheer pleasure.
16499|0|"[Director] Gillespie is there to give fans a poor man's ""Scream"" and he pulls it off."
86120|0|...ultimately unsatisfactory...
92730|1|Like the Swedish/Norwegian Kitchen Stories, it's a thoughtful Scandinavian film with a bent sense of humor.
21946|1|a devilishly clever Hitchcockian caper
8743|1|Technically well made, but there are a plethora of more entertaining Hitchcock films available.
29751|1|Steamy, explicit and highly-charged film noir reworked with an 1980s gloss.
47104|1|A whole lot of fun...just forget the sequels.
37005|1|Lancaster is unparalleled in a rare bad guy role, helped amiably by a solid supporting staff. One of Frankenheimer's best works.
73799|0|"Pornografia infantil disfarçada de ""arte""."
85282|1|March of the Penguins is a staggeringly beautiful film about the breeding cycle of the toughest birds on Earth, the emperor penguins of Antarctica.
44867|1|The formulaic story cannot weigh down the high-flying, visceral excitement that the film offers in generous doses.
89172|1|Like Au Hasard, Balthazar, Mouchette is a deeply pessimistic film which somehow leaves one in a mood close to exhilaration.
81531|1|Part character study, part action flick, the film seamlessly blends genres in an extremely satisfying way. The photography is spectacular - of particular note is a Escher-like staircase sequence that is simply extraordinary.
46936|1|This witty, buoyant comedy explores the wild strategy a middle-aged Liverpool matron comes up with to love just being herself.
66605|1|The foursome of actors, especially actresses Yuan and Kim, fill their portrayals with a smoldering, sometimes desperate, yearning.
7112|1|Mike and the droids are adept at poking fun at the bad movies they're forced to watch by evil scientist Dr Forrester (also played by Beaulieu), though This Island Earth is cut above the vast majority of films featured on the original TV show.
46162|1|Matthew Broderick shows his versatility and might as an actor here
40693|0|This was Timothy Dalton's debut as 007 and it was already pretty clear that he lacked the necessary ironic touch that made the credibility-straining action seem fun rather than ridiculous.
53078|1|An Argentinian, Mamet-like confidence-game movie.
2868|1|Stylish and eerily compelling before it overplays its campy excesses, Heavenly Creatures does have a feverish intensity to recommend it.
63384|1|A top social drama, inspired by the real Bonnie and Clyde. Lang is in prime directing form.
56998|0|Crude, tasteless exploitation footage. Filmed carnage. Be ashamed to watch this garbage.
8603|1|No one, but no one does crime like Michael Mann.
10520|1|É impressionante a capacidade que Woody Allen tem de surpreender até seus fãs mais fiéis.
19608|1|Not really good, but interesting early Allen.
83795|1|Hawks was gifted above all at this kind of fast-paced farce, and somehow made it work without the aid of padding or rest periods.
38160|1|The Merchant-Ivory team ... tackle Henry James' dense, complex final novel and pull it off with decorous poise.
58598|0|Did director Bruce Beresford have to ratchet up the saccharine of an innately sentimental story?
92448|0|"Merece ser ignorado por ser péssimo, não por ser uma ""visão preconceituosa"" do Brasil."
76557|1|Perhaps the most successful of the three Philip Roth adaptations on the big screen.
2635|1|One of Francis Ford Coppola's great movies that slipped through the cracks in the late 80's.
14929|0|Obviously, someone must have told Leguizamo he's a comic genius. Whoever did that isn't his friend.
16434|1|This is a cold and calculating film that will temporarily dampen those fond memories of everything we cherish from two decades back.
74746|1|Mastroianni and MacLaine are both fine, but the film is a little too cutesy for its own good.
90372|1|Ride along to dysfunction in quirky indie comedy.
57743|0|manipulative tear jerking moments are far too familiar
101808|0|Some movies go off on tangents. This movie is nothing but tangents.
86642|1|An understated and atmospheric portrait of the artist as a young booze-hound built around a quiet but magnetic performance by Matt Dillon.
73295|1|A strong sequel with a most unusual villain.
46270|1|A satisfying action vehicle for Hauer...
91166|0|Yet more self-conscious schlock masquerading as a thoughtful effort, The Quiet thinks it out-Heathers all the Mean Girls but really just ends up whimpering in the dark.
5728|0|Desperately trying to infuse new blood into the 1980s franchise, the fourth installment is a hodgepodge that fashions recycled ideas and characters; the rebllious girl is played Hilary Swank, who would go to Oscar glory.
76059|1|'80s comedy has some iffy stuff for PG; won't interest kids.
8292|1|Delicious three-course meal on the complications of romantic love.
65613|0|The dull and tedious splatter-fest See No Evil is, sadly, not even half as intriguing as its skuzzy pedigree.
67591|0|It's ironic that in 2003 we find Murphy playing a role that, for all intents and purposes, might have been done by Mantan Moreland 60 years ago -- only Mantan was funnier.
83372|0|It's occasionally cheesy, sometimes enjoyable, intermittently scary, and constantly spiked with celestial blatherskite.
1248|1|With Eastwood as Kincaid and Meryl Streep as Francesca, this carefully observant love story turns Waller's pop-lit passion into screen art.
53893|0|It's a strained romantic comedy that starts promisingly, takes a hard left turn and slowly falls apart.
92808|0|Call me rash, but I wager the worst flick of 2007 is Sarah Michelle Gellar's latest clunker, Happily N'ever After.
40048|0|Garbage. Worse than the first one.
95766|0|...Sydney White's astounding lack of positive attributes cements its place as an utterly worthless endeavor.
99206|0|All of the lead actors involved are far above the material. If they weren't involved it probably would have premiered on Cinemax at 3a.m.
93827|1|[There are] no weeping martyrs or brave romantic souls. It deals with real people, complete in their human complexity, their dumb choices, their damaging outbursts, their illogical desires, and their emotional honesty.
748|1|Chocked full of universal messages the director feels impelled to get across.
76673|1|What's good about the film is the sense of real evolution, of believable character change, instead of the Speedy Gonzalez transformations movie characters usually experience. What's also good is a realistic feel for the act of creation.
20061|0|A good chunk of The Exorcist III is taken up by a series of sit-down chats; close-ups of Scott's ugly mug are the only half-frightening thing on the screen.
8722|0|Whatever it is, I just don't see the pizzazz in Holly Golightly's life.
43591|1|Charlotte Rampling's performance, alone, is worth the price of admission...
101453|1|Like a lotus flower, Satyajit Ray's Jalsagbar (The Music Room) gently reveals its enigmatic central character
80859|0|The mildly enjoyable film tells of the bias in a rural farm community to newcomers from the city.
28681|0|It won't make anyone forget Miracle on 34th Street, but this is pleasant fare as far as holiday films go nowadays, which isn't very far.
13065|1|Fried Green Tomatoes is a case of a film acted with such skill and conviction that glaring problems of narrative, pace and structure seem like minor slips.
99405|0|Tragic tale of child abuse fails to make any sense of the crime.
31255|0|Five minutes into this formulaic flick, you'll think you collaborated on the screenplay.
76021|1|Three generations of Keatons are featured, from Joseph the elder to Buster's own son, while the period detail is at once comic and -- believe it -- totally accurate.
7906|1|Funny, vulgar Eddie Murphy--his best to date.
38031|0|The result sets itself adrift.
30388|1|Fitzcarraldo is a more objective record of a comparable fever dream, and as such is the preeminent testament of Herzog's labor as a filmmaker.
35656|0|The plot that Paddy Chayefsky has concocted to prove this point is so crazily preposterous that even in post-Watergate America -- where we know that bats can get loose in the corridors of power -- it is just impossible to accept.
29386|0|This bone-weary material would barely make for a passable episode of Diagnosis: Murder.
3717|0|Director John Carpenter is unable to generate anything resembling suspense or even basic narrative fluidity.
22625|1|John Cusack has unwittingly become Generation X's romantic screen icon.
55496|0|There's just enough to Stealing Harvard to prevent it from being the worst movie of the year. But the few things that this movie has going for it have nothing to do with Tom Green.
36408|1|Fun and funny.
89239|0|Larry's routine becomes considerably more embarrassing the longer it continues.
65517|0|The film never makes up its mind whether it wants to be an instant antique or a comment on one.
34011|1|he exciting thing about Deterrence is that *we* are the big scary bad guy who is acting irrationally - and yet the conclusion explains everything.
76458|1|A good, old-fashioned war movie, the kind of movie you watch with your dad on a Saturday afternoon.
42324|0|If people in the movies are going to live in dirty shacks without plumbing or senses of humor, they better do something compelling to hold my interest.

72118|1|It announces the arrival of Tina Fey into the ranks of smart screenwriters.
53465|1|The outstanding performances help smooth over the plot devices.
40192|1|Evocative of Tim Burton's work, the Scottish locations appear as a kind of ghoulish theme park full of ancient stately homes and mouldering, curse-ridden crypts.
11870|1|Nicholson explodes on the screen in a performance so flawless in timing and character perception that it should send half the stars in Hollywood back to acting school.
61751|0|This empty-headed comedy revels in its own admitted idiocy.
62800|1|The film's period decor, mood lighting and artful camerawork are beautiful, at times thrilling, to look at.
8587|0|very childish, and just a little trashy.
27755|0|The result doesn't begin to live up to such pomp; indeed, it is so deliberately paced and so strangely devoid of emotional stakes that maybe it proves that too much control isn't such a good thing.
90715|1|An enjoyably energetic genre romp.
71987|1|Docu is the best introduction to the Holocaust for tweens.
53251|1|Scorsese gives us a lot more than the Charles Foster Kane of the clouds. He keeps focus on Hughes, the dreamer, who continually reached out, grabbed the future and pulled it toward him.
100123|1|As a nature doc alone, Encounters at the End of the World would stand as one of the year's best. But it is the people who choose to live and work at the very ends of the Earth that are Herzog's real subject.
59307|1|A genuine charmer.
29003|1|An enjoyable roller-coaster ride that stops short of reaching its destination.
67047|1|Eventually turns into pathos-clogged sludge, but before that, features a string of shrewdly observed encounters.
58471|1|Cheesy, campy, corny, and violent. In other words, a rather fun little B-movie.
59014|0|Beautiful sets and costumes, cardboard characters.
11001|1|Mamet has a special gift for drawing portriats of lowlifers who are harsh but also funny, his salesmen are a far cry from Arthur Miller's Loman in Death of a Salesman.
98518|1|It's a wisp of a thing, but it's a lovely wisp.
72850|0|Martin's trademark wacky humor is fitfully in evidence, but seems much more repressed than usual in order to fit into the relatively realistic world of single working people.
75263|1|It's a stirring, emotional film about the unique hold memories have over people's lives and how experiences themselves are fleeting.
94859|0|Cashback aspires to be equal parts Volkswagen ad and Nicholson Baker's The Fermata, yet compares unfavorably to both.
78020|1|A hidden gem, worth hunting for...
7764|1|The film is about joy -- in conniving and surviving, in connecting with audiences, in its own fizzy, jizzy style. And that's why, compared with it, most other films look zombified.
50555|1|A post-Matrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon styled film, that is not a good film as much as it is an unusual one.
63915|1|Sellers is great. The movie is so-so
30775|0|While O'Donnell's anxious groom-to-be is likable enough, his lack of comic timing does little to improve Steve Cohen's unimaginative script.
40295|0|What could have been regarded as a good monster flick turned into a biblical and preachy flick.
97207|1|Om Shanti Om reaches exuberant musical highs that outshine the melodrama surrounding the set pieces.
102306|1|A Man Named Pearl not only makes you want to get out there and play Edward Scissorhands but can, at least for its 78 jazz-and-gospel infused minutes, help replenish one's faith in humanity.
89786|1|It's the director's willingness to toughen conventions through personal idiosyncrasies that sets the film apart.
82395|0|It's the perfect cinematic vehicle -- or at least it would have been, if Radford's adaptation weren't so unremittingly cloddish.
53495|1|Whenever the subtleties of political morality get a bit overbearing, there's a respite in the painterly streets of Paris, where, we are reminded, the past was another city, strange and resistant to present-day adornments.
44947|1|This might just be the perfect time to soak up some of its calm and natural beauty.
66488|1|Martin gives a multi-layered performance
92127|0|Yet another overwrought but uninspired fantasy in which all the wit is in the amusingly stylized sets and costumes rather than the script.
16326|0|Cry, cry, cry. Hug, hug, hug. Yadda, yadda, yadda.
15435|0|A movie of implacable unfunniness.
37570|0|Bad movie. Bad career move. Bad in all respects.
85001|0|Hollywood cranks out another prosaic teen-girl-romantic-comedy from its bottomless cultural vacuum in this Hilary Duff vehicle that no non-female person over the age of 12 should suffer through.
50815|1|That it's is so much of its moment doesn't mean that it's aged poorly... it's brash enough and inventive enough to still feel like a work of radicalism, more than 40 years on,
18746|1|A great family film, suitable for almost any age.
96988|1|It's not exactly It's A Wonderful Life, with Vaughn's trademark blokeishness starting to jar, Giamatti strangely miserable and the laughs generally thin on the ground.
82614|0|Two capable stars, Jack Nicholson and Ellen Barkin, lose their luster in this misfired comedy.
1704|0|Sadly, nothing following lives up to the prurient promise of this sequence, as the film becomes a monotonously talky, gloomy affair.
75729|0|"E-Mail This Article to a Friend KAENA: THE PROPHECY Words of wisdom: ""You don't need wings to be free! There's another world with a blue sun and so much sap you can swim in it!"" Maybe it sounds better in the French version."
80145|1|You can't help but like a film with as much verve, wit and (of course) gore as this one. A bloody good show.
90635|1|Just like 'Sack-a ja-we-a', let us guide you to a little treasure at the museum.
34445|1|The minute The Searchers begins, it's impossible to look away.
31977|1|A sobering overwrought drama based on Marsha Norman's Pulitzer Prize-winning play.
51142|0|It's a feature best viewed on mute. Or not at all.
93235|0|"Over twenty years after ""Hannibal the Cannibal"" made his film debut in Manhunter, the Dr. Lecter saga peters out with this misguided sequel."
95812|1|Writer-director Jeffrey Blitz brings wit and pathos to the story of a compulsive stutterer.
69422|0|"[I]t's hard to see any crying need to remake a film that was tacky the last time around, or to make this the black teen - excuse me, ""urban"" - film of the season."
32340|1|Unmissable.
48713|1|"Like Breillat's debut feature (""A Real Young Girl"") ""Fat Girl"" is a masterpiece awaiting inspection by audiences open to its meanings and insightful commentary."
80535|1|Often funny film boasts no less then 10 film directors on screen in small roles. Stick around for the Paul McCartney penned title song.
14545|1|Brave, yes, but undeniably excessive.
85946|1|Terrific casting can work wonders for a movie. If the stars are good enough, logic gaps as deep as the Marianas Trench disappear in the performers' glow.
30803|0|What begins promisingly soon deteriorates into a tepid mish-mash of implausibility.
14676|0|Ao que parece, projetos medíocres são tão difíceis de se matar quanto vampiros e lobisomens.
96835|0|Unfortunately for Martian Child this has more maple sap pouring out of it than a neglected Vermont tree looking for a good tapping.
15724|1|Hey, I actually really liked this picture.
32127|1|If you aren't sure you like jazz, see this movie just to be exposed to the Django sound! Your next trip might be to the record store.
664|1|It is is about as realistic as a Tom & Jerry cartoon, but then again, this is a Die Hard movie . . .
47500|1|Zucker instinctively knows how far to push the crude and uncouth, and when to retreat into the merely goofy.
34599|1|The uneven, insubstantial slapstick comedy is good for a few chuckles playing the white trash joke card.
44715|0|This sometimes-breezy romantic comedy tries hard to melt your heart with its snow-globe sweetness, but the strained quirkiness and not-quite-credible characters make the fluffy Snow more flaky than fun.
18262|1|[Broomfield] relishes portraying [Love] as a hypocrite, who stands up for free speech while attempting to manipulate and intimidate the media at the same time.
28648|1|a beautifully observed, wildly unpredictable period piece that's part bittersweet comedy, part adventure and altogether enchanting.
79696|1|Much beloved - and sadly overrated - by many science fiction fans. . .
47002|1|A very smart 'dumb' movie.
43650|1|What counts in Believer is not what happens but how. This is as good a how as any.
43538|1|The film's bloated ambition seems of a piece with its panting, happy-dog charm. [Blu-Ray]
31342|0|Probably too verbose to significantly influence the target audience.
77303|0|It lacks the wit and depth to make it anything more than a mediocre tale of Hollywood malcontents.
16825|1|Coppola has infused The Rainmaker with enough humor, character, honest emotion and storytelling style to make it one of the year's most entertaining movies.
19510|1|Shirley MacLaine and Debra Winger are fantastic as a mother and daughter who individually face life's challenges and end up stronger because of it.
48791|0|A mangy and ungainly movie, a cluttered and uncreepy assembly of stale clichés, telegraphed scares and low-rent effects.
11651|1|Like a light-hearted Brazil it conjures up imagery of such impact, and such resonant subject matter that it will (...) affect audiences for generations to come.
70460|1|simple paint-by-the numbers gay themed film that strikes directly at Mormon dogma, but it has a certain charm due mainly to Sandvoss' Herculean efforts
21022|0|Almost never takes thrilling flight.
33817|1|Shadows and lies are the stars of The Big Combo, a spellbinding black-and-white chiaroscuro with the segmented texture of a spider's web.
86559|1|What's great about all this isn't just the gloriously choreographed violence (among the best I've ever seen) but also Lee Byeong-heon's bravura and surprisingly profound performance
12472|1|Consistently riveting and intensely claustrophobic, the Oscar-nominated Das Boot is one of the most thrilling submarine pictures ever made in any language, and still is Wolfgang Petersen's best film by far.
45565|0|The twist ending isn't bad, but everything else is dreary and derivative.
61165|1|"""What a Girl Wants"" has the one thing ""The Princess Diaries"" desperately needed: hubba, hubba Colin Firth."
90159|1|Clever, liberatingly silly and sweet.
97875|0|A comedy wilderness.
97019|1|Yes, there is wonder here, and plenty of it.
75424|0|The recent assembly-line remaking of recognizable horror titles continues with The Hitcher, a dreary updating of the 1986 Rutger Hauer thriller.
30112|1|FRWL has character and dash, and even something of a conventional plot, all worth revisiting for this pin-sharp restoration.
80977|1|A glue-sniffer's reverie and an aestheticized episode of Beavis & Butthead, explicitly and bracingly set up as an act of cinematic vandalism
73174|0|The thrills don't mount as the film goes on. They don't even accumulate. Once they are experienced, they dissolve so thoroughly that by the end you're likely to feel as cheated as I did.
98461|1|Probably the best zombie movie since 1978's 'Dawn of the Dead.'
41916|0|Neither scary nor particularly funny.
54263|1|Actresses beware. Catherine Keener is quietly cornering the market on self-assured, sharp-tongued feminism.
94948|1|I commend Ash Brannon and Chris Buck's animated film, especially to those who have not yet reached the age of 10.
73373|1|This is a film that wants to ellicit not screams but shivers as it takes you on its journey into the heart of human darkness ...
21848|1|An entertaining burlesque of The Fugitive. Sit down (watch out for that whoopee cushion!) and enjoy the latest Hollywood sendup of films immemorial.
37247|1|Benji's lost in the wild! Get the kids!
50988|1|A subtly brilliant satire.
79650|1|Behold a Pale Horse may be flawed, but is well worth taking a look at.
9068|1|Joseph Mankiewicz was Hollywood's midcentury master of comic drama, and All About Eve, from 1950, was one of his signal achievements.
101058|0|A poorly staged, entirely laugh-free big screen exercise that, despite its name, is not really a genre spoof at all, but rather merely an excuse to (attempt to) poke fun at Hollywood movies from this calendar year.
75247|0|Even among dyed-in-the-wool fans of R&H, this one's largely remembered, if remembered at all, as a dud.
86140|1|It's also a generous performance, because Wood literally takes a backseat to Hutz's movie-stealing turn as the language-mangling Alex, whose English is 'not so premium'.
92508|1|"""More airport action than Die Hard 2."""
39610|0|Unless you want to see a former Superman playing a gay guy, The Broken Hearts Club has disappointingly little to offer.
69561|1|Theron makes Aileen realistically frightening and unreachable at times. Murder in her hands is certainly not cool.
79814|1|The absurdist fun resonates strongly in the memory.
15707|1|Hercules fires off mythology in-jokes and pop culture references at a speed that would dizzy the Animaniacs.
70615|1|Despite plenty of plot holes, cartoonish characterization and the general impression that no one involved is taking things too seriously, Hill manages to deliver a minor gem within the tense and claustrophobic confines of the slum walls.
2520|1|Sandler's best. Edgy, satirical, bizarre and surreal.
77999|0|Clancy's script is better than his direction, with several high points in both dialogue and scene construction. The material is darkly funny but not so dark as to be vicious.
75695|0|It's undoubtedly good-natured, old-fashioned family entertainment, but Two Brothers never quite manages to strike a successful balance between fantasy and reality.
8647|1|George Cukor gives it the royal treatment with a splendid supporting cast...
39778|1|Alarming, both for the way it allows its antihero to fully fall into madness and for the violence that this fall involves.
89429|0|The 4th pile of CRAP
34611|1|This isn't about one sock puppet's search to be all that he can be. It's about a community combining their talents to bring joy to the world.
18624|1|I think it works like a nasty little machine to keep us involved and disturbed; my attention never strayed, and one of the elements I liked was the way Paltrow's character isn't sentimentalized.
17319|0|Not as bad as everyone says, but still not worth seeing.
83415|1|Una película conmovedora, sugestiva y poética, donde gran parte de la convicción proviene de sus increíbles actores no profesionales.
31619|0|The Burton trademark special effects are typically fun, but the late release and lackluster performances make Sleepy Hollow feel exactly like its title: sleepy and hollow.
45585|1|An intelligent, tightly constructed film which manages to satirize both the military and the process of growing up.
38601|1|Love and Death is an almost total treat.
16574|1|...an essay about the human struggle toward meaning.
10791|1|Every once in a rare while a film comes along that works in all departments, with story, production and performance so well blended that the end effect is one of nearly complete satisfaction. Such is The Manchurian Candidate.
29021|0|A one-joke film in desperate denial and a terrible vehicle for Hoch.
84258|1|The movie oozes kitsch but is not without class.
22815|1|A well-oiled machine manufactured to tap our welled-up ducts.
94978|1|Surprisingly gentle in most of its humor and its gore quotient, making you wonder who exactly it was aimed at.
10130|1|A 1941 Disney animated feature about a harassed little elephant with big ears and his friendship with an imaginative mouse.
77909|1|I ♥ Huckabees might be too smart for its own good, but that also seems to be the point. Russell extols liberal activism while deflating its self-importance...
12379|1|Sergio Leone's cut is wonderful! Avoid the butchered theatrical version unleashed in the U.S.--I actually walked out on that indecipherable mess.
41282|1|Penn and Walken [are] at the top of their forms in roles that give them a lot to work with.
3282|0|Stone has guts, I'll grant him that; but he needn't have spilled so much of it in our laps.
2559|0|The entire film feels like the result of a market study.
27724|1|Don't go see The Blair Witch Project alone; it's too scary to sit through without company. Thrillingly, nauseatingly so.
8672|1|The first three-quarters might be at best B-tier Freed Unit filmmaking, but those last 18 minutes are as precious as anything produced by studio-era Hollywood.
35758|0|It's amazing what kind of cool stuff you can come up with if you first throw logic and physics out the window.
16594|1|A modern sci-fi classic comes home to high-def in a gorgeous new transfer.
90812|0|This thriller about books, belief and betrayal covers topical terrain -- JT LeRoy and James Frey, anyone? -- but itself proves unbelievable.
102197|1|This writer can't remember witnessing a harder-hitting kids' movie denouement than the one that closes this microcosm of middle-class German family life in WWII.
25034|0|You wouldn't expect high art from a title like this, but HOO BOY what a stinker. (OK, the puppet-work is pretty cool.)
99382|0|Not awful or offensive, but pretty weak broth nonetheless.
170|1|Sorkin starts his West Wing warm-up with a winning political rom-com.
21548|1|One of the most imaginative films I've ever seen, a fitting tribute to the brilliant career of the late master puppeteer, Jim Henson.
88923|1|"Fascinante enquanto observa o conflito entre o egoísmo da personagem de Bergman e a passividade dos habitantes de Stromboli (sempre submissos à Natureza), o filme se enfraquece em função da imposição ""espiritual"" de Rossellini."
37511|0|[Max's] his weapon is a souped-up auto, which sets up chase scenes that make The Dukes of Hazzard seem like a hayride -- a feat director George Miller engineered with a meager $1 million budget. Dramatically, however, the film is inconsistent.
25886|1|Classic Man versus Machine adventure is funny but violent.
52353|1|An extremely underrated Biblical epic.
53778|1|It's breezily entertaining and culturally specific without resorting to gross-out jokes or cruelty.
17228|1|I truly hope that Scream 2 proves to all of the doubters that horror movies are not all the same. They are not all equally bad, and by God, they are not all equally good. However, they don't get any better than Scream 2.
11309|1|Forget Titanic this is Cameron's best underwater flick
21366|0|The mundane plot of Snake Eyes is disguised with lots of camera razzle-dazzle.
95133|1|British director Michael Winterbottom's film is as close to naturalism as one can get.
70652|0|It really isn't easy to make a movie as mind-bendingly bad as Best Defense. It takes hard work, a very great deal of money and people so talented that it matters when they fail with such utter lack of distinction.
54262|1|This serio-comic family portrait about self-absorption, self-esteem and family dynamics is excellently acted but more blatantly offbeat than dramatic.
46153|1|Carpenter sweeps aside political preaching to allow the film to finish on a note of humour when the aliens are finally revealed for what they are.
77188|1|Reese's piece certainly looks good, it's just not terribly engaging.
26368|1|Besides the similarities in playing with time and structure, Nolan is already zeroed in on his favorite cinematic theme: obsession.
95066|1|This very inside but modestly amusing show-business satire doesn't seem too far-fetched or exaggerated.
43082|1|Não posso negar que Profissão de Risco é bem-sucedido: seu protagonista desperta simpatia. Isso é motivo de orgulho? Duvido muito.
37881|1|The movie that should've turned Treat Williams into a huge star. This is one of Sidney Lumet's finest hours.
58204|0|The notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy.
63931|0|Absolutely no saving graces here.
80744|1|A triumph of movie pop poetics.
101354|0|What we have is a comedy that's not that great, a romance that's not that convincing and a movie that's sadly not that special. Now that's how you lose friends and alienate people.
20954|1|Don't get caught somewhere in the middle, wandering around Neverland without a fairy guide.
66266|1|One wishes the only pairing of Clint and Burt were better, but City Heat is still fun.
28044|1|Truffaut's third film may not look the masterpiece it seemed 40-odd years ago, but it remains one of his most enjoyable movies.
27957|1|Arguably Stanley Kubrick's most perfectly conceived and executed film.
44344|0|Plays like a Hollywood version of The Real World, neatly edited and set in a striking but sterile home, but with few surprises.
39404|0|If the movies that make 'best lists' are filet mignon, the culinary comparison here probably is bait.
20078|1|Implausibility is a large part of the entertainment in this romp par excellence, with each overblown set piece becoming ever more ludicrous.
61332|0|[Director] Gray's straight-faced approach to his revenge fantasy is as unsettling as his material is absurd.
34795|1|Makes its point with sledgehammer-like strength.

10580|1|Thrilling third Indy actioner focuses on hunt for grail.
94305|1|At heart, it is a stoner comedy for college kids, but it strikes just the right balance between intelligence and infantilism to please almost any viewer who has ever enjoyed adolescence
61402|0|This meandering movie rises and falls depending on each individual storyline.
36301|1|This one has crossover hit written all over it.
15318|0|Dated and obvious.
71234|0|Esforça-se para parecer 'picante', mas não tem coragem sequer de exibir o corpo de sua protagonista.
86298|0|It's made with some style, but flags after the first rip-roaring action moments.
16298|1|Lively family comedy-drama, nicely served up
60547|1|Narrated by Julie Andrews with Marsden gleefully camping it up and Adams the personification of winning charm, only a Scrooge would deny the film possesses oodles of fun and wit. It's just not as enchanting as it deserves to be.
21626|1|While the script contains trite and unbelievable dialogue, the superbly convincing performances make up for these faults.
40736|1|Stone does populist anti-war with a passion.
66071|1|A finer political film you will not find. It should be declared a national treasure.
91010|1|... beneath the simple and straightforward facade lies a hidden depth that does not announce itself with dramatic intensity ...
19892|0|There are more than enough giant logic holes, stilted characters and idiotic developments to make sure that it is bad for reasons transcending its simple poorness as a sequel
32465|1|Nolte and Bridges are naturals together.
91134|0|Even though the plot forgoes the formulaic slam-dunk, hackneyed devices, low production values, and the stilted direction (by Preston A. Whitmore II) dribble the ball off the shoe and out of bounds.
72898|1|...shares the punk sensibilities of other films...which came out that year but also establishes themes and stylistic choices, many borrowed from the French New Wave, which would carry through Carax's own filmography.
78604|0|This oracular piece of hero-worship is perhaps the squarest film yet from this once-hip director.
12033|1|Deathless, and looking as good as new.
48921|1|The film belongs to Zahn, who turns his two-dimensional slacker character into a truly heartbreaking portrait of disillusion and guilt.
52547|1|A fine example of heartwarming real-life drama, with performances that ring true and some terrific moments that befit a classic American Dream story.
6600|0|It's a gnarled, brutal, highly manipulative film that, at its center, seems morally indefensible.
92857|0|The performances are good but the heavily cliched script ensures that there's very little of interest here, unless you're a massive stepping fan.
4440|0|As time-travel pictures go, this Jean-Claude Van Damme vehicle is a passable but disappointing excursion into well-traveled terrain.
48829|0|The qualities that have kept the Broadway Fiddler running these seven years are in scant supply onscreen.
102205|1|When the time comes for resolution, writer/ director Mark Herman suddenly delivers the unexpected; he does not sell out.
53016|0|Linklater fans, or pretentious types who want to appear avant-garde will suck up to this
31377|1|Director Alan Parker's story of a band of young Dubliners playing American '60s soul is fresh, well-executed and original.
80479|0|In the failure of Electric Dreams to blend and balance its ingredients properly, plot elements are lost (the brick), credibility is overtaxed (the lovelorn computer), and what remains is high tech without being high art.
68724|1|Even though the story almost makes no sense and the Oscar-winning editing has several illogical cuts, Bullitt is an exquisitely satisfying motion picture, particularly if there is still an adolescent boy lodged somewhere in your psyche.
100122|1|Seemingly off-hand, cumulatively imposing, utterly masterful.
16062|1|As it so often is, it's not silly or cute or whimsical. It is genuinely funny. And as such it leaves most of the other films of its formula behind.
15026|1|Depp's tight, guarded performance is almost painful to watch, and Newell seems to have reined in the flamboyant Pacino, whose portrait of the mobster as a grumpy old man may be his best work in years.
81265|0|Good idea unsuccessfully realised with Ed Burns doing his best.
78844|0|Lame-brain version of a classic UFO abduction.
102193|0|A film dealing with the Holocaust really should be a little less clumsily executed, manipulative and contrived than this.
82915|1|An accomplished confection, Witch is required Halloween viewing.
74491|1|Here's that rare movie that equals its source material.
9278|1|It's quite long, Hepburn sports one of her worst hairstyles, and Cooper and Hepburn's glaring age difference (28 years) is distracting, but this is a wonderful, charming romantic comedy nonetheless.
56730|1|Watching Tully reminded me of a time when calling a movie 'little' was a compliment, a way of saying a director had found ways to locate his movie in a world that seemed entirely real.

97819|1|...any misgivings get swept aside whenever the dancing starts, and fortunately, it doesn't stop for long.
101993|0|It's crushingly generic stuff - a combination of gross-out gags and clammy sentiment - but Seth Green's cameo as a sardonic Amish car mechanic has its moments.
90251|1|Interviews with metal practitioners such as Tony Iommi, Alice Cooper, Rob Zombie and Dee Snider, journalists and academic types paint a compelling portrait of a vibrant society of outsiders.
30636|1|Moore acquits himself in a larger than life adventure peppered with enjoyably rotten gags and lots of playful action.
49182|0|This film quickly sinks into a lame, ultra-predictable storyline that would never have made it past the made-for-cable-TV editorial commission.
93872|0|The film doesn't have any meaning. Not just because it's bad. Because at the very end, it's very obvious that there wasn't any point to anything.
88826|0|The potential it has to be an adult thriller is ruined because it's just more teen marketed crap.
69470|1|... the true star of this film is Eduardo Serra, who should have had the Oscar. Sweeping fantasy vistas are easy; creating a sensual feast through the camera's lens is hard.
24639|1|'80s classic is still fun for families with older tweens.

76743|0|A fairly lackluster reading of Greene's novel.
64411|1|Jake told us kids that what we always suspected was true: the summer of love was dead, long live the summer of the shark.
64125|1|A mismatch of flavours (Holmes, Wilder) the thought of which doesn't so much turn your stomach as lead to speculation, and the taste of which is soured only by a foreknowledge of missed opportunities.
29500|1|Worth watching.
84985|1|A blast of energy that reinvents the Dark Knight for a new generation of film-goers.
72058|0|Not quite as good as it should have been, despite spirited performances from Black and Stiller and Christopher Walken on top crazy bonkers mental form.
54193|0|A tedious, labored affair that's only not boring when it's laughably over the top.
7416|0|Nice performances by Connelly and Banderas can't make up for the rest of this snoozefest.
73412|1|Some Peckinpah devotees consider the film among his finest work, others regard it as, well, troubled. Fascinating, nonetheless.
72149|0|Most viewers will likely be checking their watches, probably wishing this Minute were gone in 60 seconds.
20251|1|Affectionate, innovative, and vaguely lunatic.
88972|1|The result is the hippest comedy of the year.
80646|1|"It all adds up to zany, wide-eyed, quintessential Waters havoc -- the ""kinder, gentler"" 1990s brand, perhaps. But the genuine article, nonetheless."
65956|1|More often than not you may find yourself unexpectedly smiling.
20575|0|Clumsy ol' Disney comedy.
81223|1|Summer Bishil turns in a gutsy, quietly riveting performance as Jasira.
27608|1|... like the work of a flamboyant art student who thinks that he can illustrate a profound love story by firing cannonballs of paint at a canvas.
13942|1|Star Trek finally gets imaginative, exciting and - dare I say it? - kinky.
63869|0|No.
46748|1|One of the most delightful surprises of 2001, and it has lost none of its charm or its surprising power in the intervening years.
45138|1|Beneath the stunningly lovely visuals -- all expressionist colours, reflections, and frames-within-frames, used to produce a precise symbolism -- lies a kernel of terrifying despair
19723|1|The Elm Street films have always been a cut above the competition, so to speak, with their playfully malevolent dream sequences and their mocking, ever-resourceful villain.
4808|0|The movie is like an advertisement for the 19 recently banned assault weapons.
75360|1|Powerful late-in-the-day gangster film.
63965|0|The storyline becomes too idiotic and lacking enough funny or relevant moments to fly as a cutting edge satire.
68858|1|The samba and bossa nova beats arent just score; they comprise the very environment of the film, as fundamental a force as the wind or the sun
56595|0|More often than not, the film lapses into basic thriller tricks.
51969|0|I sort of enjoyed it, but the movie plays amateurish and doesn't tell us anything new.
67010|1|It's another must-have for Disney fans.
51713|0|No one involved, save Dash, shows the slightest aptitude for acting, and the script, credited to director Abdul Malik Abbott and Ernest 'Tron' Anderson, seems entirely improvised.
46066|1|Satisfactory but forgettable manhunt thriller.
23562|0|God knows, it tries, but most of the jokes fall flat, and the movie never gets off the ground.
25300|0|It's audacious in its defiance of expectations, no doubt, but there's no pleasure in the unconventionality.
77486|0|Loud, messy, senseless, pointless, and cheesy.
88324|1|A truly remarkable phantasmagoria from Parodzhanov that unsurprisingly fell foul of the Soviet authorities, if only because of its abiding sense of Ukrainian nationalism.
52949|1|The leads acquit themselves fairly well, but the biggest winner is Selleck, whose low-key charm and gift for light comedy are put to good use here.
12320|1|Everything about this remarkable production is exhilaratingly unexpected.
75775|1|Vinton's own animated style is so subversive and gives the Christmas festivities a needed surrealism.
44229|1|It's a rather uncharacteristic role for Gregory Peck, in that there's not a trace of cuddliness or Atticus Finch-esque nobility to Frank Savage. He's a man with a job that needs to get done, and everything in his existence is subservient to that goal.
62059|0|Ghobadi has found a way to use the quest of one man to show all the problems in Kurdistan. It's interesting, occasionally funny and thought-provoking, but doesn't quite capture your heart.
9544|1|How sublime can movies get?

67509|1|Uno sabe que está ante un gran director cuando para conmovernos no hace falta más que un excelente grupo de actores, una cámara y una buena historia.
13241|1|So Chaplin may not have halted a war, but he still left us with more than just a funny movie.
60597|0|It's as if the blueprint for the basic outline never left the development table, resulting in a picture that's painted in wide swaths of soldier-boy posturing and pontificating.
92370|0|Clearly intended to be viewed through a haze of marijuana smoke, it'd be against the law for us to recommend this film.
81645|1|Fascinating story too complex for young viewers.
98658|1|Yes, this comedy about a sad-sack, has-been boxer is painfully predictable and manages to include every cliche of the genre, but executive producer and star Adam Carolla keeps it rolling along with his trademark, deadpan rants.

101965|0|The law of diminishing returns is in full effect here.
17661|0|Given its situational premise -- outer space goes underwater -- Sphere is filled with visual potential, yet Levinson can't tap it. He's just a whole lot more comfortable trying to tame the human software than the technical hardware.

19409|1|well-acted, well-written and brilliantly directed film that could be recommended even to those viewers with little interest in history of cinema
18143|1|Lacking the moral indignation and militant politics of Lee's former work, this vibrantly colorful father-son melodrama is soft at the center, but it's one of the most accessible films Lee has made and Denzel Washington is terrific.
23636|0|Adequate in every way and oddly subversive in spots, but that's about it.
70374|1|This film alone serves as ample explanation for why Clara Bow will forever remain a Hollywood legend.
33277|0|Should've left the first one alone
11987|1|It's much funnier, and sadder, watched stone-cold sober.
25381|0|It's the laziness of the project that's finally most galling.
19105|1|The film is destined to box office approval of the most substantial character. It is finely made and merits high rating as cinema art and significant recognition as major showmanship.
44127|1|The substance of La Notte is owed entirely to Antonioni's intoxicating ambiance, and his stars' ability to speak in looks and gestures more than words.
15532|1|This twisted romance possesses the soul and edgy atmosphere of an independent film but not quite the conviction.
15627|1|Resolutely not boring.

44540|0|Its clumsiness turns it, against its best intentions, into half-baked operatic kitsch.
76630|1|The highlight are two long takes in which Magnani walks the nighttime streets of Rome, exhilarating, free-wheeling cinematic moments without close parallels anywhere.
79382|1|It's a brilliantly accomplished work offering a mixture of bitter comedy and outright despair.
12215|1|A masterful, beautiful and deeply-felt action movie that reinvents the genre.

72094|0|The two lead players ... seem the least likely of anyone in the film to fight for themselves, unless you give them very large cocktails.
64777|0|It looked good when I was 12. Now it totally bores.
1298|1|A masterpiece, perhaps the masterpiece, of American loner-ness, a portrait of a psycho as a young man. Scorsese's interest in raging bulls and New York City wolves would return, but his fifth fiction-feature remains his magnum opus.
54528|0|Long and boring musical about the American Revolution.
59933|0|Smug, silly, and forgettable, this vanity project wants to be the next cult hit but really is just another vehicle for Bruce Campbell...

100445|1|Describing what Steal a Pencil for Me is about might actually do a disservice to this affectionately observed documentary.
11585|1|Bob Roberts is not merely a satirical fictional biopic, but a wry exploration of the relationship between political reality and manufactured image.
1064|1|Enjoyable, frequently hilarious horror comedy, although it's stronger on laughs and gloopy gore effects than it is on actual scares.
31760|1|Star-producer Warren Beatty takes a stereotypically gay character, a glamorous hairdresser, and turns it into a womanizer in Beverly Hills, which is sort of Our Town, suburbia as small-town America, only four decades later.
36576|0|Not too much finesse distinguishes the script, which carries neither warmth nor particular interest for the various characters.
368|0|It would be hard to expect any surprises from a film called Ninja Assassin, but on the other hand, it would be hard to be disappointed by it either. It does exactly what it says on the tin.
67252|1|In the end, the girls' stories are inspiring and heartbreaking, making this sensitively directed film one of the most rewarding of the year.
34544|1|The film's true power lies in its ability to entertain, fascinate, teach and absorb all in one sitting.
38765|1|It definitively skewers the false innocence of American pop culture on the eve of the countercultural deluge.
93126|1|The multiple story threads make it a little unfocused from a thematic standpoint, but it's a generally well-executed lark, neither too serious nor too silly for its subject matter.
70675|1|For every joke that misfires, there's either a decent joke or a genuinely romantic or heartwarming moment.
54572|1|The most wondrous love story in years, it is a great film.
19255|0|Sominex is cheaper and probably safer.

97410|1|Langella's nuanced performance saves the film; the actor has an understated but powerful role, and he takes full advantage.
80047|1|View this film about Billie Holiday as a completely fictional story, and you'll enjoy it far more than you would otherwise.
93344|1|Splendid.
50860|1|Messy but eerie.
75383|1|Among a cast loaded with talent, McQueen and Robinson are excellent
101446|1|It's a full-on Shakespearean tragedy that manages to be both critical of and sympathetic to its main character.
49087|1|A decidedly weird time-travel drama that puzzled viewers so much that many went back to see it again and again... Unfortunately, Kelly's extended version diminishes the film's impact.
77725|1|An intriguing and underrated film with a great deal to say.
35137|0|It hardly delivers on the promise of giving us the pure, undiluted Williams -- Williams at his best. What's more, it's not even close to being his best movie. It's not even close to being good.

28669|1|Good, albeit overlong Grisham thriller
71934|1|It's not that they don't make comedies like After Hours anymore. The fact is there's never been a comedy quite like this one.
45911|0|The animation is fine. But the Stu Krieger screenplay contains violence that might be hard on the younger ones, preachiness that's hell on adults and a never-let-up cuteness that can turn minds of all ages to mush.
49859|1|A mix of gritty realism, crisp storytelling and radiant compassion that effortlessly draws you in.
77074|0|A botch job of mistimed scare scenes, bland characters and computer-generated hyenas.
85617|1|The movie is a sci-fi buccaneer swashbuckler; Whedon hits all the obligatory space-opera notes, and he does it with a degree of verbal wit and agile pacing that could teach George Lucas a thing or two.
50365|1|If this is melodrama, it's melodrama of a superior rank, and I salute it.
50357|0|Trivializes World War II's darker moments in service to its cheesy romantic triangle.

26722|1|A thought-provoking and ethically charged tour de force based on Terence Rattigan's 1946 play.
87278|0|"Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson is utterly lacking in charisma ... His complete lack of presence is deadening to the film because he's in almost every scene."
880|0|The movie is fast, slick and dumb as a post.
13350|1|The kind of sweeping pseudo-biblical epic that Hollywood was famous for. If not for Heston's weak performance and Boyd's ludicrous one, the film might have been better.
58775|1|Short on plausibility but preserving the psycho-sexual ambiguities throughout, Bigelow's seductively stylish, wildy fetishistic thriller is proof that a woman can enter a traditionally male world and, like Megan, beat men at their own game.
85952|1|Strictly B-grade fare, but it has a playful wit and enough genuine tension to make it worth your time and money.
71937|1|This is one of Scorsese's best, and one of my favorites of his.
23204|0|While Murphy probably has what it takes to make the comedian-to-serious actor transition, he needs to do what Martin, Williams, and Carrey did: hold out for a good script.

82837|0|Hokey but lavishly filmed submarine spy drama.
20555|0|Bland and bizarre attempt at Disneyfied super-heroics.

39562|1|This fringe milieu is inhabited with all sorts of eccentric characters to wring laughs from.
73247|0|As a comedy it can never sustain itself, and while there are moments to enjoy, it is all pretty forgettable, which is a shame because the concept remains an amusing one.
100613|1|A period romance, charged with provocative undercurrents about art, war and the eternal battle of the sexes.
4022|1|An overlooked gem
66579|0|Mobsters is a bloody little fairy tale that makes good guys out of Lucky Luciano, Frank Costello, Bugsy Siegel and Meyer Lansky. According to the film, a largely plodding affair, they were just four kids who liked to kill people once in a while.
18701|1|Thoughtful, personal examination of the dichotomy of North Carolina as a bizarre mix of the tolerant and the intolerant, the progressive and the reactionary.
67992|0|Scratch away the steamy, evocative surface, remove Jeanne Moreau's veteran-voiced narration, and you have only art-film banalities.
101911|1|Mechri allows the verbally challenged action star dignity and, with this, the film works. Maybe next time he could bring Jean-Claude and Mickey Rourke together. Now that would be a movie.
12333|1|A grand movie entertainment.

67350|0|I'm not sure if the film is brutally honest or exploiting a tragic disorder. I felt drained when I left the theatre; the more I thought about it, the less satisfied I was.
66039|1|Donen's manipulation of spinning torsos and piston-pumping knees across Cinemascope sprawls is inventive everywhere
74255|1|You may come out rebuking yourself for your laziness or your choices or your fatalism or your fears, but you will come out glad you saw this movie.
97826|0|While still not a grand work of art, Meet the Spartans improves upon the formula established in the earlier parodies of Friedberg and Seltzer.
95112|1|While much of Sicko is certainly propaganda, that should not deter anyone from seeing it or giving some credence to what Moore is saying, because what he is talking about is very real and very important.
10065|1|[After the] headlong launch into that abstract fantasia of color and sound, it's difficult to deny the sexual nature of its characters' pelvic thrusts and rampant phallic imagery. Clearly, this is Disney's horniest animated feature.

52968|0|When it became obvious that the film's mix of cutesy sentiment and vague scariness wasn't working, the company ordered whole sequences to be rewritten, re-shot or re-edited, then imposed a stupid ending that explains precisely nothing.

12710|1|The role of Keating is a plum assignment for the talented Williams, who largely steers clear of schtick under Peter Weir's direction. Nicely shot with a good youthful cast.
72104|0|Director Peter Howitt shows a facility for reducing an intriguing premise to lowest-common-denominator fodder for network TV.
64985|1|Incident at Oglala is an even-handed cry of outrage, a coolly passionate documentary that focuses a piercing ray of light on an American scandal.
25018|0|No one in the right mind would call this a good film, or even a decent one, but thankfully, rookie feature director John Bruno's romp is not a complete waste of celluloid.
69362|0|The real point of the film seems to be the poster image of a battle-ready Tom Cruise waving a sword and all decked out in gleaming red-and-black samurai armor.

22706|1|As teen comedies go, it's not awful
34667|0|Mercifully, this feature is only about 80 minutes long. It probably won't frighten kids, but it might bore them instead.

3138|1|Another undisputed classic from the mind of James Whale.
101615|1|Uma mistura de documentário e esquete do Saturday Night Live.
52846|1|[Kaufman and Gondry] dive right into the subject [of sex] to lay bare the pain of it, and to have us laugh at it.
11264|1|Wonderful to get one last sweet visit with Mr. Fonda and Ms. Hepburn.
6091|1|The movie's dark themes, unhurried pace and talkiness make it something of a gamble for many children. But older children -- especially those who have been asking specific questions about death -- may find some nourishment in this garden.
88851|1|There is no downtime in the production. You'll spend every moment oohing and aahing at the delicate balance of nature in the gently swaying deep sea.
32787|1|Sentimental but not overly smaltzy
30058|1|Aldrich has here set a precedent -- an anti-war film within the studio system. And it remains highly entertaining.
94201|1|Earnest but lackluster period biopic on the final days of the mentally tortured deaf composer Ludwig von Beethoven.
98590|1|It's a hard movie to sit through at times, but if you're a fan of the actors, especially Rockwell, I believe you will find it a rewarding experience.
72809|1|Seldom has a sequel so completely transcended its predecessor.
64922|1|A touching love story without a cynical bone in its body.
16411|1|Intelligent and gripping.

48508|0|Bland, occasionally funny Disney comedy about a wayward seventh-grader.
12053|0|To Kill a Mockingbird is a time capsule, preserving hopes and sentiments from a kinder, gentler, more naive America.
38186|1|Great fun for an undemanding night out.
80616|0|Chiodo takes an alien invasion plot familiar from the 50s, and makes it all his own by rigorously and liberally painting it with every clown reference imaginable.
2057|1|The kind of film that defines guilty pleasure. Stallone and Schneider are miscast, but the mindless sci-fi action is fun.
81286|1|... subtly sexual and erotic, despite the fact that every scene takes place in the office and there is not a single overt sexual act or word or gesture or reference.
77144|0|Call it, Payoff Zero!
29947|1|As usual with Sturges, you wonder how he was able to get away with so much innuendo during Hollywood's Hayes Code period.
102419|1|Manipulative and flawed, but interesting and occasionally moving.
81551|0|A film of pat psychology
40285|1|It holds few surprises, but it's just the ticket if you're in the mood for two hours of proudly traditional entertainment.
84949|1|A killer soundtrack and a performance all of volatile physicality by Kaye.
99636|0|Bell makes some good points about the dark side of the American dream, but much of his argument about steroids is muddled.
58584|0|Mostly, the satire here amounts to nudging us into feeling superior to other people's lives.
17216|1|Slightly milder sequel to the post-modern slasher.

32038|1|Tumbleweeds is a slender novella of a film, but it's closely observed and honestly presented.
60702|1|well-made, but almost relentlessly downbeat portrait of self-destruction -- it makes Winona Ryder's similar 'Girl, Interrupted' look like 'Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm'
97443|1|An endearing film that will bring you to tears and have you cherishing every relationship and day you have.
16137|1|An adrenaline-pumping political thriller.
82360|0|Even with three top-flight actors, The Assassination of Richard Nixon never becomes much more than a character study of a footnote in American history.
44646|1|The characters are so full-bodied and the feelings so raw and complex that I'd call this the best thing John Singleton has done to date
35038|1|One finds in them the same unabashed enjoyment of color and movement, of spectacular athletics and outrageous stunts, that animates the Hong Kong action cinema as a whole and makes it so superbly entertaining.
2839|1|The result not only follows the lives of the boys as they mature into men, suffering success and disaster along the way, but also provides a picture of tough inner-city life shorn of glamour or unnecessary melodrama.
37639|1|Check your brain at the door, enjoy with popcorn.
57007|1|In the end, the film is not about an attraction between two people, but about the love of the spectator for the image -- the perverse transactions between the audience and the screen.
38819|1|The bastard father of Three Kings
20029|0|At its worst, well, it's just another soulless, hacky-tacky horror sequel.

16421|1|Drug use and sexual content in Ang Lee masterpiece.

62698|1|Overrated, but with enough great moments to be a must-see
93460|1|Embora nada original, o roteiro é suficientemente divertido e explora muito bem as mais do que estabelecidas personas da dupla principal: o jeitão desajeitado e auto-crítico de Grant e a insegurança engraçadinha de Barrymore.
63867|1|Becker is handy with a camera and totally knows where the film's bread is buttered, focusing all his energy and attention on his four stars.
24213|1|A well-realized drama about a closed-off young woman who learns to get in touch with her inner voice.
85861|0|No amount of fidgety editing and anxious soundtrack atonality can distract from the creakingly implausible scenario.
31965|1|Much is unemphatic, but all of it carries the moving weight of conviction. And it ends on a healing grace-note which passeth all understanding.
69955|0|...palpably overlong...
69403|0|Unfortunately, up until the end, the tall tales are far more interesting than reality.
34645|1|Not as good as the original Muppet Movie, but close.
14124|1|Leonard Nimoy has rarely been so moving.
93698|1|An all-star cast delivers in David Fincher's look into the investigation around one of history's great unsolved serial killer cases.
92102|1|A convoluted and often ridiculous, if also enjoyable, thriller.
95281|0|Barely worth the trip.
85553|1|The script crackles with funny, quotable dialogue and the plot has a lot of fun with the usual teen movie staples.
98443|0|The whole vaguely pitiable enterprise has tiny flickers of brilliance which can't be denied, but almost can't be detected, either.
29112|1|A tightly coiled rage seethes beneath the pretty surface of American Beauty, a wickedly funny black comedy directed by newcomer Sam Mendes.

85352|0|After the recent crop of enjoyable superhero movies, this is just an embarassment.
8202|1|About four female friends who take delight in exploring their capacity for anarchy.
87245|1|Unfolding slowly, then building in momentum like the hymns themselves, this entire sequence is tremendously affecting.
85956|1|The problem is that this film has nothing particularly new and original to make it stand out from the thrillers like, for example, Larry Cohen writes.
21938|1|This is the kind of thriller Hitchcock was making in the 1940s, filled with macabre details, incongruous humor, and the desperation of a man convicted of a crime he didn't commit.
25441|1|Contains just enough of a message about self-worth and honesty to lend some moral nutrition to the entertainment calories it provides so capably.
44944|1|a gorgeous dream half-remembered.
91513|1|Damn if the movie, through Mel's sheer determination, doesn't almost turn from a fight-n-flight gore fest into a moving meditation on a civilisation in the throes of decline. Almost.
68575|1|Potheads who watch this will probably check their stash the next morning to see if any of it's gone.
69714|1|Secret Things is definitely erotic and will appeal to prurient interests with its soft core pornography. But there is also the tale of ambition...
42467|1|"Pop and Rock stars will come and go, but there is only one Elvis, and the concert film ""That's the Way It Is"" proves that, once and for all..."
30001|1|No wonder we all feel nostalgic for the past.
28792|1|The movie is no timeless classic, but it's definitely a unique one-off.
98679|0|"While both [this movie and ""Karate Kid""] are unintentionally hilarious, the difference is no one will remember ""Never Back Down"" in two weeks, let alone 20 years."
12861|1|Comic anarchy at its very best. This one just keeps getting better.
14959|1|The ending of the film is rather abrupt, but most of the time this film runs as slick as oil, thanks to impeccable production standards, a solid script and good performances...
84619|0|...an obnoxious romantic comedy that takes every stereotype about pushy in-laws and morphs them into a practically unbearable mix of broad slapstick and shrill bickering.
18913|0|...Adequately simple for children, though perhaps a bit pedestrian for adults.
12745|1|From sky to ground in two shots, and it already feels like we've traversed a great distance, with two and a half hours of skillful, suspenseful WWII adventure to go.
73407|1|...it could've %u2014 should've %u2014 been [Peckinpah's] third or fourth masterpiece (that depends on who's doing the counting), and the movie he'd been building towards his entire career.
46156|1|An erratically amusing throwback to the science-fiction paranoia films of the 1950s.
78338|1|... we'll save the arguments about the patronizing nature of blues fetishism for another time. If you wish you were there, you'll want to see this film.

32231|0|Loses steam in the end.
25979|1|Surprisingly entertaining.
56332|1|The kind of sweet-and-sour insider movie that film buffs will eat up like so much gelati.
63529|1|Fun, if standard, animated adventure with battles, innuendo.
10917|1|Platoon is different. It matters.
43032|1|If you think the spy-thriller genre has been streamlined and spoofed and subverted until nothing new can be done to it, think again.
94333|1|Puccini for Beginners doesn't quite make it as romantic comedy. Most of the elements are in place, but the characters seem too narcissistic to fall in love and too broad-brush to be authentic.
99802|0|Reynolds and Mortimer won't be fazed by this misfire but Chaos Theory certainly lives up to its title. It's a mess.
72583|1|Efficient but not exciting.
56884|1|In the amazingly hyperbolic finale, DePalma conflates patriotism, dirty tricks, violence against women, and slasher movies into a single sick joke.
89087|1|While still criticized for its creative distortions, Flaherty's groundbreaking documentary of Eskimo life is among the most important films of the silent era.
75479|1|It sounds nuts, but one of the best movies in town is about the relationship of a man with his eel.
77127|0|In the funny outtakes, you can watch how the snakes band together to vote the stupid humans off the island.
100934|0|Not maudlin enough to make it memorable
41912|1|stinks
9277|0|An over-long and only spasmodically amusing romantic comedy...
2851|1|One of the most widely discussed and well-received documentaries of the decade.
57478|1|Over-rated but still holds up as a moderately amusing sit-com lightweight parody of the cold-war and small-town America.
4657|1|There are lots of admirable things about Federal Hill, starting with Richard Crudo's sparkling black-and-white cinematography
75053|1|If you have an indie film sense of humor -- and those of you who have it know what I mean -- you'll probably enjoy this flick.
39970|1|The sets, the cars, the costumes, everything about the production is authentically nostalgic.
2613|0|This is one of those big, sleek soulless movies that hums along, impressed with itself and the Big Issue it allegedly tackles... [but] what Disclosure really does best is appeal to your most prurient instincts.
60391|0|The film strives to be poetic, but it exposes nothing especially moving or relevant. Rather, the engaging leads wander around like actors lost in an ill-fated exercise in subtext.
72237|1|The movie has a tactile reality. You can almost smell it.
80116|1|As a picture of blue-collar America the film is credible and compassionate.
40446|1|Thin on investigative reporting, but thick with emotion.
91889|1|The movie features a wide array of interview subjects - but, thankfully, the most passionate voice is Lennon's.
89285|1|Even if you've never given a second thought to who bestows ratings on movies or how those ranks are given, Kirby Dick's enlightening documentary will catch you up in its infectious spin of curiosity.
20037|1|Sans the suspense of the first two movies, but still a worthy addition the ghoul series
6796|1|Exhibits many of the genre's common weaknesses, but the fine acting of Edward Norton, Laura Linney and Richard Gere enables us to forgive them.
42088|0|Signs and Wonders fails because Mr. Nossiter doesn't bother to define the women as characters; he seems as deluded as Alec.
32803|1|A bleak, black comedy in which the laughter can die in the throat.
67434|0|Content to be a kind of Valentine to the slain rapper -- so reliant on recycled MTV footage that it feels more like a Behind the Music special than a feature film.
34574|1|Misses the savage satire of Fay Weldon's novel.
95756|1|Excellent performances by everyone involved help you overlook the incongruity of French-speaking actors in traditional English settings.
18432|0|Disaster movies are trim and exciting or they're nothing, and Deep Impact isn't trim or exciting.
82226|1|This sleeper may very well be the best B-film ever made.
84727|0|My impression remained this time around of an unfinished screenplay in which too many intervals of small talk masqueraded as the forerunners of emotional events that never materialized.
46133|1|Unquestionably it's a feat of imagination and technique, but an hour of it is more than enough.
2665|1|Definitely worth watching, but goes a little OTT.
63380|1|Stewart is touching as a man who feels completely powerless to provide for his wife or to improve his standing.
96653|1|Average romantic drama that stays watchable thanks to its excellent cast, though it's neither as emotionally engaging nor as clever as it thinks it is.
36834|1|This is vintage Allen, his powers intact after a string of increasingly cranky, creaky films in the last few years.
6898|0|If it makes at least one person search out and discover the original version, then it's all worth it.
73699|0|Alternately fascinating and boring.
61766|0|Wildcats is about how spunky Hawn is and how cute it's supposed to be that this little woman can make all those great big football players do what she says.
36064|0|The film misfires because of its weak script, lack of punch to its comedy, and the plot was too incredible to believe or become absorbed in.
15054|0|Here is your post-holiday depression pill: Children of Men. Not to relieve depression. To cause it.
77521|1|The remake is so faithful to the first film that some of the snap and crackle disappears if you know the plot. It's like watching The Sixth Sense for a second time.
65234|0|Feels cramped and constrained at just about every level.
69226|1|... all the classic hallmarks of the Marx Brothers - Groucho's one-liners, musical numbers, rapid fire word play and Margaret Dumont - are present in the film
53906|1|A sleek espionage thriller that reduces the world to the size of a postage stamp. Matt Damon is terrific.
50655|0|"For one of the acts in Neil Simon's stale anthology, Maggie Smith won a Supporting Oscar for playing a hard-drinking actress who complains to her bisexual husband (Michael Caine) that ""Acting doesn't win Oscars. What I need is a dying father."""

18072|0|These Robinsons should have gone into therapy, not space.
59505|0|Gets more convoluted and thus less involving as it goes along.
93992|1|The film is novelistic in its nuance, in the patience of its storytelling and in the complexity of its mostly unhappy characters.
10072|1|It feels older than contemporary Disney work due to flat, creaky animation. The story still has resonance for kids, though.
92812|0|"...there's certainly no denying the effectiveness of one unintentionally hilarious moment in which Biel's spurned boyfriend exclaims, ""I guess it only takes one hand to push people away!"""
43599|1|The film at least manages to make some sense of an extraordinary moment in history, as Rome expanded from republic to empire.
18968|1|It all ends with famous psychic Criswell asking the audience, 'Can you prove it didn't happen? God help us in the future'. Prophetic.
14217|1|Can you resist a movie with a Jon Bon Jovi theme song? You can? But this was before he turned into a total wuss!
86107|1|A spirited diversion that showcases the talents of Witherspoon and Ruffalo, who should team up again soon.
41475|0|It's mostly dreary, plodding stuff that works as psychology 101.
65564|0|Unmotivated story riddled with confusion and disarray. Production staff does the job with little imagination.
35682|1|Kevin Costner displays some charisma, for once, in a twisty, stylish espionage thriller.
38506|0|Suffice it to say, the Pokemon films are only for hard-core followers -- and immensely patient and understanding parents.
38508|0|Scary Movie is a better family film.
92855|0|The dynamic dance sequences have all the right moves, but there's precious little to hold the attention once the music stops.
23719|1|A gruellingly tough watch.
47804|0|A horror movie without horror, a spook pic without spookiness and a metaphysical drama without the slightest spiritual tug.
81616|0|Chances are that those who haven't bolted for the door after the first 15 minutes will love it; others could be driven to drink.
37883|1|An astonishing in-depth portrait of the interlocking worlds of police and hoodlum results, with no punches pulled and no easy solutions.
49650|0|This is, quite simply, horror porn, with barely any connective tissue linking each set piece.
24546|0|This is the first picture in the series that feels inert.
71744|0|A pretentious bore.
75841|1|Mental illness never looked so seductive or bit with such a ferocious over-bite as from Gene Tierney's demented character.
72826|1|Hepburn and Tracy at their romantic-antagonistic best!
101761|0|Pride and Glory doesn't add anything to the generic crooked-cop procedural that we haven't seen with more verve in better movies.
100752|0|It's a film that probably will please its targeted viewer more than it did me.
49152|1|It's a pitiless film, uncompromising in what it shows us.
100319|1|A fascinating exploration of female friendship, love, manipulation, betrayal and healing.
67625|1|"A depressing confirmation of everything those of us who don't object to the description ""unelected"" have suspected all along: George W. Bush is an incurious, uncharismatic, overgrown frat boy with a mean streak a mile wide."
95875|0|A plodding and highly questionable history lesson.
68498|1|A stunning starring vehicle for Cagney that shaped his career. Dated and a bit slow, but Cagney magnetism shines through even then.
32505|1|A rather superficial and limited probe of American male sexual hypocrisies.
12729|1|The remarkably true ring of Webb's dialogue is preserved and augmented, the visual potential lifted to next power in absurdity.
63082|0|The easiest way to write a review of Dumb and Dumberer might be to say that it lives up to its title.
41467|0|It's one big cliché of sentimental drivel.
52450|1|Oh, you could analyze and debate and dissect the individual vignettes to smithereens, which is what makes it literary, I 'spect. But that would be too much like homework.
47439|1|A stunning and stylish update of The Reckless Moment (1949), the sophomore effort from Siegel and McGehee is a taut psychological drama that lingers long after its credits roll.

97833|0|...couldn't get a laugh from a hyena.
69535|0|Turning into a twisted pretzel, House of Sand and Fog becomes a melodrama straining to make its point.
42537|0|The original Alfie was as much overrated as the remake is underrated. Split the difference.
92241|1|Not every story comes together into a satisfying climax, and it feels like some time has been wasted with some people that could have been better spent with others.
75644|0|Mortimer, McElhone, and Butler each bring sensitivity and likability to their roles, but they've an uphill battle personifying characters who are, respectively, a clairvoyant, a fantasist, and a fantasy.
21349|1|There are a few nice moments when Barrymore's acting talent shines through, and the same can be said for Huston and Scott. But as a romantic comedy, this film is only slightly above average.
75126|1|With Fool for Love, he has succeeded on two levels that seem opposed to each other. He has made a melodrama, almost a soap opera, in which the characters achieve a kind of nobility.
81203|0|A long slog through the slough of despond.
15452|0|I had the disquieting sensation not of seeing two funny men but of watching two comedians from a distant age go through the motions of what they, all evidence to the contrary, still believe to be funny.

57107|1|In Albert Brooks' second comedy, which is both funny and irritating (some of it by design), he plays a nuerotic film editor who's unable to sustain a normal relationship
93861|1|Highly theatrical and dripping with gothic atmosphere, it's hardly realistic and the love story never convinces, but it is mesmerizing...
68757|0|This 1933 film is the best known of the Warner Brothers Depression-era musicals, though it doesn't compare in dash and extravagance to later entries in the cycle.
65453|0|Has moments of style and audacity, but the script is a shameless muddle and the shifts in tone -- from gooey romance to hard-driving, hyper-pop action -- give the impression that the movie was directed by six or seven people in alternating shift.
45965|0|If Redford had left out a few of the waffling, undecided characters and drawn his dramatic lines more strongly, the film might have been a lot more powerful.
84240|0|Such a low-key drama that I'm not sure anything happens in it at all.
53201|1|Com boas atuações de Kilmer e D'Onofrio, o filme tem um roteiro razoável, mas sem foco. Salva-se graças ao interessante personagem principal.

101755|0|The Spanish film worked better than John Erick Dowdle's remake, which is, if possible, even more chaotically filmed to the point that you often haven't got the slightest idea what's happening -- you just know that it's nasty.
765|1|...it's ultimately difficult not to be drawn into the soap opera-ish exploits of the central characters.
15456|0|In this movie and many like it, the only elements that count are impact, impact, impact and impact. The fifth element is gibberish.

79273|1|This is the master of subversion's most subversive work.
1887|1|Documentary about a controversial underground comics artist who talks freely about his strangeness.
2487|1|What it loses in novelty and subtlety it makes up for in its earnest depiction of love and individual human decency in the face of societal cruelty.
44050|1|Fisher's intelligence and humour turn what might have been movie brat indulgence into something much sharper and involving.

13465|1|Se a primeira metade impressiona pelo virtuosismo técnico, a segunda fascina pela coragem em observar sem sensacionalismo a magnífica força de vontade de um sobrevivente, beneficiando-se ainda da maravilhosa performance semi-auto-biográfica de Ngor.
72892|0|One of the most despised motion pictures, not just among Steven Seagal's works, but also in entire movie history.
91927|1|Odd, but brilliantly so. It's a small film that feels big, a period drama that looks modern, defying comparison to anything but Nolan himself.
32178|1|More a curio than anything else.
2002|1|The story is negligible, but it offers the same order of fun as a good rock video: the marriage of images and music.

35302|1|One of Ritt's best films.
22004|1|Devoid of any Hitchcockian touches, the movie disappoints only in that it could have been made by any filmmaker experimenting in the faux-documentary style during this period (Jules Dassin comes to mind) -- otherwise, it's gripping material.
60609|0|McElhone and Bale are more overt, acting mostly with rigid faces, tousled hair and at least 64 shiny, well-displayed teeth.

47948|1|This is an inherently moving story, and director Mark Jonathan Harris has the wisdom to trust that.
57382|1|"[A]s in soap opera, drama is synonymous with the torments of love. Hayek is a brave, tireless performer, ... but given the script she can only play Kahlo the ""beguiling personality"" she liked to think of herself as ... rather than Kahlo the artist."

87988|0|There's no edge in Ledger's performance, only a lot of cutesy moments.
98847|1|What this film delivers is a close-up of the band doing something they clearly love.
92187|1|More of a TV documentary than a movie, but there's enough good stuff here to keep you from cussing.
101541|0|A shaky platform of sense but the visual genius is so great, the film must be seen.
88518|1|You won't be scared one bit, but that's not exactly the point here. The murder is the only message.
101562|0|It's a cruel, mean-spirited kind of humour that highlights the lack of anything resembling real wit in the screenplay.
41862|0|One of the worst movies ever made.
54187|1|Child performances are allways a deal breaker, but Noyce coaxes great range and rage from his child stars. As they trek across the vast land, the camera never gets in the way of focussing its energies on the protagnonists.
100972|1|A film with an urgent message that uses the medium to its advantage.
17709|0|Ferrara is so obsessed with giving King of New York an artsy, edgy, improvisational feel that he doesn't seem to realize what he has here is really just another angry gangster picture.
22444|0|The Lodger is a spooky story ruined by lumpen dialogue, cloddish performances and a director and writer (David Ondaatje) oblivious to both.
51026|0|That might be because the film has already been shown on the BBC - a fact that, along with the unprepossessing production values, rather begs the question of why bother with a cinematic release at all?

47838|0|Doesn't anyone get sick of this same old routine?
34195|0|The script prepared by Mr. Huston and Richard Brooks was too full of words and highly cross-purposed implications to give the action full chance.

16737|1|Murray at his laugh-a-minute best....if there's a comedy classic, this is it
3406|1|The film is poorly directed, but it deals with a rare issue, picture brides circa 1918, and is made by an insider, an Asian-American, which is a plus.
83964|1|A generally empty, if fitfully amusing, experience.
79888|0|A noxious and gratingly insincere feature-length sitcom that'll have you stampeding toward the closest bottle of aspirin. (Or arsenic.)
19507|1|This hugely successful tear-jerker boasts some magnificent on-screen chemistry between Jack Nicholson and Shirley MacLaine.
51858|0|Even horror fans will most likely not find what they're seeking with Trouble Every Day; the movie lacks both thrills and humor.

31273|1|Adele and Ann are not easy screen characters to like, but they are easy to believe in -- especially in the skins of Sarandon and Portman.
56193|0|A singularly off-putting romantic comedy.
65155|0|After the movie scored poorly at a test screening, Miramax vice president Rick Schwartz bullied directors Efram Potelle and Kyle Rankin into playing up the comedic elements and soft-pedaling the family drama.
11479|1|Quite a bit more intelligent than most films in the genre.
4263|1|Carrey and his aggressive overbite are back, but this time he's better used as an ingredient instead of as the plot.
95162|1|...one of the most gleefully loony things you'll see this year.

48356|0|The American remake of The Vanishing adds nothing but a happy ending to the original.
26233|1|Classic performances, classic score, the best Rodgers & Hammerstein screen adaptation.
76338|0|Bereft of excitement and with action scenes similar to those we've seen a dozen times before, this is a very poor effort indeed.
39323|1|It would have been better released in the United States under its translated title, Alone, which perfectly captures the message and the mood of this slender but touching tale.

1685|1|In their devotion, fiery love scenes, and mutual respect, Neeson and Lange have made marriage more appealing and admirable than any movie has in years.
37619|1|The plot is contrived and this is hardly a believable picture of how a soap opera is made, but at least the gags are mostly funny.

58055|1|Kevin Kline's star turn as a good-yet-flawed prep school teacher is a very different take on private-school-flick cliches. ...
10564|1|It is well acted, cleverly directed, photographed and edited, but leaves one feeling hollow and feeling after seeing it.
21020|1|It's not as dark or as edgy as Tim Burton's Batman films, but it's still cleaner and more digestible. It's not a deep story, but it's full of fun nostalgia and action.
64825|1|The Red Shoes was shot in three-strip Technicolor, a process that's no longer used because of expense and technical complexity, but one that yielded some of the most spectacular images in cinema history.
63076|1|As its title suggests, this movie was dumber than the first. Unfortunately in my own little hard to please world, it was just wasn't dumb enough.
98120|1|Akira Kurosawa's social x-raying is a continuation of Ikiru

74624|1|As disgusting, harrowing, and ugly as the 1974 horror classic The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is, the film has moments of eerie beauty.
57560|1|Like a great bottle of low-cost wine, it's a sexy, silly, thrilling indulgence to satisfy your cravings.
77778|0|The kind of movie that is so deranged in every way that you legitimately cannot guess where it's going next, and sort of can't wait to see it get there.
53373|0|It's getting difficult to watch this old dog trying so hard to pull off the same old tricks; Allen is becoming a caricature of himself, a cartoon, before our very eyes.
74797|1|It's like the well-constructed house that's not meant to be distinctive, but was made to endure.
16476|1|A film that tries to mix full-out Brit humor with some deep messages about men trying to get their feelings of self-worth back. Unfortunately, it's oil and water.
70876|0|We get five minutes of halfway-decent action that hardly makes up for the other 90 minutes of this lukewarm diarreah-fest.
67352|0|Winds up seeming little more than a grisly exercise in well-calibrated acting and what one hopes are well-executed special effects.
39911|1|One of the most potent explorations of the military mind-set, irrespective of the war in question, that you'll ever see. See it.
81398|0|So unsubtle as to verge on the comical ... this didactic drama is set safely in the past and says nothing about the culture of conformity at all costs that hasn't been said before.
98439|0|Myers has his head in the toilet more than a Florida State University freshman co-ed during homecoming weekend.
85798|0|War is hell, and so are some war movies.

40099|1|Daldry coaches an astonishing performance from Bell.
50586|1|Inherently caustic and oddly whimsical, the film chimes in on the grieving process and strangely draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss.
78429|1|A good film but not a great one.
22439|0|This faux Hitchcock mystery whodunit will only have you guessing why they bothered to remake it in the first place.
49646|0|The kind of movie that gets laughs entirely unintentionally.
2686|1|The Farrellys' knack for stupid, Three Stooges-esque comedy writ larger by an infusion of heart excels with the complementary screen teaming of manic Jim Carrey and consummate screen actor Jeff Daniels. [Blu-ray]
95828|0|Daddy Day Camp truly is a horrific mess. It's not really a movie for kids; it's a movie for kids by adults who don't have the slightest idea what makes a quality film for any audience ... puerile doesn't even begin to do it justice.
79478|1|Kon Ichikawa's Fires on the Plain is another searing anti-war exercise that makes its point simply by showing the suffering and degradation of Japanese soldiers abandoned and left to their own devices in the Philippines as World War II winds down.
7489|1|The film is full of wonderful eccentrics and funny performances.
77610|0|Amid scenes of silk-sheet sexuality are gritty historical re-enactments and half-baked histrionics, but it plays as drab melodrama and unintentional comedy.

58371|0|Madea is the antithesis of the moralistic soapbox Perry's movies stand on, which is why she is usually the enjoyable ingredient in his films.

50918|0|The story has its redundancies, and the young actors, not very experienced, are sometimes inexpressive.
67009|0|I still don't understand how Brother Bear got an Oscar nomination for Best Animated film, but there are plenty of worse movies out there.
41662|1|The title and premise alone sound like every stupid comedy you've avoided for decades. Something was different %u2013 something was done right. Three other friends shared my secret shame enjoying this amiable, broad %u2013 and subtle %u2013 romantic act

32755|1|Lyrical and very touching.
51933|1|This is the one in which Fred Astaire dances on the ceiling, an impeccably executed bit of movie magic and a sublime expression of Donen's love for the medium.
4144|1|The film lapses into polarized melodrama but it's a handsome piece, displaying a fair understanding of our desperate need to belong.
73878|1|Dolls isn't a film for everybody, especially the impatient, but Kitano does succeed, I think, in drawing us into his tempo and his world, and slowing us down into the sadness of his characters.

41669|1|I found myself really quite enjoying this film, partly for its cheerful guying of mall culture. The heroine, Amy, works on a hair extension stand called Unbeweavable.
57581|1|What saves all this from being purely conventional is the filmmaker's keen sense of Rabbit's essential solitude as an artist, even when surrounded by friends.

58088|1|A subtle and penetrating work, made to look effortless; nothing is forced or pushed, so much so that it's easy to overlook the extraordinary challenges posed by Graham Greene's novel.
22053|1|Most of the film is a journey through pure Hitchcockian irony and suspense, and well worth the trip.
71156|1|Most of the male-female situations Terry finds herself in are played for laughs, and the film eventually sinks into an all too typical conclusion, but the observations regarding the nature of sexuality are interesting and well handled.
67265|0|The filmmakers maintain the illusion of low-budget cinema verite to the extent that audiences may be unsure whether to laugh or shudder...
78746|0|An action-packed mess from its lackluster, two-pronged opening segments to its final showdown.
89506|1|It's one of the best video game adaptations I've seen in years.
23199|1|A clever script and great comic timing from the entire cast take the infomercial parody to a whole new hilarious level.
86183|1|"Back when this flick was called ""Big Fish,"" it was a great movie."
78928|0|Any way you look at it, November 2 simply cannot arrive fast enough.
86959|0|A tribute to and stroking of its subject ... And by canonizing Kane, displaying this hulking angel with such innocence, the film is soulless.
67282|0|Ah, the Wachowski's were one trick ponies after all.
95228|1|By focussing the story on Harry (a leaner and slightly meaner Daniel Radcliffe) and his exploits, Yates dispenses with many of the novel's subplots and is able to push the story forward, ominously foreshadowing the dark times to come.
92984|1|Primeval walks a fine line between action, humor, and having half a conscience.
81897|1|As perceptive about youth as were the French New Wave films, and in its wide sympathy and honest outrage extends some of the rich implications of The Motorcycle Diaries.
73723|1|The result is very much worth the wait, bringing to life the mysticism of Mexico with a superb script by Guy Gallo, exquisite photography, and the unparalleled performance by Finney.
81854|0|Angry kids on an unsupervised boat trip? Constant ominous music? Gee, wonder what's going to happen next.
24655|1|About on the same level as its watchable yet uneven predecessor...
13825|1|A smart, streamlined slasher with plenty under the bonnet.
46990|1|A sometimes gripping, sometimes funny, and sometimes maddening portrait of a family that cannot deal with their internal problems.
54041|0|the worst former-beatle-tryin'-to-rape-a-woman movie ever

75436|0|If only they had a good story and enough solid thrills to sustain it for longer than a half-hour.
90017|1|Enjoyable comedy with Owen Wilson on fine comic form, this is a lot better than its trailer suggests.
22331|1|Breezy, romantic Hitchcock; an underrated gem.
66406|1|Like many underrecognized treasures, David Miller's Sudden Fear fits into and defies different genres, its convention-scrambling partly the result of the fact that the film looks both forward and back.
21810|1|A romantic drama that makes the most of the many fine dance sequences in the storyline.
13595|0|Often too pretentious to be profound.
41958|0|It doesn't have those scare-the-sh*t out of you moments, and if it doesn't have any of those, what's the point?
80613|0|Though less apocalyptical than usual, the imagery is as lavish as ever, but the film is wrecked by an underwritten narrative.
18125|1|Sharp-eyed and charming.
95374|1|Stardust is, ultimately, a pretty entertaining movie. It's just not the great film that it so easily could have been.
15234|0|Like the TV series, the pic features makeup and special-effects gimmickry that are far less persuasive than what might be found at second-rate theme-park attractions.
59418|1|Colorful disaster movie with good teaming of Tracy and Sinatra.
54289|0|As fun as talking babies were, the buck stops here with talking dogs. Gone is the witty humour and sexual innuendo of the first film, and in it's place is a script just ripe for any 8 year old, but stale to anyone in the double digits.
16002|1|LaBute directs this low-budget film with such spareness and precision, using such minimal yet effective backdrops, that in retrospect his color film almost seems to have been in black and white. Its ideas are that stark.
65802|0|Makes Michael Moore look like Marcel Ophüls
75041|0|There's something distinctly sour-tasting in how long the film lingers on its characters doubling-down on their awkwardness.
22181|0|The last blast of the summer is an exuberantly cheesy action opus featuring Jean-Claude Van Damme and Rob Schneider as an improbable pair of gung-ho heroes.
55800|0|The Banger Sisters is not a terrible film but ultimately a missed opportunity, an opportunity to show the outcomes of those deluded Band-Aids from Almost Famous, or even as a demonstration of the inevitable paths of people whose experiences peaked when th
44882|0|This movie needed something to give it a fresh spin.
61081|1|The actors in Unknown Pleasures generate sympathy from their sullen good looks as much as any acting ability.
25297|1|This idiosyncratic movie succeeds as a delightful comedy, a sexy romance, and a clever cross-cultural study.
50016|1|...A seriously weird and intriguing psychological drama.
35245|1|A dead-on rumination of love and loss... [that] suggests a delicate painting come to life or a bunch of wistful old Polaroids scattered on a living room floor.
74449|1|A withering hip check against machismo.
11448|1|A comedy classic that only misses out on the Python canon's top spot because the talented swines also made Life Of Brian.
76643|0|The World of Suzie Wong, despite its familiar story and seductive packaging, never quite escapes the glaring contradiction between its professed egalitarianism and the obvious inequalities it so blithely reproduces.
55746|1|"Director Juan Jose Campanella could have turned this into an Argentine retread of ""Iris"" or ""American Beauty,"" but instead pulls a little from each film and creates something more beautiful than either of those films."
81155|1|Cavani uses a seedy, spying camera and beautiful European locations to draw us into the action and dress it up as art. She's a sick puppy, but she's good at what she does.
46193|0|Just sort of lays there for long stretches like a dead weasel.
22823|1|a big heap of fun
59370|1|Costa-Gavras tells this heartbreaking tale of lost opportunity with an emotional restraint that makes it all the more powerful.
56565|0|More than annoyed, or angry, I just felt sad. Sad for what is quite possibly the premature death of a once-brilliant directorial career.
71003|1|The event around which the movie revolves is a desert mirage, since there is no record of any such race ever being staged. Nonetheless, those able to ignore this outrageous historical distortion might enjoy this triumph of an underdog aganst the odds.
53030|0|Hawke's film, a boring, pretentious waste of nearly two hours, doesn't tell you anything except that the Chelsea Hotel today is populated by whiny, pathetic, starving and untalented artistes.
5663|1|A thoughtful romantic comedy with a snappy hook.
38573|1|"Excellent anti-war flick from Austrailian ""new wave"""
79739|1|Silly, but good fun.
20192|1|It's a bizarre relationship, tender and respectful with a suggestively incestuous undercurrent that pulls at the story, like a schizophrenic, drug addled take on Tennessee Williams
74780|1|The great cast mirthfully brings on the savage dialogue and relishes in the malicious nature of the satire.
4633|1|Scorcese drew seminal and genuinely creepy performances from his stars in this thriller remake.
66364|0|Very, very violent horror flick.
96431|1|a strange flick

72768|1|Not the greatest thing since sliced bread, but an effective thriller.
35806|1|An interesting little movie.
4395|1|The thriller framework is still familiar, but the results exhibit a welcome freshness.
71545|0|Fails to meet the expectations of its own conceit.
95891|1|I really enjoyed what [it] had to offer with takes on morals, war, and the damage violence can do to people in its grasp...
60126|0|The performances are convincing, and sufficiently nuanced to elevate the characters beyond mere cliché.
51466|0|The elements with which the Farrellys transcend mere gross-out -- pacing, inspired and quirky performances, good writing with an underlying heart -- are missing here, which exposes the underlying creepiness at the heart of the film.
95580|0|"Whoever thought that ""Bratz"" deserved the attention of this screenplay should be spanked."
55290|1|"Less an ""Elvis film"" than a western starring young Presley in a surprisingly well cast role, this lean frontier drama... offers one of his most impressive performances."
26861|1|Nicely gets the job done as either a showcase for Jet Li's athletic talents or an undemanding blast of action and mayhem.
46043|1|Turns a satirical eye on Reagan's hawkish heart, the sprung logic of Italian zombie movies, and John Hughes' brat-pack films.
27663|0|...could have been a superb dark fantasy, but takes its own malarkey seriously.
28389|1|Hilarious.
26876|1|A first-rate documentary about an exploit that almost defies belief.
73990|0|Mushy
81961|0|An overreaching satire that even Lee's biggest fans will find disappointing.
65507|1|What's most interesting about Paper Moon is that it has the tone and timbre of a comedy, but the setting and style of the film are somber and more reminiscent of a European art film.
23882|1|Some funny parts, but kids may not be interested.
9237|1|"Widely considered one of the greatest movie musicals of all time, Vincent Minnelli's ""The Band Wagon"" connects a jumble of comedic backstage Broadway shenanigans with mix-matched show tunes via Fred Astaire's impeccable dance routines."
71150|0|Aside from a few moments of quiet pathos that ring true, Avelino's directorial debut is a calculated piece of cinematic outrage marred by on-the-nose dialogue and melodramatic contrivance.
89277|1|While nowhere near as witty as Shaun of the Dead (2004), it has a rude energy and a go-for-broke willingness to try anything.
69768|0|"Ben Stiller is either a member of Dysfunctions R Us, or else he's making a plea to be the next Woody Allen -- but even Allen himself couldn't save ""Along Came Polly"""
58814|1|... one of the most strikingly pictorial movies ever made.
32564|0|Os excessos visuais de Stone (tão bem utilizados em seus trabalhos anteriores) e o fraco terceiro ato, mais conveniente do que o apropriado, comprometem o resultado final.
14909|0|Listening to Fran Drescher's nasal squawk for an entire movie is the price you'll pay to see The Beautician and the Beast. Imagine having your ear canal scoured with Brillo. Only more abrasive.
20083|0|"Yeah, I know, I know: It's considered an action classic and routinely pegged as one of the best ""buddy cop"" films, but it's always held just marginal appeal for me -- besides, compare it to Die Hard, and its ""classic"" status seems even more ludicrous."
97617|0|It's deplorable that these two stars have been reduced to appearing in such garbage.
38437|0|...so enigmatic and mysterious that by the time the movie's over, you still aren't entirely sure what just happened.
32724|0|We end up getting thin supporters as seen through the eyes of a main character that doesn't do anything.
13430|0|The humor is relentlessly cruel, smug, and disconnected from any sense of how human beings might behave in similar situations.
61161|0|This teen chick flick is just too cloying for words.
35346|1|"Inherit the Wind (1960) portrays the famous and dramatic courtroom ""Monkey Trial"" battle (in the summer of 1925 in Dayton, Tennessee)"
68524|0|Dated, unconventional rock opera has some violence.
90387|0|What becomes painfully apparent as the drudgery rolls on is that the only freak show here is the movie itself.
3006|1|Classy film noir, as you would expect from a team including director Barbet Schroeder, writer Richard Price, and Nicolas Cage...
85348|0|The film is made in the internet equivalent of capital letters and its simplistic morality stands out on the big screen more so than on the small page.
21437|1|Perfect.
80137|1|One of the highlight's of Vincent Price's later career, a film that fused his reputation as a horror star with his penchant for self-parody.
53|0|Whitney Houston's alleged dramatic acting and dull, uninvolving storyline weighs down the virtues of the film.
36201|1|Guys and Dolls is a bangup filmusical in the topdrawer Goldwyn manner.
54492|1|Sean Connery is still up to par as James Bond in the latest adventure of Agent 007.
62648|1|Director Frank Perry's cult favorite
63544|0|The kids will like its simplicity and manic motion, but if you want more than that, you won't find it here.
9651|1|Cat On a Hot Tin Roof (1958) is the powerful, highly-charged, moving story of a neurotic, dysfunctional Southern family
43286|0|You get the sense that many of the characters and much of the raucous familial wrangling would have worked better in a theatrical setting.
22904|1|It's a beautifully structured piece with a high quotient of neat, shocking twists. Director David Dobkin exercises welcome restraint; although the movie is full of macabre touches, it's witty rather than grotesque.
39605|0|may actually show its strength by being average
51945|0|It plays like a by-the-numbers action flick that happens to have a few funny lines in it. It is barely watchable.
21551|1|It's a story as old as time redone in books and films over and over again. But this one's got the one-of-a-kind Henson vision and style.
42997|0|Hollywood needs to realize that it's not the '40s anymore; women don't need a man to be happy.
60793|1|Perhaps director Monte Hellman's finest film.
49027|1|Bridges completely steals the show from the more lauded Spacey, who's simply on autopilot throughout.
3270|1|Nell will startle you with its poignant message that we can all be angels bringing grace and trust and light into each other's lives.
31753|1|An immensely-successful film whose vein of strong black humour disguises its criticisms of American morals and society.
35558|0|This enormous wheeze comes over like the proverbial movie with a 40 million dollar set and a five cent script, which may hold its interest for under-fives but will leave most others cold.
38445|0|This film is probably really only best for fans of vampire films or stylish British erotic thrillers.
75127|0|Altman's staging only underlines the pretentious vagaries built into Shepard's concept.
77513|1|Reilly is perhaps the most amazing fusion of boy and man we have in American movies.
5073|1|Dazed and Confused is a perfect movie. It flawlessly captures the spirit of the '70s while arguing for a clear universality in the high school experience.
2512|1|It's refreshing to revisit the jester in his screen infancy, when all he wanted was to boogie to a Culture Club hit, carry on conversations with hair care products, and sit on a sprinkler.
61573|0|There's a lot of fluff in this comedy, but it's mostly harmless fluff. Yes, there are times that the women seem objectified, but they also have moments of empowerment to balance the scales.
4951|0|Paint-by-numbers sequel that will bore even fans of the original.
98021|1|We haven't had a good vagina dentata movie in theaters lately, so it's a pleasure to see Teeth filling that particular need with such obvious relish and style.
58843|1|Disarming black comedy-drama stands out among others in the pack because its offbeat plot turns make it hard for the viewer to match a rhythm to it
72473|1|Measured and meditative, the Japanese film Maborosi draws the viewer, without emotional bludgeoning or manipulation, into the experience of a woman who has suffered a devastating personal loss.
97361|1|Call me hokey if you want. I just would have liked more heart in there somewhere. But the acting is superb and it's worth seeing just for that. By no means watch this over the holidays but pursue its scholarly merit on safe ground.
4250|1|The climactic punch-up fails to match the power of the first film's true ending, but in deconstructing his own bastardised creation, Craven redeems both the series and his own tarnished reputation.
43719|0|beautiful to look at and listen to but it has a cold heart.
85914|1|Director Carroll Ballard ... not only captures stellar images of nature, but feels the call of the wild in his bones.
2919|1|Has been done to death, but there's something endearingly goofy about throwing Einstein, of all people, into the mix that breathes new life into the formula.
44687|1|Pootie is such an original, utterly absurd conception that, however one may hesitate over superfluous matters of good taste or (horrors!) political correctness, anyone with an ounce of humor will find it impossible not to succumb in gales of laughter.
21791|1|A quiet, thoughtful movie about hard moral choices, truth, love, accountability, crime, punishment and friendship.
31208|1|Awesome mystery. The afterlife subplot works perfectly and sells the surprise twist.
64092|1|Both Martin and Novak are at their near best, and the undertone of small-town desperation in Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond's script is effectively captured by Walston and his sidekick, Cliff Osmond.
61339|1|The next time I hear a payphone ringing, I definitely won't pick it up.
23567|1|Without [Blanchett], Kapur's extravagant history lesson (written by Michael Hirst) blurs into dark doings among men in tights.
30501|1|Check out the scene where Caine and Green discuss the merits of button mushrooms and you'll appreciate that, as the actors have an excellent grasp of character, so the screenwriters have a superb eye for detail.
13968|1|"Inspired by the real story of classical pianist David Helfgott, ""Shine"" re-creates that emotionally piercing story, note by memorable note."
10947|0|[Stone] is the very best thing about this often disappointing, frantically sexy and, ultimately, unpalatable thriller.
49380|1|Martin Lawrence amuses in raunchy comedy.
47547|1|A fun and oddly entertaining twist on the road trip film.
22149|1|Unlike some past De Palma films, though, The Untouchables makes some of its strongest impressions in sequences that build suspense and characterization without readily resorting to mayhem.
17438|1|This bright and touching drama celebrates diversity as one of the enchantments of life.
89141|1|A fascinating look at this epically tortured artist.
15020|0|Neither the film's smug white bigots nor its uniformly noble blacks are well served by such oversimplification.
69709|0|With plenty of girl-on-girl action, this is the movie that photographer David Hamilton would love to make.
7238|1|Worth the time for its occasional nuggets of interesting action, and the performance by Berenger.
54158|1|Wish I'd seen it on the big screen!
56470|1|If the screen version of White Oleander was an Olympic event, it's hard to tell which of the movie's four actresses would end up winning the gold.
77447|0|These babies need a time out.
47771|0|Immature humor, sexism in trite '90s sequel.
47115|0|This movie sucks so bad, I didn't even like it in the 80s.
62601|0|Overpraised first effort by Coppola
36896|1|All the individual pieces assemble into a piercing look at the music and the rave.
98046|0|"Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins feels like a rudimentary retread of previously outrageous ""black attack"" farces... needlessly cluttered, unfocused and pointless..."
57128|1|Ultimately, Ms. 45 is far more interesting and genuinely enjoyable (versus ironically enjoyable, as many of this vintage grindhouse flicks wind up being) than it has any right to be.
46719|0|There have been a lot of movies about how fake Hollywood is, but this is the fake Hollywood movie about how fake Hollywood is.
57666|0|[Egoyan is] so careful telling the story of the genocide that much of the film feels cold and didactic, like watching a slide show in a lecture hall.
28232|0|This relentlessly depressing film biography boasts a moving performance by Jessica Lange.
14348|1|The halting romance between Maguire and Dorothy -- he fearing intimacy, she admiring his budding humanity -- is one of the film's surpassing pleasures. The excellent supporting cast is another.
40639|1|An engaging feature, smartly cast, while showing a little more sophistication than the genre typically receives. It's too bad Norris couldn't make a few more of these before the Cannon Films curse claimed his marquee value for good.
12640|1|A touching burst of patriotism; with wonderful performances by Washington and Broderick. A film worthy of remembering and repeated viewing.
44045|1|There's not much depth here, but Nichols does a fine job with the surface effects, and the wisecracks keep coming.
70037|1|The film is breezy, musical and utterly charming.
85189|1|LaChapelle does an admirable job avoiding a pitfall by staving off pretense. He frames an unobtrusive canvas for the performers to stroke with flailing arms and jiggling hips
8988|1|Ginormous in both scale and emotional wallop, MGM's epic is still a cinematic event to be savoured.
101062|1|A dumb, dumb film, to be sure, but also undeniably funny in more spots than a right-thinking, mature adult person feels comfortable admitting.
695|0|All Disney has really done in its disappointing 33rd animated feature is revive the stereotype of the Noble Savage.
44886|0|Perhaps if you send them a stamped, self-addressed envelope they'll tell us why this was thought to be funny.
43474|0|No matter how bad a movie with A-list actors involved is, it will still be released - somewhere, sometime, to someone.
79408|1|Jean Cocteau's scripting and directing give the film its proper key of unworldliness.
81991|1|An entertaining and penetrating look at the creative process
23695|0|There just aren't enough laughs to distract from the vast fault-lines in the story
32185|0|R&H exists as it does simply because U2 had “planned” too much ahead of time, the antithesis of spontaneity and the killjoy of documentary filmmaking.
55668|0|Tabu is deliberate and forced in its playfulness, cheaply melodramatic in its tragedy, and unconscionably long-winded.
51444|1|There's real chemistry between Bacall and Peck, which Minnelli emphasizes in carefully observed intimacies and brusque banter alike.
57257|0|Trust me, I'm laughing at you, guys, not with you.
92340|1|This is a considered film that lacks the immediacy of a blunt message like the more simplistic Super Size Me, or the punchy, smokescreen climax of a film like Syriana to send the audience out feeling enlightened.
93915|1|Performances by Sandler and Cheadle give the film enough of what it needs in order to recommend it.
84415|0|Dour, dry Duchovny's directorial debut is more weepy than creepy, a conventional coming-of-age story that flashes back to 1970s New York City.
81482|1|There is violence -- the gritty, bloody kind, not the balletic jumping off walls variety -- but it is kept firmly in its place and never allowed to take over.
45939|1|I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I liked this movie. The Coreys were actually funny in this one.
35520|0|The movie's unintentionally played like a comedy all the way.
99340|0|Director H.S. Miller thinks he's made something broodingly visionary when you're more likely to be aesthetically shaken up by one of Mad magazine's Fold-Ins.
58497|1|True bandos can see themselves in this exuberant, charismatic and lovingly accurate college marching-band movie that faked no flavor while staying in step with themes of instruction, character and respect.
87929|1|A big part of the movie's success is Huffman's irresistible and remarkable performance as Bree, a character we identify with rather than feel alienated by.
88900|0|If the animation studio Blue Sky has proven anything so far, it's that they're big league visual artists, but frankly pedestrian when it comes to stories.
82834|0|Although it can't have been easy, director Law Wing-cheong manages to defuse Yen's charismatic skill as a martial artist.
51983|0|The Field is a movie that all too often reveals its origins as a play.
14747|0|The Strangers has a couple of scares, but it's not anywhere near as frightening as advertised. The creepy folks of the title are more fumbling than fiendish.
46209|1|Einstein has a handsome period look, even when director of photography Jeff Darling is shooting the musical montages that periodically break up the action.
10088|0|Much as I admire Costner, it is the very qualities of honesty, honor and sincerity he projects so forcefully that encumber this Robin.
16337|0|You'll be shocked to discover how much of the novel's richness has been lost.
50173|0|Mangold should have done a bit more research with the screenplay, not to mention metaphysics.
46463|0|Yet another (over)extended rock video masquerading as an Asian art film from Hong Kong's shade-laden king of cool.
63531|1|A visually exhilarating mix of hand-drawn and computer-generated images that sets sail with a rather mediocre and clichéd script.
11191|1|Even though nothing much happens during the course of the movie (Valerie spends over half the running time wandering around the inside of a hotel), this is a thoroughly engrossing motion picture.
59951|1|A spirited romp of self-deprecation and beheadings that might not hold appeal to the ordinary viewer, but remains absolute catnip to Campbell fans.
36911|0|There is a nightmare quality to its best scenes, but the film is essentially a great half-hour Twilight Zone padded out to feature length.
37782|1|Carl Franklin tackles American anxieties--interracial love, guilt and denial--that have been ignored, showing understanding of his characters, all conflicted in vvarious ways.
38345|1|A movie for those in love with the rave scene, and those who are just curious.
42436|0|Though it's obvious after five minutes that this is a complete no-no, the cinema equivalent of a bellyflop, it exercises a perverse fascination
99147|1|"Fortunately for filmgoers, the sight of Bill Maher laying the smacketh down on God is, to quote Homer Simpson, truly ""sacrilicious""."
75908|1|Mr. Dickerson, whose cinematography has been the reason Spike Lee's films look so good, has a terrific eye and some juice of his own.
11057|0|Whoosh!! Days of Thunder just streaked in, fast as a race-car paint job and about as flat.
90833|0|There is practically no plot, and even less character development, but the script is based on a novel, most likely a thin one.

61303|1|Ao contrário do impecável anti-herói do original, Nick Nolte confere vulnerabilidade ao protagonista e, no processo, leva esta refilmagem a superar a produção de 1955.
53532|1|This is a classic Corman drive-in picture combining crime-movie spectacle, period color and sexploitation diversions between the capers...
40061|1|Fables for a less saturated and cynical age, 'The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad' deserves more than it has received.
43575|1|The film takes you slowly and confidently to the labyrinth of denial that often accompanies horrific loss.
66137|1|It feels like it should be cheesy and manipulative, but the utter sincerity lifts it immeasurable.
60307|0|Dead Man Walking if written by Charlie Kaufman.
24456|1|Turner is terrific, Douglas is fine and the action is slam-bang. Add lots of laughs and it all works out just right.
75338|1|Rather than living on as reminder of India in the early 1900s, the film now exists as a period piece of another sort, namely, as a cult film of the psychedelic era.
36803|0|Just a cut above the typical, but it goes without saying: your mileage may vary. [Blu-ray]
32902|0|An interesting failure that promises more than it delivers.
22326|1|swift pace and dry humor far more entertaining than most late night offerings
68397|1|David Lynch does it again.....a hot, heavy, hellish movie
27582|0|The result? A cautionary tale about boys and their toys and what happens when a star, Will Smith, and a director, Barry Sonnenfeld, are given way too much money to play with.
93505|0|A veritÃ (C) riff on the â~Police Academyâ(TM) series is the idea behind cult US sitcom â~Reno 911!â(TM), which, here, is stretched to breaking point for this puerile punt at cinematic glory.
90008|0|This is one of the worst scripts in the history of major-studio motion pictures: inconsistent, undeveloped, predictable, poorly thought-out -- hopeless on every level.
101381|0|The actors once again work well together, but they should have quit when they were ahead.
61840|1|... Identity is a rarity: a good movie made better by a twist you won't see coming.
4709|1|At its best, it's a valentine of venom, sent with mirth and malice aforethought.
89028|0|Aquamarine is pleasant enough and perfect for its target demographic, but it's a run of the mill movie that wouldn't stand out among the various cable TV offerings for its audience.

36278|0|Its charms, such as they are, are all on the surface -- beautiful faces, beautiful clothes, deluxe interiors and lots of breaking glass -- while its story makes no sense whatsoever.
100864|0|Stylized, slapdash sci-fi bloodbath is gory and grim.
87557|0|The failure is with a script as ungainly as it is and an oversimplified conception of American-Italian and black cultures.
43324|1|You cannot look away from him. The performance is so . . . strange.
41248|1|...the film version of the stage hit is an old-fashioned charmer.
13519|1|Fine escapist entertainment.
93177|0|A painful regurgitation of memorable moments from recent Hollywood blockbusters, the spoof film Epic Movie is almost entirely devoid of laughs.
48587|0|A bland affair with none of the imagination that distinguishes the best horror movies.
99494|1|entertaining and even a little mischievous, it finds perverse outcomes, but no villains. It is informative, without creating partisanship, respectful without being patronizing, entertaining without being dumbed-down
83693|0|This movie already has enough topics on the table. As a result, none gets the attention it deserves.
26920|0|Still shufflin' around
25467|1|How is the film anything other than its own besotted yet savage review of cinema?
45805|0|The characters are simply postulated, given whole, from the start; there`s no depth or development in the performances; and each scene exists only to make a single plot point.
11174|0|Generation X-ers continue to feel superior about their teen films...adding intelligence & darkness can make a generic teen romp into a rewatchable touchstone. Not Sleepover.
18481|1|This charming, Capraesque political fable demonstrates the viability of Warren Beatty as writer, director and star; it's his last decent film.
84208|0|But add up these formidable parts and all you get is still a distant story of wealthy and miserable French literati stewing in their own self-contempt.

18193|1|Pedro Almodovar has done something nearly unheard of: he has made a wheelchair movie without maudlin sentiment and overbearing importance. Even better, it's actually rather enjoyable.
56834|1|Really darn great by slasher standards, and even kind of pretty good by the standards of decent, functional, God-fearing modes of cinema.
36698|1|I absolutely loved this film. It's like musical cotton candy, a feast of great songs and dance numbers and bright colors.
33861|1|A confident movie that tackles a worthwhile topic with insight and conviction.
85333|1|A hugely enjoyable, superbly directed film with a cracking script and a terrific central performance from Romain Duris.
55632|0|Ludicrous monkey caper has loads of potty humor.
36635|0|There are points in the movie where you think you're ready to laugh, but, like the movie as a whole, they don't amount to much.
48403|1|George Pal's production is better remembered for its apocalyptic special effects than for the perfunctory dialogue, but the gripping story keeps you watching.
60617|0|By the time Laurel Canyon closes, we're left with a number of dangling subplots, lots of questions and two hideously unbelievable reconciliations.
32119|1|A truly remarkable film. It is just not for everyone.
71715|1|Whatever film acting is about -- technique, presence or truth-telling -- [Esther Gorintin] got it.
95117|1|Laughs are thin on the ground, but this is a must-see by a film-maker at the height of his powers.
8456|1|Altman loves to explode movie genres, and his script, co-written with Frank Barhydt, fuses the classic '30s screwball comedy and crime film.
5324|1|An impressive technical achievement--the period New York sets are to die for -- and its version of the invention of the hula-hoop is a comic highlight.
24391|1|It's awesome
61608|1|To my surprise the film was incredibly entertaining and turned what is essentially a book geared toward young readers into a film that will resonate with audiences of any age.
17715|1|A Wizard of Oz construct in the same way as Apocalypse Now is a Wizard of Oz construct.
99289|1|A great film to catch with your girlfriends or loved one. Mc Dreamy does not disappoint on the big screen.
78593|1|"The film even manages to pull off a hilarious comic song (""Now that we're men!""), as well as providing new additions to playground vocabulary such as ""Knuckleheaded McSpazatron""."
38906|1|Like a lot of great comedy, I'm the One rises from the ashes of genuine pain while still being funny.
91069|1|"an eccentric, audacious musical that, like ""Moulin Rouge,"" blends backstage drama, tragic romance and flights of fantasy into a story that bravely jumps from genre to genre and from era to era."

25861|1|Towering Inferno's glass-spangled erection burns with an uncontrollable lust for spectacle.
60774|1|The contrivance of plot is compensated by one of the most genial casts in history.
65285|0|Not as disposable as we first think, and ultimately watchable once we get past an hour that's only marginally less damaging than a 'Diff'rent Strokes' marathon - but it's not exactly inspired either.
12052|1|Since its release, this intelligent, atmospheric film has been warmly received by audiences responding not only to their own childhood, but also to the heroic image portrayed by Peck, a shining example of citizenship and affectionate fatherhood.
71722|0|Mutterings and short clipped dialogues in ellipses may convey reality but are hard on a movie audience.
7281|1|Awkwardness, the first kiss, parents from the stone age and having a nose the size of Jupiter have never been so compelling as in this fresh and funny film
12428|1|Educational, exciting action, great acting.
60247|1|One has to say this for The Man Who Fell to Earth: such a bold, imaginative work would never get made in today's fettered, cautious film industry, either here or in America. Roeg's work may have its faults - but its ambition is beyond reproach.
3457|0|It seems like a very long wait to get to the various punch lines.
22504|1|intelligent character study of a mythologized athlete
24387|0|An endless parade of people glowering, being pensive, skulking, but with all the sonic and visual trappings of a trashy action movie insisting that it's big noisome fun.

78702|1|Moments of astonishing greatness followed by yawn-inducing romance.
40553|1|Ang Lee's crowd-pleasing martial arts actioner is captivating and thrilling from beginning to end.
61172|1|I loved this film for what it didn't try to do.
26148|0|The movie is full of nonsensical plot twists, embarrassingly broad performances and unappealing characters.
52478|1|Another ethical exploration by Davd Mamet, this time looking at the meaning of integrity.
56512|0|aside from showing us in explicit detail how difficult it is to win over the two-drink-minimum crowd, there's little to be learned from watching 'Comedian'
15853|1|Moore's typically prickly demeanor, often cited by her detractors as her biggest liability as an actress, actually works to her advantage here, as she unearths the voracious ambition in Jordan's soul.
72479|1|A particular delight for opera fans, though colorfully engaging to everyone.
23822|1|The result is a happy blend of smart-aleck humor and wacky adventure.
13624|1|"But in a ""comedy horror"" picture, the ""horror"" bits aren't supposed to be this scary. He would have been better off dispensing with the comedy altogether."
87419|1|A sturdily conventional biopic.
16803|1|This film offers an honest portrait of the media in action, as it also depicts a public that is more interested in being entertained than being informed.
19165|1|Major thread of gaiety runs through the proceedings, and McCarey has liberally sprinkled sparkling individual episodes along the way for cinch audience reaction.
41193|0|Feels even more remote than its location.
27400|1|Highly enjoyable, great looking animated adventure that combines its touching storyline with plenty of wit and style.
76790|0|Kids of all sizes and genders are going to be disappointed.
25458|1|Michael Powell's Peeping Tom is the best movie ever made about the voyeuristic allure of making and watching movies.
28594|1|Thanks largely to Chevy Chase's zaniness and comic timing this is a very funny movie.
14510|1|Painstakingly, breathtakingly re-created by director Michael Mann, this landscape makes room for heroes with principles greater than the circumference of their biceps.
3768|1|A movie by, about and for actors.
14779|1|As the outsider who courts the mentally ill Mary Stuart Masterson, Johnny Depp renders a startling performance that elevates the romantic fable way above its writing and directing shortcomings; look for the young Julianne Moore in a small part.
82204|1|The movie is simultaneously conventional and subversive, broad and nuanced, shamelessly manipulative and genuinely moving, a cheap sucker punch and a work of real moral weight.
55392|1|...A showcase for excellent acting by some older, established performers and also some newer faces.
77044|0|'Una de esas películas intrascendentes, de las que da lo mismo que existan o no'
64167|0|Even fans of the first two films may find the proceedings pretty tiresome, but then they made those movies into hits, so anything's possible.
60603|0|'We're left with a film that doesn't create enough interest in what went on in those Laurel Canyon backyards to justify pulling over and watching.'
100453|1|Like Malick, Nichols knows that the sight of a combine transforming an Arkansas cotton field into an apocalyptic dust storm is as eloquent as anything his characters might say.
87574|1|Slightly pretentious, but original enough to be a bit interesting, and buoyed by strong performances from Depp and Morton, The Libertine is a decent telling of a historical footnote, most interesting because of its strong feminist message.
24172|0|It's one thing to be offbeat, and another thing entirely to be off-pitch.
72088|0|"Pitched as a homage to George Cukor's 1949 classic romantic comedy ""Adam's Rib"" (with Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy), ""Laws of Attraction"" is far separated from that film's exceptional timing and sincere comic exploration of a competitive couple of"
60915|1|Dickensian in its empathy with the poor, uncompromising in its realism and ambitious in both scope and technique, this debut feature from Mira Nair is one of the most arresting studies of street life ever made.
66234|1|Non-stop action of the highest quality.
23240|1|Just flat out amazing.
58386|0|Perry brings his own sensibility to every movie he makes and has enjoyed great success by following his own path. But he leaves you wanting more.
93247|1|If Hannibal Rising catches fire, it may spark a new literary trend with Hollywood aspirations--i.e., when old monsters were kids

89199|1|Until now, you may not have considered Penelope Cruz the modern-day successor to Barbara Stanwyck and Joan Crawford. But director Pedro Almodovar's delightful 'Volver' could change your mind.
79263|1|Caustic and chaotic in the arch Sturges manner, it's probably his funniest and most smilingly malicious film.
76488|1|Better suspense than many sports movies, in spite of clichés and anachronisms
81844|1|This movie about teens is for adults only.
42374|1|It's fun.
92653|0|Ironically, the film features almost zero teaching. Despite much pedagogical posturing, it doesn't teach us much, either.
28241|0|Unfortunately though the story glosses over some of the big details in Farmer's life.
86244|1|A nifty piece of low-ambition entertainment that knows exactly what it is, and delivers fairly well on its promises.
426|0|... Will not give its viewers much of an idea of the Shakespeare play, and may inadvertently give them other ideas, about interracial love, that were not much on Shakespeare's mind.
53686|0|As [the characters] get more depressed, the story gets more tiresome, especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound.
100854|0|There's a version of Henry Poole is Here that I would've liked to see, and the painful thing is that it's not that far off from the real thing.

64914|1|Mantendo seus habituais comentários políticos em segundo plano, Yimou narra uma história de amor simples, mas tocante, trazendo Zhang Ziyi numa performance absolutamente adorável.
80111|1|A compelling drama about morality under fire in the life of a middle-aged business man
99081|1|An unapologetically old-fashioned fantasy ... solid enough entertainment for grown-ups, but something that many kids will absolutely adore.
78989|1|Greed (1924) is one of the greatest silent films ever made, although the film was a box-office failure at the time. The 'lost' film masterpiece
38120|1|It's near sadistic how the film has him going though so much tragedy and self-questioning, but Gibson delivers emotionally.
99156|0|It's a fun idea, but quite awkwardly staged and, in the end, not particularly engaging.
8140|0|Good shorts don't make good features...
20835|1|A very good film with an intriguing and disturbing message.

52747|1|"""Changing Lanes"" asks how far we'd go not to lose what's ours, but it's a morality play with hope for détente rather than any destructive force. Gavin and Doyle are two severely flawed men whose best intentions are knocked about by their worst impulses."
13178|1|The Brooks of 'Young Frankenstein' isn't really skewering the conventions of the horror movie - he's paying tribute to them, and using them as scaffolding for his particular brand of goofy, Borscht Belt burlesque.
76616|1|A playful experiment.
53481|1|Though not one of Rohmer best films, it's worth seeing for the acting and the dialogue which magnify the glory of the French language. Amazingly, at 81, Rohmer continues to be productive; rejection of film by Cannes Festival stirred controversy in 2001

50581|1|At times, Tsai's approach makes viewing this film like watching paint dry, but what a sublime design it makes.
102236|1|Igor celebrates a defiantly adolescent and suitably caricatured vision of mortality with the potential to have adults and special young malcontents in stitches.
36370|1|Charles Chaplin's 1952 film is overlong, visually flat, episodically constructed, and a masterpiece.
69867|1|It makes for OK drama all the same, but it's all on the heavy-handed side. Well, subtlety was never Kramer's strong suit.
57710|1|Barry convinces us he's a dangerous, secretly unhinged guy who could easily have killed a president because it made him feel powerful.
3104|1|Lange is outstanding...very rewarding
27832|0|There's very little energy in the follow-through, and this time Murray's listlessness seems more anemic than comic.

66077|1|Features a host of fine character portrayals and a compelling climax that compensates for its length.
96616|1|The subtlety of the interplay among the three generations of women is extraordinary.
7288|1|The film accurately captures that age-old teenage irony that the worst years of your life are also freakishly the best.
82377|1|This, incidentally, is one of the rare movies about authors in which the character's writing actually seems good enough to be publishable.
93285|1|For all the sleights of hand its director conjures up, this is an undeniably slight affair. But it's still a sublimely entertaining one from a maverick confident enough in his abilities to make fun of his previous work and his agent provocateur persona.
65266|0|It's never as funny as we'd like, and the characters seem too cartoony to hook us.
86498|1|Give me an aged archaeologist with a whip any day over a gun-toting secret agent sipping Martinis under the code-name of 007.

46006|1|...a plodding, downright generic buddy-cop thriller that's simply unable to sustain the viewer's interest for more than a few minutes at a time.
20469|1|Steven Spielberg's film is not perfect: it plays its strongest card first, the middle section is slightly uneven, and there are sallies into sentimentality. But it is a modern war classic.
27359|0|Freeman seems to have spent much time lining up the plotlines, but somewhere along the way forgot to impart grit and substance to his characters.

100914|0|Without Anna Faris - undoubtedly the best thing in Scary Movies - this would be just another superficial wheeze about the perils of superficiality.
35600|1|Director Alan Parker's right. His 1978 riveting prison drama still holds up.
16730|1|The balance of the film consists of time-tested commercial material, most of which is still working fine.
1462|0|The story of Frank McCourt's triumph makes it to the screen intact. It's the lyricism, the heartbeat, that seem to be missing.
38639|0|There's no magic here, only incompetence.
22035|1|May or may not rank with Hitch's greatest masterpieces, but its premise offers perhaps the most compelling variation on his favorite theme, the innocent man wrongly accused.
49009|0|The sexual content diverts attention away from what is some very powerful acting by the film's talented cast.
6998|1|A down-the-line thriller, plain, fast and efficient.
87521|0|A tiresome piece of claptrap masquerading as family drama.
76379|0|It is the sort of movie whose vapidity is exposed as soon as the clutter is removed.
99020|0|You have to be 12 to like it, and I have to say there is little or nothing here to remind us why we were all quite so excited about The Matrix.
75491|0|This X doesn't mark the spot.

79100|1|"Capra advocates populism and egalitarianism, underlined by values of Christianity. For him, every person is ""God's creation"" in his/her own right, evert person possesses some talent and should do his/her best with that gift."
18387|0|The characters and their emotions are painted with a big, sloppy brush. Texas-sized.
12622|1|Exceptionally well-rendered and emotive war drama.
91120|0|The underwhelming drama contains echoes of so many other indie flicks that anything original is all but drowned out.
70225|0|Cool World isn't difficult to watch (there's too much insanity floating around to be bored), it's just impossible to digest, absent any grounded activities that could elevate the viewing experience past weirdo cartoon diarrhea.
93096|1|Funny, gentle, unpatronising, if occasionally naive and quirky.
82819|1|...the movie is more concerned with the characters than with the sport. So it's a movie for anyone to enjoy.
69533|1|Connelly, who has often mistaken posing for acting, digs deep here; Aghdashloo ... gives us a portrait of a woman who is both dutiful to her husband and ravaged by his iron will. Kingsley is most impressive of all.
96523|0|A hellish and unconvincing celebration of badda-bing-ness.
101959|0|Saw V may still have the power to make audiences squirm, but only for the most obvious reasons.
1854|1|War Games in the water; older teens and up.
61298|1|While Jordan's repeated freeze-frames try a little too hard for nonchalance, the overall cocktail of Gallic insouciance and American film noir grit delivers such relaxant properties you forgive a few foibles.
59798|1|[An] often maligned, giddy, superlative romantic musical.

35259|1|The film as a whole means no more than Charlie Chaplin means. Nobody has ever been able to say what that is, but by the present showing it is something quite timeless and priceless, and more human than the best of alien words lugged in for definition.
29737|1|The movie is a cartoon, though a mammothly enjoyable one.
99847|1|Baghead is at its best when it captures the subtleties of romantic machinations, macho power plays and the indignity of women aging in Hollywood.
19186|1|Director Billy Wilder's technique of photographing Third Avenue in the grey morning sunlight with a concealed camera to keep the crowds from being self-conscious gives this sequence the shock of reality.
86908|0|Unfortunately, the sound-bite journalism of filmmakers Lisa Lax and Nancy Stern glosses over the larger unanswered questions in the documentary.
68693|1|The funniest in the Pink Panther series
63505|1|There's not an excess of exposition, and the pricey CGI Hulk at his disposal is more angrily expressive than the mute one employed by Lee.
29351|1|I know how nearly every shot was done by this point, but that hasn't dimmed what is to me the essential magic of the movie.
58429|1|Schepisi doesn't have time to show off; Despite the opportunity for some beautiful widescreen vistas, he doesn't use them as a crutch or a cheap conduit for a scene transition without a proper segue. [Well, other than Busey's unbelievably toothy grin.]
2431|0|So simple, so broad are White Man's Burden's paint strokes ... that no real lesson outside of the obviously mundane can be elicited, and that's a real shame.
88399|1|It takes a while to adjust to this amiable film's languorous tempo but you might find it's worth the wait.
93382|1|Loaded with pop references and clips from old movies, it's like a bizarre comic precursor to 'The Dreamers'...
25635|0|A shapeless comedy of little merit.
28476|1|The film ends up being very nearly as good [as House of Usher], and better in some respects.
45141|1|Yet another mystifyingly lionized Sirkian soaper.
42289|0|Too dumb for anyone over 8 and too vulgar for anyone under 12.
14285|0|Enough is too much...even in 3-D. The franchise sinks.
98883|1|Not just if you're a horror fan but also if you enjoy a well fashioned, slimy yarn to get wrapped up in.
15151|1|A spirited cast, including old pros Amma Meara and younger talent Parker Posey and Stanley Tucci, elevates this claustrophobic sitcom (most of whiche is set in a car) into something fluffier and funnier than it actually is.
37107|0|"Idiotic ""comedy"" is larded with thick makeup and thin performances."
18287|0|Simplicity often leads to profundity, but A Taste of Cherry (especially the ending) represents lazy cinema that has been overrated by too many.
57139|1|Sexy, squalid.
88624|1|... like an impressionistic documentary of a man resigned to his loneliness.
71977|1|If you find meticulously staged, passionately sung anthems about love, beauty, truth, and joy to be tiresome, then don't drop a dime on this film. Otherwise GO!
29189|1|Caligula boasts a sort of notoriety known to few films. It was a lavish accident: the marriage of legitimate film and smut.
45235|1|The Misfits is about some modern day Reno denizens who have trouble fitting into society...
63598|1|Rough-hewn and vigorous, Karim Aïnouz's first feature film tells the story about an illiterate 1930s drag queen... and it's surprisingly good.
34242|1|More firm in its social implications than ever it was on the stage and blessed with a priceless performance by rocketing Judy Holliday, this beautifully integrated compound of character study and farce made a resounding entry at the Victoria yesterday.
82003|0|Too long...For them to allow their petulant disagreements to be so widely seen indicates that they are either amazingly mature and self-confident, or amazingly masochistic.
42415|0|Unfortunately, when he finds himself, apparently by convincing Trudy to come back to him, the film slides into sharp decline. In a screwball comedy, the man's turn -- to embrace girlish shenanigans and such -- is the end.
64797|1|A nineties schlock spectacular...
27056|1|A surprisingly good effort to extend the narrative of the first two films in a manner both intelligent and likely.
93160|0|A truly laughable movie, one that takes itself far too seriously without ever taking a moment to consider who its audience is -- or if it even has one.
100339|0|High concept thriller which fails to captivate due to unsympathetic characters.
48841|1|A lavish musical, too lavish for the subject matter, though.
40497|1|[Tornatore] eludes sentimentality with a romantic vision wide enough to embrace the range of human experience.
47672|1|Great filmmaking? No, but it's warmly enjoyable and a pleasant way to spend an evening.
47653|1|Maintains a fairly smooth course on the delicate line between tenderly funny comedy and affecting, involving drama.
25810|1|Keaton's first major role marked him for stardom; and also added to Howard's newly forming directorial stature.
82177|0|Like the similarly stylized Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow and, to a certain extent, 300, Casshern is more about visuals than story. It's a CG playground where cartoon and live action collide.
101511|1|Knightley shines in this tale of grace under pressure.
7904|1|Welcome back (I hope), Eddie Murphy.
83658|1|As unalloyed a look at who our people are in the Iraqi theatre of war and how they're conducting themselves as anything recorded.
4640|0|Decidedly average . . .
80017|1|Forget about the cosmic significance: it is the work of a talented film-maker, and full of memorable scenes.
91812|1|This is a powerful film that will horrify you and make you angry, if you dare to see it.
102235|1|A fun time-killer for kids aged tween and up...
100132|1|Alex and Anna's interactions are the enchanted heart - volleying between sequences of the two at play and ones that emphasize their loneliness and disconnection.
72030|1|Naive as its young heroine, but also as good-natured. [Blu-ray]
4031|1|One of Lee's more modest but admirable pieces.
94625|1|Meadows obviously knows the working class neighborhoods that he depicts. There's a grit and honesty to his film as he chronicles the mundane details of these kids' lives.
12431|1|Historical drama as well as vastly entertaining adventure.
50845|0|Dumas would feel insulted that the characters he breathed life into were no more than charicatures prancing across the screen in a period action film.
55181|0|About Amy's cuteness, Amy's career success (she's a best-selling writer of self-help books who can't help herself), and Amy's neuroses when it comes to men.
52362|1|The third in the popular Paramount series, starring Bob Hope, Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour, is considered by some to be the most entertaining.
16323|0|An extravaganza of bad special effects and worse acting
37869|1|Solid (if dated) college-years drama.
28555|1|Is it the best comedy ever made? I don't know, but it surely is the funniest.I stand by that. And don't call me Shirley.
62341|0|Kids will revolt, parents will snooze, and I will be downright giddy if I never encounter another Pokémon movie as long as I live.
15541|1|Pete Postlethwaite's best film this summer!
86115|1|A fine attempt, and fine entertainment, but not one for the ages.
39767|1|The desolate desert imagery combined with Jack Marshall's creepy score make for a sporadically transfixing experience.
25663|1|Exaggerated and generally silly, but most of the performances are worth watching, despite the material.
32064|0|What a sad and melancholy piece of work. ... Fiennes basically reprises his English Patient role as the heroic destroyer of covenants and promises.
50850|1|Kevin Reynolds's telling of the Alexandre Dumas classic delightfully evokes the halcyon days of screen swashbucklers.
2846|1|Unforgettable.
27343|1|Reflects that flavorful, outspoken, provocative, distinctly Cuban Latino-centricity, a weapon against the prolonged U.S. blockade.
89148|1|There's something truly illuminating in the telling of Daniel Johnston's story and his painful struggle with bipolar disorder.
7474|1|Supernatural fun with attitude.
56947|1|It shouldered its way into the popular consciousness, perhaps with a few concessions and a straining dramatic license, but nonetheless it remains a thoughtful, provocative engagement of legitimate issues relating to Judaism, the ancient, ever evolving rel
5651|1|A lot of fun! Branagh does excellent bringing Shakespeare's comedy to life.
82958|1|This gay coming-of-age film from Germany ultimately has few original aspects, but it is an intelligently wrought drama that makes it a respectable entry in the genre.
56638|1|Politics -- hardly a movie audience's immediate choice when it comes to entertainment -- becomes a deeply engaging subject in Blame It on Fidel thanks to a 9-year-old charmer who steals our hearts.
66576|0|It is extraordinary that, with gangster-era America providing such a natural source of drama, director Michael Karbelnikoff should turn gritty reality into such an empty tale.
100642|1|It's excessively and imaginatively gory, presented in a straightforward manner, but with the slightest hint of a wink.
97140|1|Frank Darabont presents a movie with one of the most pesimist and hopeless endings in cinema history. [Full review in Spanish]
76987|1|It's pure romantic fantasy, almost too cute and naively innocent for its own good.
99244|0|Ruiz is so intent on harnessing the painter to his own -- here, rather arid -- relativism that he never manages to convey the unfettered eros that brings crowds flocking to exhibitions of Klimt's work, even as critics hold their noses.
88797|0|Lordy mama, the thing's just unspeakable.
76752|1|The 5th Musketeer is old fashioned film fare.
85695|0|Ten years ago, The Chumscrubber might have seemed groundbreaking. Today, it's not just unoriginal but as dull and nondescript as a Barratt home.
84091|1|A light, pastoral fantasy with civil rights angles, underscored by comedy values.
76836|0|This is a movie where 'sensitivity' and 'sincerity' are signposted by songs by Paul Simon and Nick Drake, which I guess says it all.
49513|0|One of the Python's weakest.
30649|1|Director Terence Young never quite solves the pacing problems posed by filming underwater, but John Stears's Oscar-winning special effects more than compensate.
64283|1|the film's opening action sequence is the first of several that are likely to have you thumbing the backscan button because they look so damn cool (and are so damn fast).
38863|0|Evokes a period in time before Ritalin and common sense.
83468|0|While stylishly done, Parkhill's script isn't nearly as clever as he thinks it is, and the sucker punch near the end lacks, well, punch.
5010|1|It's a psycho-erotic thriller with more twists and shocks than the rattlesnake which, at one point, leaps out at star Bruce Willis-from a location we won't describe. (It would spoil one of the several dozen surprises.)
40755|1|Talk Radio has all the charm of a conversation with Morton Downey Jr. and Geraldo Rivera. It's fascinating without being likable. It's exploitative, mean-spirited and angry... and very compelling.
33526|1|An enormously entertaining movie.
96511|0|"There is no I in ""team,"" but there are three in ""idiotic."" And idiotic more or less describes the appeal of The Comebacks, a so-stupid-it's-funny spoof of inspirational sports dramas."
28736|0|There's a decent bit of escapism in here somewhere, but Emmerich doesn't possess the finesse to make the material rampage as it should.
95019|1|Freed from the constraints of the Grindhouse package, Death Proof can now spread out, find its proper rhythms, and emerge as another excellent Tarantino classic.
33258|1|Not a mere movie but a cinematic event.
21541|0|Os personagens são bem realizados e animados, mas o roteiro, além de plagiar O Senhor dos Anéis, é burocrático e pouco envolvente.
24299|1|It is a more than decent adaptation of the classic tale, one that, despite what I have said in the previous paragraph, never talks down to its audience.
11862|1|Brilliant documentary.
2377|0|This was just pathetic.
2553|1|Total chick-flick -- but quite a bit better than it looks.
58830|1|This multiple-murder story is an offbeat sort of film, with Robert Wagner portraying a calculating youth who intends to allow nothing to stand in his way to money... Gerd Oswald's restrained direction suits the mood.
98274|1|Alex Gibney won best documentary Oscar for this gruelling, angry movie.
37536|1|Gibson impressively fleshes out Max, Tina Turner is striking in her role as Aunty (as well as contributing two topnotch songs, which open and close the picture) and the juves are uniformly good.
81671|1|While the content isn't always pretty, the lessons are important. And, Brooks, thankfully, isn't afraid to face these themes, ugliness and all.
84130|1|Deeply affecting and visually mesmerizing, this is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen.
19123|1|The acting is strong, and Arthur Miller's Oscar-winning photography gives the images a spooky luster, but a little bit of Ford's salt-of-the-earth piety goes an awfully long way.
5624|1|It was made 33 years ago but Nagisa Oshima's doomed lust classic doesn't look in the least bit dusty. Quite the opposite.
3499|1|The tonal shifts in White display, for the first time, the emotional depth the trilogy enables, and functions secondly to paint expectations for Red.
56715|1|Take Care of My Cat offers a refreshingly different slice of Asian cinema.
10812|1|An amiable comedy full of chase, chase, fall-down, chase.
82938|1|A great opening and...a visceral, heartbreaking ending
56051|1|Moonlight Mile makes you realize how much Dustin Hoffman's presence on the big screen has been missed the past few years.
46362|1|This is filmmaking meant to engage the heart -- and other visceral organs -- more than the mind; its effects are simple, broad and directly put.
100692|1|The arc of the film follows the arc of Ozu's career, or really the arc of life itself.
41598|0|[The film is] directed by offbeat filmmaker Jim McBride, who gives the action a lot of energy but falls back too often on the usual sex-and-violence formulas.
94679|1|This sequel takes its predecessor's derivative, remorseless premise and deepens it a bit, though I can't be alone in wondering why this, of all things, should be a franchise.
45404|1|Doesn't so much charm as insinuate; like its female protagonist, it's under your skin before you know it.
96368|0|Wilson, Brody and Schwartzman are each fine, but if you found yourself stuck in a train compartment with their characters, you'd vamoose.
17676|1|The greatest pleasures come from the acting.
33810|1|Noir wasn't new in 1955, but The Big Combo still found plenty of life within its limits.
94338|0|Puccini for Beginners is littered with witty dialogue, although some of it is so obviously scripted that it can become off-putting.
29711|1|As adolescent adventures go, Risky Business is an invigorating, first-class affair: It manages to make coming of age a witty proposition.
93476|0|A convoluted and rather dull affair.
45767|0|There's little enough to keep you occupied as Caine and Martin go through their comic set pieces in workaday fashion while the film moves mechanically from one contrived situation to the next.
7599|0|Stay for Weird Al Yankovic's brilliant opening credits, then flee!
74522|1|Might be the best film of acclaimed comedian Harold Lloyd's silent film days.
79375|1|The narration is the only bad thing about an otherwise wonderful [film].
59359|1|Though Costa-Gavras brings nothing new to the table about the Holocaust, he puts another nail down in the argument that the world could have acted but didn't because of indifference.
48038|0|Huffs like a bus headed uphill while Mr. Sonnenfeld and company shovel on weirdness and hope for the best.
17400|0|Among those who will be insulted by this painfully unfunny comedy are women, the elderly and members of several ethnicities, as well as moviegoers with even the slightest modicum of taste.
79207|1|This Oscar-nominated, lavishly produced musical catapulted Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth to major stardom.
42489|0|"Hammy performances by Charlton Heston as John the Baptist, Telly Savalas as Pilate, and, in the most notorious bit of casting, John Wayne(!) as a Roman soldier overseeing the crucifixion (""Truly, this man was the son of God,"" drawls the Duke)."
5149|1|The best film of 1993. Seriously. Great breakthrough performance by Gwyneth Paltrow also.
44743|1|A film that's lovely to hear, though not much to look at.
5969|1|An underrated gem. Gary Oldman is amazing.
445|0|Enjoyable, but dry, adaptation of a Jane Austen romance.
27504|0|There's always room for fancy trash, and this movie -- about a gang of punk vampires terrorizing the new kids in town -- seems capable of providing some. Then the characters open their mouths.
72212|1|The face-off between Achilles and Hector is beautifully realized, all the more wounding because we can precisely read each man's emotions going into the fight.
71047|0|It is, despite the distractions, just a simple murder story, and the revelations in the end are hardly surprising or noteworthy.
91456|1|Land of Plenty has a few too many coincidences and tends to be sugary, but it has an important precautionary message in this age of terror.
15295|0|Despite some early indications from the two Cusacks and Arkin that it's going to be funny, it winds up an unholy mess that becomes steadily more incoherent -- morally, dramatically, and conceptually.
90270|1|Curtis Hall keeps slipping in surprising social and emotional flavorings rarely found in [this] genre.
43995|0|While the film manages to drag the actual attack out to 45 minutes of its ponderous 183 minute running time, that still leaves a lot of movie to be taken up by what passes for plot -- a convoluted romance of the heavily cliched kind.
63263|1|At its heart, On_Line is just an old-fashioned movie about people, relationships and making connections in an isolated world. And in this sense, the movie is very successful.
40267|1|This is one of Sandler's lesser films, but fans will dig it nonetheless. I did.
44333|0|Unfortunately, more often than not it settles for the bright Yuppie banter ... you would expect of this bunch of characters.
77589|1|One of the most groundbreaking films in recent memory in terms of both the explicitness of its sexuality and its commitment to such an austere intellectual discourse.
32255|0|A deeply racist movie, though clearly none of the filmmakers thinks so... By the picture's end, we are asked to grasp electrocution as in some way an act of benevolence.
37842|0|On some subterranean level, it's a study of how celebrity agents can coerce a talented veteran actor into participating in one of the most painfully unfunny comedies ever made.
56131|1|'Infinitamente superior a Hannibal. Brinda nuevamente la oportunidad de ver en pantalla a uno de los íconos de la cinematografía mundial.'
60222|1|It's impossible to imagine this movie not being presented in CinemaScope, as the widescreen format is integral in supporting the imaginative use of split-screen techniques.
88569|0|This harmless but charmless caper will have everybody except the most undemanding tot fidgeting.
1994|0|Cutting-edge ideas can't quite compensate for a banal storyline.
22794|1|Unsettling and-yes-often scorchingly funny!
87174|0|full review in Greek
53586|0|His characters, as is now his norm, are plastic puppets, even in the confectionary love scenes. Most of their dialogue is so doughy that it could be spooned into comic-strip balloons. Lucas simply has no interest in these people.
70392|1|There's nothing here that hasn't been seen or done before, but Luketic and his stars' unabashed sweetness and sincerity make for a winning confection.
99381|0|It doesn't take long for Bill to suddenly veer off course into total impenetrability, where the characters become a blur, the hacky visual poetry is rolled out, and the plot drops dead.
52560|1|So unique and stubborn and charismatic that you want it to be better and more successful than it is.
82723|1|As a showcase for Geoffrey Rush, though, Life and Death is more than worthwhile.
9188|0|Mr. McCarey's direction is unpropitiously and unaccountably slow.
17962|1|The actors are always fun to watch, and that's what saves this movie from being utter crap.
77926|0|...very predictable...
79628|0|The respectable but boring film is nevertheless worth watching for the robust performances of Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole
97537|0|At a short 93 minutes, it feels as though Charlie Wilson's War was hacked up in the editing room, leaving the bare bones of the structure but little of the really juicy meat.
9139|1|Foreign Correspondent works best for what it was designed for: Propaganda.
68542|1|Guilty pleasure: One of Warner's best acted melodramas and Bette Davis's all-time favorite, in which she lives hard but dies in dignity as an heiress gone blind. Also Davis revenge as Tallulah Bankhead failed to bring the role to life in the 1934 play.
45814|1|A well made rarity, a glimpse at what happens to American heroes after the applause has died away.
12406|1|While its consonance comes largely from Gordon Willis's photography and Allen's spacious sense of New York, pathos comes at best from Keaton's evaporative performance and a slightly sentimental conception.
24733|1|...so gorgeous it feels as if it's being seen through heavenly eyes - at least until fresh hell rips across the screen.
34862|0|Sure, the movie opens up the racial problems of everyday life in New York, but it also has a very forgiving tone to what one could label as the oppressed.
59706|1|The standard 'quest' material that most fantasy is made of, but in this case heroics and spectacle are secondary to drama
17561|1|Underwater slimies eat everyone. A sly sense of humor helps immeasurably.
32321|1|A good picture in the class division, for shivers and smiles.
26080|1|Sometimes in tragedies healing can only take place when love means letting go.
43910|1|The first Oscar for Best Animated Feature went to Shrek, an absurd choice to those of us who believe that Pixar's Monsters, Inc. was that year's best toon flick. Still, this is nevertheless a snappy comedy that manages to stick it to the entire genre.
90636|1|You know what? There are few better antidotes to intense Oscar-wanna-be releases and treacly holiday throwaways than a fun, high-concept starring 3-4 generations of comedians. Yeah, I said it.
984|1|Simple yet appealing movie from Iran's burgeoning film industry.
27075|0|The thought that he may yet return for further adventures with his body and Lugosi's sconce fills us with mortal terror. That is the most fearful prospect which the picture manages to convey.
2689|1|Dumb and Dumber, which features Carrey and Jeff Daniels as nitwits traveling cross-country, is a frayed string of gags posing as a movie. Carrey, though, does literal-minded doofdom with peerless enthusiasm.
17665|0|I found the film interesting and somewhat engrossing, but the characters weren't developed enough to make it a better than average film.
34448|1|It may also be the best American movie, or at least the most American movie ....
46511|1|Reveals the difficulties many Vietnam veterans have in readjusting to life at home.
45692|1|It's as entertaining as it gets.
37145|1|... the story is a strange mix of supernatural weirdness, demonic invasion and rotting corpses hunting down the living with a sense of purpose.
5398|1|Miscarried justice often provides the vehicle for emotionally wrenching drama and histrionic fireworks, and such is the case in spades with In the Name of the Father.
19803|0|The plot twists may offer something different from the series, actually having a little more in common with the first film than any other. However, this wasn't that original.
42331|1|What's unusual is the almost achingly beautiful photography by Breno Silveira.
9274|1|Love in the Afternoon had great locations going for it. It also had the winsome charm of Hepburn, the elfin puckishness of Chevalier, a literate script by Wilder and Diamond, and an airy feeling that wafted the audience along.
47590|0|This is the WB version of a baseball movie. Everyone is young, toned, sexually active and agonizes over their future.
24711|1|he General is the highlight of his career's tragicomic performances, featuring not just the awe-inspiring stunts that were his bread and butter, but also a level of fluidity only he and Chaplin attained at the top of their games.
63467|1|A unique subject, though it's presented a little unevenly. Firth is a real charmer.
21190|1|While The Jerk is an extremely episodic little movie, that's a malady easily forgiven -- simply because the episodes are so damn funny.
39078|0|Raunchy, dated send-up of cop movies has lots of sex.
70795|0|One of those extremely long and well-meaning adaptations of plays, this doesn't really amount to very much, despite its intrinsically moving subject matter.
76278|1|Richly entertaining adaptation of the popular Cervantes-inspired musical.
43162|0|Several scenes in this movie progress at a snail's pace.
87829|1|Like Catherine Hardwicke's Thirteen, only with money, this is an engaging and frequently tense teen drama with a full-on performance from Anne Hathaway.
83947|0|With the fun, nonstop momentum of a Saturday morning cartoon, D.E.B.S. makes you forgive most of its shortcomings.
75350|1|"Raoul Walsh's Freudian film is one of the fastest and toughest crime-gangster films ever made, boasting a bravura performance from James Cagney as a misogynist mama boy (""top of the world, Ma"")."
75997|0|Somewhere along the way [Story] apparently forgot he was making a comedy. But, then again, the script doesn't exactly provide an arsenal of creativity.
74352|1|Serious as a heart attack and so emotionally wrenching that it's almost difficult to watch.
39400|0|This film is all flash and little or no substance.
83578|0|What ruins this revenge flick is Madea's boorish, bull in the china store act reminiscent of the sassy black woman stereotype popularized by Sanford and Son's Aunt Esther. Loud and ignorant, Medea tends to trivialize every scene.
93313|1|It's a remarkable immersion in a world turned morally inside out.
48534|1|A multilayered documentary that explores music and friendship, and in its own quiet way, the battle with fame.
59105|0|A great deal of screen time is devoted to the false intellectualism and forced mannerisms of dinner party conversations.
94526|0|Despite director Mike White's ability to make the heartfelt moments count, the film never makes the grade. The title prompts great expectations for animal lovers; the result is a bit like a doggie bag with a taste of everything, but not enough of anything
61500|0|Cheesy, vapid, contrived, and shallow...
23414|1|Benigni does with the Nazi setting what Chaplin didn't dare in The Great Dictator--he lets the liberating nonsense triumph.
102583|1|The drama may be clunky and old-fashioned, but once Melodrama gets rolling, it never stops engaging the viewer.
75461|1|Road movie about the spiritual transformation of an uptight and unhappy individual.
30577|1|Shambling yet delicate, Demme's screwball tall tale gazes at TV contests and novelty ballads and sees not derisive kitsch but the warm connective tissue of human yearning
67413|1|A stunning technical achievement.
51432|1|A gaudy soap opera that also manages to satirise gaudy soap operas. Hows about that?
85986|0|A computer-animated movie from Disney about the contributions of carrier pigeons in World War II. Good topic, fair animation, but the story quacks like a duck.
16754|1|I groaned my way through this black -- and blue -- romantic comedy and then decided I liked it.
49006|1|There is an interesting story here, but the movie circles it at a distance.
80105|1|La.rgely successful with some gaping flaws, and deeply experimental in a way that verges on upsetting
95659|0|Capitalizing on the successes of both March of the Penguins and An Inconvenient Truth, the sappy Artic Tale is more akin to a commercial for a McDonald's Happy Meal.
54786|0|Joseph Losey didn't really do frivolous. Which is probably why his attempt at spoofy pseudo-Bondery is so direly unfunny.
12229|1|Watching Psycho today we are all, like Marion in the shower, vainly trying to recover lost innocence too late.

98077|0|By mid way, you wish the jumper were you. Teleporting yourself to the outer lobby would be far enough.
20919|0|...manages some acrobatic dance numbers, but they seem oddly confined by the camera's frame.
15365|1|A fascinating film.
86480|0|McKean's inexperience as a director trips the film. There is so much going on that the viewer can't take in all the imagery, and McKean's devotion to his skewed vision slows the story to a crawl.
78576|1|It's an irresistible enigma of a film
18499|0|What begins as a promising, potentially brilliant political satire fast degenerates into yet another celebrity soapbox...
12933|1|The idea of sacrifice permeates everything, along with the cruelty and horror. This is Cimino's masterpiece.
102360|1|As a movie, very little actually happens. It's a lot of discussion about what might have happened or may occur in future, and then the emotional change that signals the curtain to drop and for the class to put down their pencils. The performances are st
26218|1|Relationships are always leaps of faith requiring only a courageous heart and a commitment to the beloved that goes beyond either rhyme or reason.
14791|0|Benny & Joon tries to get by on quirkiness alone, and, while something this offbeat frequently carries a unique kind of appeal, it needs stronger characters than Sam and Joon.
12979|1|The movie is expertly calculated to derive maximum comic energy from Bill Murray's great, deadpan mug and his drop-dead I'm-not-impressed line readings.
34790|1|Entertaining, with a vintage Pacino performance that only occasionally lapses into grandstanding.
34317|1|Breaking Away embraces the good old fashioned small town family values that would catapult Ronald Reagan to an enormously popular two term presidency. And still, I like it.
77958|0|[A] cloying road/buddy flick.
37790|1|Excellent cast, headed by newcomer Richard Roundtree, may shock some audiences with heavy dose of candid dialog and situation.
41420|1|If only for Grier's performance, Coffy is a must see.
33894|1|Some hard-core science-fiction fans might nit-pick over details in Pitch Black, but for the average moviegoer looking to be entertained, this roller-coaster of a film should not be missed.
72178|0|Treads a well-traveled road and needs more than a chicken to be distinctive -- it needs a sense of transcendence, a reason to endure its sadness.
82897|1|Minor but delightful Sturges comedy.
95043|1|"At first glance, ""Rescue Dawn"" might seem like Herzog gone Hollywood, but it's still very much the man's work. Herzog has his cake and eats it too."
5118|0|Mostly lame and not particularly funny.
19910|0|The shocks are infinitesimal, the script diabolical.
102304|1|Unlike so many documentaries that exploit stereotypes of Southern ignorance, the people of Bishopville come off as intelligent and articulate, with an acute awareness of their shortcomings in the evolution toward more equitable race relations.
65914|1|Luther is the textbook radical: he acts out what his contemporaries merely profess.
14332|0|Only moderately amusing.
98343|0|The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for even allowing this movie to enter a movie theatre. It was like a bad made for TV special that you would see on ABC or NBC.
79911|1|Will remind you just how much movies from the 1970s differ from the ones making their way to the megaplexes nowadays . . .
35458|1|It's a likable-enough adventure that feels much smaller than the widescreen landscapes in which it takes place.
68124|1|The Wedding Banquet does take some of the same delight in constructing a comedy of misunderstandings and deceptions. But the movie also has a warm heart, and by the end somehow manages to become very moving.
21713|0|Aside from Corrigan, there is nothing that I can recommend about it.
85803|0|Raid may move, but it isn't particularly moving.
41089|1|Like the good magician, Mamet plays some tricks on us which cause bristles of amazement.
27987|1|One of the last truly great Roman epics.
25007|1|It delivers the goods in a fresh manner.
7506|1|The movie's best asset is the old-fashioned, buddy-movie interplay between Cage and Connery - Cage as the frantic, white-collar lab technician who doesn't like guns, Connery as the weathered, resourceful old pro.
39195|1|I'm happy to report that while it's deeply flawed, it's not by any means a bad film.
12742|1|The Bridge on the River Kwai amused and excited me.
71402|1|One of the most insightfully sad explorations of the human drive for love since Annie Hall concluded that we need the eggs.
44579|0|Let's face it, people going to see this movie expect two things: Lots of action and lots of slo-mo shots of Jolie running.
5831|1|Brilliant. Campion's use of interior and exterior space is amazing.
13285|1|Generates claustrophobic suspense by focusing on three images: Kane's increasingly tense, pained expression; implacably ticking clocks; and the ominous, empty train tracks.
44787|1|A fun gangster film, telling the tale of you-can-never-really-leave that The Godfather, among others, championed so well.
35358|1|Obviously [Spielberg] had a ball with Close Encounters, and his pleasure in tinkertoying it together makes it enjoyable, mildly funny and -- in one sequence -- even credible.
31981|0|The plot is such hooey...and the plot holes so gaping that End of Days proves more exasperating than enjoyable. [Blu-Ray]
50541|1|A 17th century French costume drama where everybody is Kung-fu fighting - with some highly watchable results!
42435|1|A nostalgic throwback to the genteel British murder mystery pix of the 1950s.
38447|0|This pompous and dispassionate piece of vampire business leaves you longing for the ominous mists of Transylvania and midnight.
89117|1|A feel-good story using music and dance to guide problem kids onto the straight and narrow.....entertaining, although not the showstopper we might hope for
39864|0|Get Carter ultimately lacks the courage of its convictions: it can't stand to be thought of as the pulp it so clearly is.
118|1|Leave it to Billy Wilder to try to capture Roman Holiday's lightning in a bottle with Sabrina
99448|1|Reprise alternately shows punk energy, library hush and comic anxiety. And despite ominous portents, the ending is cockeyed optimistic.
82739|1|There is plenty to admire from a technical and artistic standpoint.
89070|1|A beautifully mounted movie that's difficult to shake.
81502|0|Cast and production values are serviceable but bland and there are some hiccoughs in the story, making this intriguing film perhaps best suited for a viewing on DVD at home.
38954|0|In a movie that bets the farm on delicate balancing, An Affair of Love comes close but doesn't quite strike the needed equilibriums.
28747|1|Perhaps Van Damme and Lundgren trade blows more easily than lines, but the whole affair is enjoyable in a mindless way.
57606|1|A fascinating glimpse into an insular world that gives the lie to many clichés and showcases a group of dedicated artists.
33044|1|Despite overkill in the ideas department, which many will find too pretentious for comfort or coherence, visually, Zed is a masterpiece.
32976|1|Really good animated movie. Full of action, excitement and character.
13433|0|The movie gets stuck as a run-of-the-mill teen revenge comedy.
82678|1|Drags its all-star cast through soap-opera melodramatics of a very high order.
97162|1|Family holiday dramedy has some iffy content.
55410|0|Bradford spends the entire film with an Andrew Shue-ish sullen, slack-jawed expression, but even that's more than what the bland Appleby brings to her doormat role.
90904|1|An elegantly acted psychological puzzle, it's like watching a nervous breakdown from the inside out.
79894|1|To his credit, Penn refused to romanticize his subjects, and the film stands as a fairly accurate chronicle of the times.
10321|1|"Much more than just a touching story of the ties that bind humanity and the way we reveal ourselves, ""Secrets and Lies"" (1996) is a staggering work of cinematic genius. It is truly a perfect film."
51425|1|Another movie that pretty much wastes Sellers.
96894|1|Before the Devil Knows You're Dead won't do much for anyone's feelings about human nature, but it will definitely restore your faith in gritty crime movies.
56891|1|Original for sure story of Travolta's movie sound effects guy recording a real murder.
93892|1|"""Dead Silence"" is not going to reinvent the genre. It's actually a big pile of nonsense, but that doesn't stop it from being fun nonetheless."
94792|0|The movie treats Gracie as a cause rather than an impassioned athlete.
25201|0|An A-list cast wallowing in grade-Z material
76588|1|An ensemble effort that recalls other great POW movies, Wars boasts many superb performances.
22092|0|Qualifies as one of the more entertaining bad movies of the year.
68276|1|Unsuccessful, but very striking.
76793|0|Here the problem is compounded by the fact that few members of the target audience (kids) are even aware of the original series.
71794|1|"Goofy ""great race"" fun."
27442|1|Smooth-flowing direction, a shrewdly pruned script and a top-flight ensemble cast that visibly relishes both the dialogue and one another's perfs make this a tony item for upscale, mature audiences.
55639|1|A terrific mystery thriller that's both suspenseful and human. Segal is especially winning.
52486|1|Joan Crawford in a shlocky classic B thriller and all about axe murders.

40493|0|...ravishing to look at...the lush cinematography and luxuriant musical score adding to our enjoyment. But, ultimately, the film disappoints by not being about very much.
52201|1|This is a charmer full of laughs...
20850|1|Blue Velvet is a film for the aficionado. Pity the viewer who wanders into the movie unprepared.
6868|1|Sparky playing, a generally sharp script and bright packaging add up to a neat little winner in the romantic comedy Jack & Sarah, a kind of After Nine Months London style.
78307|1|An absorbing and eerie study of paranoia and psychological torment.
24963|0|It's OK. It should not be fiscally encouraged, however. It's the greatest sin of Hollywood - competent but forgettable filmmaking.
15915|1|In the early '70s, people made movies like Cop Land all the time; Stallone is a reason they don't make them so often anymore. Maybethis is his way of making it up to us.
56504|1|Digital-video documentary about stand-up comedians is a great glimpse into a very different world.
44641|0|It turns out that Kubrick was right. The problems this story presented couldn't be solved after all.
41903|0|If nothing else, we can probably thank Lundgren for ensuring that there will be no more Rambo movies in the near future because he has obviously depleted the world supply of body grease.
92193|1|This film is probably not going to change anyone's view about this particular word, but it is an interesting, informative, and often entertaining take on the subject.
40307|0|It does not have the right stuff. Indeed, it is pretty silly stuff.
100239|1|Ellen Burstyn deserves another Oscar nomination for this compelling drama.
30613|1|Dalton revives the cool, ironic detachment of the Connery years, but he also allows a touch of obsession to show through Bond`s surface aplomb.
20625|0|Though children may be satisfied (if the witch stuff doesn't scare them) adults will have a harder time with the by-the-numbers confrontations between the witches and the plucky youths.
14160|1|"If most movies today are doomed to be sure-fire, presold properties--with ideas leached from our recent TV or cinematic past--let's hope they're all as good at the game as ""Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home."""
2597|1|I don't care if the flick cost $14.54 to produce; it's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.
3666|0|One of those chew-the-popcorn, munch-the-candy flicks - - the kind you go into expecting to have a good time, but nothing more. Given those expectations, disappointment is as unlikely as boredom.
88281|1|A breezy, passably funny spin on a children's classic, mixing slapstick and farce with character humour and delighting in demolishing stereotypes.
38051|1|...between a wasted world of heartland junkies and the dazed, private induced euphoria of one hopeful loser among them.
27351|1|Wenders is clearly an outsider-looking-in.
66086|1|a simple film of great feeling and generosity
62456|0|Headed in only one direction: straight into the toilet.
78458|0|The schmaltz content gets higher and higher, as if administered through a drip feed, until by the end we are drowning in sucrose.
81675|1|Vega radiates effortless strength and charm in her first Hollywood role, and Sandler proves to be a gratifyingly unpredictable leading man, self-effacing one moment and hilariously emphatic the other.
70407|1|It's certainly a far better thriller than anything Hollywood has churned out lately.
2325|1|Director Kathryn Bigelow comes closer than any other filmmaker to turning movies into a virtual reality trip.
8129|0|I did laugh a little.
63927|0|A nonsensical vanity project for singer Bob Dylan that wastes the talents of a lot of folks who should have known better.

72866|1|The Four Musketeers is far more subversive and contains more pointed social satire than its predecessor.
42836|0|If the movie were a farcical free-for-all ridiculing the hyper-competitive world of college football, it might be amusing. But it can never decide whether to be an athletic answer to National Lampoon's Animal House or icky-inspirational like Rocky.
57335|0|Not bad enough to qualify as a memorable dud, multinational production nonetheless misses mark on every level.
85824|0|A lack of real satirical bite is incongruously accompanied by a smug sense of self-importance in this shrill but toothless movie.
42227|0|This is a terrible, horrible film, a big-budget student film with stupidity and insipidity written all over it. AOL Keyword: Suck.
76723|1|Firmly establishes the brilliant filmmaker as invaluable an educator as he is a director.
78068|1|A film about the joy of being young and a little bit crazy, ruled by the organizing principle of all Zemeckis and Gale's early work: barely controlled chaos.
40200|1|It's refreshing to see a kids' film taking on such sinister subject matter.
96126|1|Powerful, downbeat drama with an anti-war message.

76909|1|How does director Michael Mann capture urban twilight so well?
10698|1|Good early Allen just before he became great.

28136|1|Brilliant, disturbing storytelling by Spielberg with standout performances.
5263|0|It's all a bit smug and suspect.
60929|1|If you're in synch with its heartbeat, and with Reygadas' tendency to pursue visual detours that intensify the film's sensual impact, this is a remarkable first effort that is equal parts disturbing, bold, mysterious and primal.
97114|0|Though well-intentioned, Braun's documentary never captures the emotional heart of this enormous tragedy and fails to ignite the passion he so obviously wants us to feel.
25669|0|There's no faulting Cage's committed, intense performance, but his slide from professional, internalised concern into personal, self-righteous rage still leaves a nasty aftertaste.
83220|1|Mr. Lou synthesizes a wide range of styles and influences -- from Casablanca to Wong Kar-wai -- resulting in a movie that, for all its haunting strangeness, seems curiously familiar.
90696|0|Daniels know his way around making the viewer uncomfortable, but there's a fine line between genuine, pants-tickling eroticism and 'I can't believe I'm watching this surrounded by strangers' soft-core porn.

65471|1|Every Cold War adolescent's fantasy: Linda Fiorentino possibly trying to kill you
71359|1|Unlike television cartoons that sell their souls to make the leap to the big screen, this animated G-rated film is faithful to Norman Bridwell's beloved book series about the big red dog.
7336|1|Galaxy Quest works not just as a parody or a send-up of a type of film. It works as a basic space adventure as well.
17123|1|In this nasty, verbose comedy, Woody Allen the director has cast Woody Allen the actor as a foul-mouthed, self-absorbed, sex-obsessed writer.
91668|0|Even if Watts makes it almost watchable, the ugly cinematography is too much of an eye strain to endure for such a thin and uninteresting story.
88102|0|A dark comedy that isn't dark or particularly funny, Keeping Mum ends up being an exercise in heavy-handed whimsy.
48533|1|A movie I found myself liking more than perhaps I should.

79858|1|One of the best movies about relationships ever. Outstanding performances.
35700|1|For a sports flick, this is unique and holds your attention for the most part.
30624|0|The Bond women are pallid mannequins, and so is the misused Dalton -- a moving target in a Savile Row suit. For every plausible reason, he looks as bored in his second Bond film as Sean Connery did in his sixth.
11149|1|The Funeral is yet another fresh take on the gangster flick.
33720|0|The fact is that although I admired specific things about the film, I never laughed very much and only felt slight, distant tremors of the joy that, I assume, rocked everyone connected with the movie during its production.

81087|1|"It's Japanese provocateur Takashi Miike's best film - a mordant spin on ""Little Red Riding Hood"" with sexist expectations as the wolf on which the tables are turned. Its ""kiri, kiri"" refrain also is the Zeroes' answer to ""Is it safe?"" from ""Marathon Man."""

75984|0|It's got suped up autos, suped up models, and suped up action. Fairly safe to say that it'll appeal to it's target audience, wethinks?
32679|1|As Errol Morris shows us how this strange little man got into the execution business and Holocaust denial, we should ask ourselves: Did we create 'Mr. Death'? Is he us?
80251|1|Truffaut is so precise with his observations and unintrusive with the camera that we feel as if we are seeing a documentary instead of contrived movie scenarios.

88173|1|There are plenty of impressive gunfights and some wicked martial arts sequences here, but the film is most likely to be remembered for its emphasis on free running, a dizzying physical technique in which the cast sprint, leap and roll through the city.

27071|1|While it doesn't stand up to its predecessors, The Ghost of Frankenstein boasts an enjoyable cast and good production values.

60763|0|Let us say the spirit is hinted but the projection of it is weak.
17795|0|This movie assembles all the indie-film-of-the-Nineties cliches: brainless criminals, a bad plan, lots of dialogue, and Christopher Walken.
52604|1|Cantet perfectly captures the hotel lobbies, two-lane highways, and roadside cafes that permeate Vincent's days
43237|1|It's not likely to be remembered come Oscar time...but if you find yourself laughing at your own flatulence from time to time, you might find some solid giggles.
14841|1|With his big sad eyes, Andrej Chalimon pulls us lovingly and completely into Kolya's life. He's simply perfect as a little Russian refugee in this poignant movie treasure.
22675|0|Blame It on Rio is not simply humorless. It also spreads gloom.
51280|1|Arguably the subtlest giallo ever made, it's a film to heighten the senses.
33499|0|It proves that a catchy title does not necessarily make for a good movie.
9411|1|Director Gregory La Cava was a master of the sustained comedy.
5821|1|The fable's surreal imagery and attention to detail, capturing a place and time--New Zealand outpost in 19th century--in which one mute person (the brilliant Holly Hunter) finds the true meaning of womanhood against all odds, linger in memory.
5384|1|Daniel Day-Lewis is remarkable.
20218|1|The best entry in the trilogy. [Full review in Spanish]

95383|0|Brutally disappointing.
91045|0|Throughout this fifth-grade Fear Factor, there are scattered lessons on the ills of bullying, the benefit of being true to yourself, the joy of true friendship. But really, what boy is going to remember a moral when there's an exploding worm?
67220|1|Soapy and trashy, and more than a little bit ludicrous. But there's quite a bit of subtext if you need it.
79946|1|"Sort of a sequel to De Palma's Greetings: De Niro plays a Vietnam vet who attempts to pursue a ""Peeping Tom"" art career with a new kind of porn film."
91648|0|Feels like experimental filmmaking and never seems to transcend that to something more profound or awe-inspiring.
2912|0|This exercise in entertainment futility features silly improbabilities, cheesy coincidences, and enough dunderheaded plot points to have made a terrific comedy.
41812|1|While the sci-fi is pretty hard to fault for what it is, and the adventure is aces for a high-concept 1980s family movie, the comedy is awfully wan and reedy.
44072|1|It's a sometimes self-indulgent, confused, ambitious movie that is often very funny and always fascinating.
17696|1|Complementing Walken's bravura turn are equally flamboyant performances by David Caruso as the young Irish cop out to destroy Walken, and Larry Fishburne as Walken's slightly crazy aide-de-camp.
56985|0|The pacing is lethargic and the action scenes uncomfortably stapled into the movie.
38072|0|A filmmaker out of touch with his own neuroses, making a final bid for recognition by exacerbating lives beyond his reach.
66730|0|The barbecue sandwich I had for lunch was infinitely more memorable than the movie that preceded it.
64478|0|Does Costner think that none of us have ever seen a Western before?The film does have one hell of a good shootout at the end, But Lord, does he make you wait for it.
59080|1|Creepiest movie of the year in every sense, and one of the best.
99629|1|Giving his film real emotional kick are the personal stories of Mad Dog and Stinky, two average guys chasing a media-fed dream that will only result in disappointment.
91501|1|Director Alexander Korda is the chief beneficiary of Laughton's larger-than-life performance, as his conservative helmsmanship fails to provide the film with a distinctly personal stamp
9476|1|An excellent combination of comedy and excitement.
37042|1|The series' spectacular photography, gimmickry, verve and wry wit are still abundant.
50611|0|It'd take a considerably more charming pair of leads to salvage a concept this lame and a screenplay this witless.
99744|1|In this delicate and understated portrait of selective reminiscence by Shopgirl director Anand Tucker, the now-grown son, played by Colin Firth, returns to the scene of the crime that was his childhood.
14860|1|A hard-edged, darkly funny satire about two Detroit junkies who discover if they want to go straight, they'll have to climb a Mt. Everest of forms, paperwork, office referrals, waiting rooms, rules and regulations.
71593|1|Assorted movie in-jokes should keep parents tolerably entertained, and Alan Menken's songs mercifully favor western swing over the expected twang pop.
62529|0|Its engines-without-attitude approach isn't just boring, it establishes Singleton as the anti-Walter Hill.
30365|1|Ex-Python Gilliam is one of the great conjurers of cinema, and this film is proof of his ample and unpredictable talent.
21346|1|The real magic is found in Andrew Dunn's stunningly lovely photography, which makes every scene look like a vintage storybook illustration.
72200|1|Breakin' transcends cliches thanks to Jamie Foxx's irreverence and charm
90684|0|Despite assembling a talented cast and crew, Daniels is stymied here by a script that takes itself far too seriously.
2112|0|Lord of Illusions is also quite repulsive, as it mixes the '40s-style film noir detective genre with ritual killings and supernatural demons.
36197|1|Conceivably the best picture Sam Goldwyn ever produced.
38845|0|Air America never finds a righteous pace -- it's an expensive ghost town mood with two handsome leads spending their screentime mentally cashing their paychecks.
55054|1|Art-house to the core, Read My Lips is a genre-curling crime story that revives the free-wheeling noir spirit of old French cinema.
12255|1|An inspired combination of wild comedy, a demented car chase, a double act that dovetails beautifully and terrific music, The Blues Brothers comfortably survives the test of time.
40566|1|It's abundantly clear that Lee, in conjunction with fight choreographer Yuen Wo-Ping (famed for The Matrix), has brought to these standard tropes his own elevating, near-feline sensibilities.
440|1|As gloriously romantic as it is giddily hilarious, Persuasion gives you a ruefully knowing smile as it sides with the wise heart. You leave the theater feeling better about everything.
100298|0|It's all a touch undercooked and dull.
28448|0|One of the least subtle motion pictures this year.
72667|1|Flamenco music takes heartbreak and transforms it into healing music. Vengo takes lamentation and shows how it can be transformed into the beauty of sacrificial love.
80928|1|If you don't feel the bones breaking, you're not watching closely enough.
95285|1|Brock creates a sensitive, personal tale of an underdog coming into his own.
42575|1|Googalee moogalee Vincent Price.
19434|1|This is really Sly's movie as he slugs his way through a heartfelt performance and delivers some cracking punches, both literally and emotionally.
70121|1|This thriller is not quite up to the best Hitchcock, but it does prove that Delmer Daves is a man to watch. And The Dark Passage is a picture to see.
9231|1|"Not much more than a fluffy little valentine of a movie, but there's still some actual warmth and wit underneath the ""been there, seen that, nice wedding"" exterior."
56867|1|Well-meaning liberal message story.
71439|0|There's a certain type of detective you only find in the movies. The sort who solves murders by lying in a victim's grave.
33486|0|Unfocused stuff, pitched at undemanding teenagers.
21667|0|"""another sequel nobody needed to make"""
69466|1|A terrifically realised film, startlingly emotional and wonderfully visceral.
40134|0|El resultado final pudo haber sido mucho mejor, de no ser por el meloso final con todo y mensaje moralista de que cada persona debe de estar contenta con quien es en realidad
7780|0|The film's real irony is that Gwen and Nick are so annoying that they deserve each other.
17872|0|Amazing that with a talented cast, the movie (plot: Single father.) just sits there like a stuffed monkey.
97291|1|While sure to secretly entertain the child in all us adults, here's a flick absolutely guaranteed to entrance the under-10s.
63999|1|Lucía reveals a great deal about herself in 110 minutes of self-fulfilling narration, but imagine how much better the experience would have been had the story allowed itself to match that depth.
38938|0|While far from terrible, The Tic Code ultimately lacks the sophistication that separates a feature-length film from a TV movie-of-the-week.
60331|1|Normalmente, não aprecio o tipo de humor rasteiro que este tipo de produção costuma empregar, mas exceções acontecem, e os risos provocados por este filme são a prova disto.
68613|1|It never less than dazzling to look at.
76697|1|Robert Wise's virtuosically squalid microcosm
79872|0|Regardless of a distinct lack of romantic chemistry between Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo, the able-bodied actors fulfill the slapstick demands of this run-of-the-mill family comedy based on the 1968 movie with Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball.
52054|1|It is a bloated Western that contains some extraordinary moments, a lot of heavy-handed political commentary and a hell of a lot of padding.
22199|0|Ultimately, all this dross just adds up to a film that's plain dull.
43933|0|Nothing runs very deep, or very diverting ... in this overplayed, underwritten slice of (love-)life.
556|0|With their perilously wide, Walter Keane eyes, the Olsen twins are cute enough, but compared with other child performers their charms seem forced.
36306|0|... more like a Star Trek television episode
75887|0|A hilariously bad movie that has to be seen to be believed.
88452|1|It's a pleasure to watch James Franco and Tyrese Gibson square off against each other as two men heading for a showdown.
29266|1|Dated yes, but still joy to see Redford and Fonda early in careers.
61112|0|Should be a sci-fi screenwriter's dream; but this dream is more like one that Michael Crichton would have than Jules Verne, and there's not a breath of imagination on display
57814|1|This is a winning ensemble comedy that shows Canadians can put gentle laughs and equally gentle sentiments on the button, just as easily as their counterparts anywhere else in the world.
84393|1|Slicker, funnier and more professional than its predecessor.
15514|1|Terrence McNally's Tony award-winning play, a perceptive, often hilarious look and love and life in the AIDS era, is so sharply written and bluntly entertaining that it almost overcomes Joe Mantell's static direction, which is too theatrical.
29000|1|...an above-average neo-noir...
72400|1|The effect of 28 Up is to bring a dimension of wisdom and insight to the earlier footage, and in doing this Mr. Apted has been subtle and selective.
76770|0|The pacing is slack, the big mystery not mysterious enough, and the showdowns between Holmes and Moriarty a bit too silly for my taste.
55872|0|This is a style of camp so broad that even the most bovine straight can get it.
16495|1|Before you know it, you're caught up in a difficult but touching friendship, and enjoying a history lesson more than you ever thought possible.
20645|0|Another forced and charmless sequel spawned from a surprisingly fun flick.

75728|0|An animated film without a hint of anima.
73367|1|Between Halperin's White Zombie and Mizoguchi's Ugetsu lies Jacques Tourneur's masterpiece
95819|1|Lovely performances all round create small-town competitiveness, frustrations and aspirations.
66145|1|What's fresh about Boyz N The Hood is the contemporary L.A. setting, presented with care and energy by young writer/director Singleton.
41055|1|O Brother, Where Art Thou? is the Being John Malkovich of the year 2000. The most remarkable thing about it is just how any sane studio executive agreed to back it.
64771|1|The Keep is a worthy successor to a mode of horror, as morally unsettling as it is spiritually devastating, that threads through films like Murnau's Nosferatu and Lewton and Robson's Isle of the Dead.
81418|1|a deeply intriguing and contemplative two-person character study that offers many small rewards along the way
28248|0|Plenty emerges as an absorbing and fastidiously made adaptation of David Hare's acclaimed play, but also comes off as cold and ultimately unaffecting.
4559|1|An awful movie but a tremendous spectacle and a pinnacle of camp exuberance, NOT to be missed.
76928|1|May be one of the most perfect cyberpunk films ever made.
21924|1|It's a movie that's haunted by death, with lengthy sequences played out in cemeteries.
87102|0|Dig that freaky symbolism!
100271|1|With its mournful score, muted cinematography and restrained performances, this is a work of sober commemoration, though the climactic depiction of the mass killing is justifiably harrowing.
35453|1|This is a sincere, well-acted movie about the short life of a minor rock 'n' roll star, and by the time it's over we almost have the feeling Valens would have been surprised not to have died in a crash.
38784|0|Later Karloff features him in name only
82992|1|Older teens may enjoy; too creepy for kids.
90174|0|A miserable disappointment.
87268|0|50 Cent dies for our sins in disappointing screen debut.
41329|0|Ooooh! Beware the sesame seeds!
2229|1|Not only a damn good thriller, but a terrifying account of how easily such technology can malfunction.
34810|1|Obscene, absurd and hilarious, Animal House is a genre classic.
21796|1|Discovering that his father's opinion of him is as low as his opinion of himself, Vaughn conveys his dismay and a new self-awareness with a furrow of his brow and a kind of panic in his eyes, an economy of physicality that nevertheless speaks volumes.
18206|0|While despair underlies Almodovar's film...the director attempts to lighten up with some misplaced jokes. These, though, are never any more than a brief respite from the irritating mess in which the characters embroil themselves.
55137|0|A third-rate conflation of Midnight Run and It Happened One Night, Serving Sara relies heavily on Perry's perpetually exasperated shtick, which fits more comfortably among the democratic ensemble of TV's Friends.
31405|1|Great songs and stars and a pretty good script, too
68241|1|enjoyable fluff
19968|1|The perfect satirical horror. Brilliant observations about the genre, the media and the goth scene. Hilarious, and you actually care about the characters.
517|1|The characters (both animal and human) are solidly conceived, and the storytelling and visuals are expertly fashioned.
3816|0|The presence of Washington lends the picture a much-needed dose of authenticity. But in the end Virtuosity is disconnected and uninvolving.
29747|1|It's not a masterpiece, but it is a fast-moving thriller, one worth revisiting (and, evidently, remaking).
9759|1|Broderick knows exactly what he wants to do as a director and does it.
78314|1|"Word ""great"" doesn't do justice to what Imelda Staunton delivers with her performance."
33510|1|Has a verve and cheekiness that's partly a smart wedding of such influences as Sergio Leone, George Miller and south-of-the-border noir.
43894|1|This is a very well crafted fly-on-the-wall style documentary.
27656|1|Darker and more intimate than you expect.
40799|1|Unfunny, at times morose, comedy-drama about standup comics.
51384|0|It made me yearn for the golden era of January, when Slackers was released.
19722|0|A film that so conclusively promises to be the last entry in the popular Nightmare on Elm Street series that the title tries to prove it twice.
33681|1|Gone Baby Gone is an argument for obligation over accommodation, the absolute over the contingent.
16366|1|A real pleasant surprise with a less brash, more likable Seagal. Manages to show a genuine affection for the kind of rural folks elitist Hollywood usually ridicules.
60942|1|Reygadas has talent to match his ambitions; or, rather, gifts that undercut them sufficiently to give his film a prickly, haunting poignancy.
55462|1|Provides enough solid, character-based amusement to put customers in the chairs and send them out content with services rendered.
33678|1|Because it mostly succeeds, now that [Affleck's] got this and that good under-seen performance in Hollywoodland under his belt, he can hold his head high again.
79980|1|...a surprisingly sturdy first effort for a filmmaker who would (obviously) go onto bigger and better things.
32680|1|Unsettling documentary is a gripping study of the banality of evil.
52664|1|An unforgettable and haunting film about longing and loss, Salmonberries has a visceral energy that is as powerful as its isolated snowy Alaskan locations. The icing on the cake is an evocative soundtrack ..
72661|1|Spectacular film.
59727|0|Although it was a brave movie at the time, it's got less power than the average soap opera these days.
72606|0|Kinda stupid, really.
32560|0|With few surprises and little to say in this film, it is unclear why Oliver Stone was interested in making it in the first place.
69097|1|Sex Wars mid-century style. Adam's Rib can't help but look a bit dated, but it sure is a perfect encapsulation of a certain type of couple at a certain time.
14561|0|If Son were as strong in its storytelling as its characters are in their convictions, it would be more than well-acted political soap.
13009|1|Fast paced with a satisfyingly unhappy ending.
24486|0|Am I the only one who thinks the aliens ate all those folks they spirited away?
77260|1|Scorsese shows his range as a filmmaker and proves what makes him so good: he's a director with an eye for fancy camera work but a heart for his characters and the journeys they take.
14182|0|[Burton's] dark, melancholy vision is undeniably something to see, but it is a claustrophobic conception, not an expansive one, oppressive rather than exhilarating, and it strangles almost all the enjoyment out of this movie without half trying.
47345|1|Exemplifies the rich, acquired taste of the Roeg film.
89705|0|Has the makings of a mediocre, after-school sitcom
43577|1|A beautiful and challenging film.
3073|1|Atmospheric but watery romantic melodrama
15797|1|[A] hilarious comedy, directed with boisterous wit by Barry Sonnenfeld.
64334|1|Amusing mock-doc that sends up the self-delusions low-budget directors often force themsleves to labor under.
100556|1|The documentary curriculum is sex, gossip and self-pity. Not exactly original, but disturbingly true.
66858|0|Too polished to be truly creepy, The Return has more than enough atmosphere to keep you watching - but nowhere near enough mystery.
44261|0|Bumbles along from scene to scene without developing any suspense or comic momentum.
80624|1|The name says it all, and the movie delivers.
95068|0|A weak satire of network television programming, telling you nothing you don't already know and doing so without providing much more than the occsasional mild chuckle.
43568|1|A film this bizarre and spectacular can't be entirely written off.
59325|1|Retains its power to amuse and enthrall 65 years after its debut.
28212|1|Great comedic pairing. Good fun.
46847|1|Mindless entertainment of the highest order.
52647|0|'Promising juvenilia' is about the most one can say for it.
49005|1|It's a frighteningly realistic look at completely passionless sex, and Fox and Rylance both do a good job of making us uncomfortable as we watch.
64422|0|You'll shake your head in disbelief at the nonsensical plot machinations and idiotic character motivations required to bring the two terror titans together.
8247|0|This dark and brooding sequel is an absolute pain to watch.
38726|1|Weak and saggy script meets predictable plot.
44724|0|We realize early on that nothing much is going to happen ... and it's hard to stay fully engaged with a film that, frontal nudity notwithstanding, plays it so safe.
77794|1|"Beautifully crafted, daringly staged, and movingly scored, ""AKA"" is a triumph of British cinema (and cinema in general)."
101190|0|Tells [a] ludicrously compact, aggressively 'heartfelt,' colorfully contrived story.
15902|0|Mangold is something of a pseudo-Scorsese.
63144|1|It's a message movie, as are all kids films these days, but these environmentally-aware messages are sweet and unforced, and well worth hearing.
94224|0|Goya, aqui, é o coadjuvante de luxo de uma história que não faz jus nem mesmo aos seus protagonistas.
43800|0|Dated before it was made.
93133|0|Although extremely slow moving and hard to sit through, 'Catch and Release' focuses on characters who genuinely care about each other.
58555|0|The script is so lazy it snores, and Wayne Wang directs like he walked onto the wrong set - true enough, in its way.
78802|1|Everything an independent film should be: daring, experimental, character-driven and thoroughly entertaining.
82364|1|Penn's agonized performance in this under-the-radar drama is better than his Oscar-winning work in Mystic River.
92826|1|[Director] Winkler clearly loves these characters, and if he sometimes pushes too hard in his effort to make the audience share his affection it's forgivable under the circumstances.
61970|1|No one will claim that the pre-teen market is saturated with movies for girls, thus The Lizzie McGuire Movie is a welcome addition that fills the bill...
43537|1|The whole two-hours-plus affair just soars along, brainlessly and breathlessly.
34923|0|Stylish exploitation vigilante thriller.
29261|1|Scar-eeee!
48863|0|not quite enough actual Titanic
57484|1|A true classic Cold War comedy told with wit, slapstick, and paranoia.
21205|0|This is Carl Reiner's cleverly adapted spoof on noir films of the post-World War 11 days.
24926|1|A compelling film!
30412|1|Fosse gets his kicks (and so will you) directing his own boffo bio flick.
72747|0|While it carries some strong performances, the script and direction (by actress Diane Keaton) are far from superior.
71085|1|Very shrewdly designed to work as a mystery thriller -- complete with red herrings -- and it undeniably holds the viewer's interest throughout with the mystery.
21203|1|Mainly for the noir geeks and the Steve Martin fans -- and I'm both.
24940|1|The lack of time gives the last reel a fakey, tied-up-with-a-bow feeling, but good performances and a good script make this an enjoyable little romance.
28129|1|There are moments when the movie doesn't seem to know where it's going, but for once that's a good thing because the uncertainty almost always ends with some kind of a delightful, weird surprise.
60566|0|It's completely forgettable and unoriginal, but it might make a good rental on a slow family movie night.
58485|1|Deathtrap is a literate, swiftly paced and engrossing screen adaptation of Ira Levin's Broadway smash.
101457|1|A fine example of Ray's directorial mastery.
57758|1|As a tearjerker this works pretty well, though long before it gets to work on your tear ducts, it starts to eat away at your nerves.
47615|1|Tomei and D'Onofrio imbue their roles with the requisite warmth and fragility.
84015|0|The talented players work hard to sell it, but all too often Woman is over-intellectualized and self-consciously arty.
5147|0|The film starts better than you've heard, but soon gets worse than you predicted.
16568|1|Unusual documentary pointless but engrossing.
10716|1|Yes, Allen has made better movies -- lots of them -- but I'm not sure he ever made anything funnier.
99649|1|Kung Fu Panda is a colourful, extremely enjoyable if workmanlike animated romp.
36735|1|With Donen and Kelly at the musical helm, it's no surprise that the song-and-dance numbers are top notch.
32745|0|So riddled with live-action Disney movie clichés that I kept waiting for Cruella de Ville to show up and threaten to skin the dog alive.
6344|1|If shoot-'em-up, gobble-'em-down movies like The Fugitive and Jurassic Park are rated PG-13 these days, what does an R-rated action adventure look like? Like True Romance: violent to a fault, glam to the max.
39794|0|Not particularly watchable until the climax.
61643|1|There's no better tribute to the beauty of flight than Jacques Perrin's lighter-than-air documentary wonder.
13146|0|It's a lot of utterly preposterous fun, even if it doesn't quite hang together.
38263|1|One of the saddest little orphans in the whole of the Disney animated features canon... though the film hits more than it misses over the course of its ten sequences.
83891|1|One story, two versions, each from Woody Allen, so you know you're in for it.
94530|0|Movies need not always be uplifting. Comedies don't always have to be happy. That said Mike White's Year of the Dog is downright depressing without revealing much of the human condition it strives to.
16781|0|Suffers from its aloof and uninviting approach.
62348|0|The same old grab for the wallet.
10504|0|Watching the wan Christopher Eccleston as Jude and Kate Winslet as his cousin and lover Sue Bridehead, an audience might well wonder what all the fuss was about.
83180|1|Tough, lyrical, and one the screen's great romantic tragedies.
92341|0|Linklater is preaching to the converted.
87441|0|Fans of the original might greet this adaptation with mixed emotions, while curious newcomers are left with an earnest but ultimately pointless big-screen byproduct.

24598|0|I mean no disrespect to Rodney Dangerfield in suggesting that Back to School is a comedy that belongs back on the drawing board.
7195|0|"After watching this catastrophe, it's almost hard to believe that Ray Liotta was in ""Goodfellas."""

3431|1|Stylish Raimi western is violent, unpredictable.
34414|1|A successful tribute to an era of optimism and competitiveness which was bitchin' -- and now seems very far in the past.
94522|1|Shannon seems like quite an unorthodox choice for such a subdued, minimalistic character, but White actually wrote the part for her and she does him proud.
60546|1|It's so sugary that the adults in the audience should beware of the dangers of Type 2 Diabetes, though overall this is a great film to take the kids to during the school holidays.
73166|1|The Parallax View is one of the great paranoid thrillers of the 1970s. Which, when you consider how paranoid America was post-Watergate, is high praise indeed.
16100|1|It comes off smarter and creepier than I recall the original, less about scares than a sustained atmosphere of eerie unease and skittery threats.
65101|0|It's a lame slapstick actioner in which Jackie Chan lets CGI effects take the heat instead of his arthritic joints.
55753|1|Even the digressions are funny.
52617|0|It is not the first time that director Sara Sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them.
6293|1|Part avant-garde art film, part amusing but morbid fairy tale, it is a delightfully ghoulish holiday musical that displays more inventiveness in its brief 75 minutes than some studios can manage in an entire year.

41326|0|The climax actually pits Milo against Winston in a typing contest. If that sounds thrilling, this may be the movie you've been waiting for.

46713|0|Disappointment comes from the sense that the picture started off with the promise of being something different, maybe even something scathing, but then settles for something rather routine.
19855|0|Worst of the series, Jason doesn't really take anything.
95437|0|There's a great half-hour show rattling around in here somewhere, but the rest is padding at its very dullest.
29899|1|An American's quest for the meaning of life takes him from Iowa to Tibet to discover the spiritual practices of equanimity, atttention, and compassion.
69936|1|It's harmless fun with a breezy '80s ambiance -- a neon playground with a cross-eyed soundtrack, smoky widescreen cinematography, and a cool snapshot of Dice when he was king of the world.
26852|1|An exquisite film about the after-life experience that lingers in the mind and in the senses for many days.
28738|0|With no real plot tying them together, the impressively staged big scenes become empty exercises in logistics, while the smaller scenes never develop any momentum.

77465|1|...a great way to release some urban angst.
47342|0|A dry, depressing film that, frankly, isn't entertaining enough to make anyone but the truly masochistic fork over $14 to hear how the world as we know it is going to end.
41910|0|Their weapons make a Fourth of July sparkler show, but they almost never hit anybody.

77420|0|Epic in ambition, awful in delivery.

66894|0|In turning the poet's life into a package, the filmmakers have done a disservice both to her memory and to their audience.
20920|0|Certain movies engage your affections so strongly that, even if they start to fall apart, you tend to keep rooting for them. That's pretty much the case with Newsies.
55986|0|...a well-intentioned but saccharine comedy... In fact, that's its problem. It doesn't do much of anything but meet our lowest expectations.
899|1|There are a few broad laughs and Ferrell is everything you would expect him to be - irritating, occasionally amusing and sometimes inspired
18750|1|Chris Carter had the daunting task of pleasing fans of the show, while at the same time not alienating those new to it. It's a balancing act that he mostly achieved, but in the end it's probably best enjoyed by those who are already fans.

63656|1|A quirky story about young love in the 1930s and all of its intense aches and longings.

65949|1|It demonstrates without overreaching what an actual teacher can do to shape lives.

35514|1|Funny and harmless family entertainment.
30349|0|Mervyn LeRoy, who produced and directed, has lost a great deal of the bite of the play.

54209|1|The dialogue is sharp and insightful, the cast is superb, the performances are rock-solid, the story is provocative and multilayered.
58574|0|Infelizmente, há muito tempo a série deixou de ser sobre seus personagens e passou a priorizar os efeitos visuais - e o roteiro do sempre medíocre John Logan, com sua trama datada e seus péssimos diálogos, só piora a situação.

40392|0|How come these bad guys have such bad aim? Does everybody in real life say something funny after they kill a person? Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
64560|1|The Bond films never feel dated, and neither does Agent Cody Banks. It still plays well, and for that credit the special effects that compare favorably to today's films and the fact that high school never seems to change.
55285|0|Paul Mazursky hasn't only remade Jean Renoir's sublime 1931 Boudu Saved From Drowning: he's yuppified it, inverting virtually every meaning until the film becomes a celebration of the crassest kind of materialism.
90210|0|This piece of junk is so bad that even Paul Walker turned it down.
42092|0|An overwrought film that, in the third act, collapses into pretentious symbolism, art-film abstraction without real purpose, and unintentional comedy.

36233|1|Scheider looks great as the well-dressed cool guy and Olivier turns in his most notoriously frightening performance.
57970|1|While Tattoo borrows heavily from both Seven and The Silence of the Lambs, it manages to maintain both a level of sophisticated intrigue and human-scale characters that suck the audience in.
29999|1|A wonderfully perverse noir classic...
40465|0|Looks like what it really is -- a 77-minute long episode of the TV series projected onto a theater screen.
34290|0|It's films like this that give B-films and Southern hillbillies a bad name.
63477|1|Never less than entertaining and is sometimes side-splittingly hilarious.
59231|1|Godard, the cocky provocateur, breaks every rule of filmmaking he can muster...[it's] a rejection of traditions--all of 'em, de qualité or otherwise--and an embrace of the new.
58026|1|A harrowing account of a psychological breakdown.
5401|1|The acting's so good it frequently transcends the simplicities of the script, and whenever Day-Lewis or Postlethwaite is on-screen the movie crackles.
38963|0|I don't know if I'm getting more squeamish, or simply less charitable at being exploitatively manipulated and taken for a moron: possibly both. But I think others will share my disgust at several scenes in Bless The Child.

93636|1|It's noisy, nonsensical, and will fade from your consciousness even before you make it out of the theater lobby, but it's entertaining enough, and Tamahori throws us a few curve balls to keep things interesting.
93608|0|Not as inspiring as it should be.
21279|0|Overlong, over-produced Stephen King byproduct. Forget it along with Firestarter, In the Mouth of Madness, Maximum Overdrive, and all the others.
92099|1|upscale Bondian thriller without the silly special effects
90473|1|Their world of puzzles is like an alternate universe and this film offers a window into it.
57649|1|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is good enough to satisfy hard-core fans, even if it falls short of being truly transporting moviemaking.
61035|1|An informative, heartbreaking documentary about intolerance and manipulation, sadly and assuredly never to be seen by the people who need this info the most.
40123|0|There's nothing here that's liable to set you pondering metaphysical questions, but Bedazzled is a perfectly reasonable excuse for a none-too-bright Hollywood comedy.
12417|1|A funny film, and it's fresh even today, though it's not a knee-slapper. Rather, it's a shrug-your-shoulder-and-grin kind of movie.

73901|1|We may never again see a teen comedy in which a school can explode and the movie can still be considered essentially good-hearted.
100766|0|It's a claustrophobic dud, full of ludicrously purple tough-guy dialogue and lip-smacking vamps in bikinis (how hot!), with so much monotonous hip violence there's scarcely room for anything else.
98534|0|This is not without its attractions - an occasionally waspishly witty script and some unexpected dramatic tangents - but the characters never seem more than a casually bagged collection of tics and mannerisms.
58771|1|The thriller maintains a high quality of production values despite lacking a convincing message.
55671|1|It is like a picture poem, with its sunshine and happiness in the beginning and its stormy drama in the end.

52035|1|He's Just Not That Into You is a standard chick flick, which isn't necessarily a bad thing: it's cute and comic and organized according to fixed, mostly ancient gender roles.

55897|1|Inspiring sports-underdog story for tweens and up.
9483|1|By switching the main character's gender and adding romantic sparks, Hawks turned the masterful, raucous Chicago newsroom farce The Front Page into the perfect screwball comedy.

10628|1|Brave and impressive stuff.

56885|1|There are some neat performances, particularly Travolta's convincing bid to be taken seriously after years of being dismissed as frivolous beefcake.
72863|1|If only these sequels could have kept going...
59566|1|This poor-man's 'Exodus' brings to life the struggle of an illegal shipment of Jews to Palestine just weeks before the declaration of the State of Israel.
87157|0|The plot isn't intellectually challenging as much as it is confusing, and yet the big twist is completely telegraphed. Ritchie has created a movie that is patronizingly obvious one minute and impenetrable the next.
57472|1|This dated comedy is saved by Lemmon's comedic genius which eschews macho.
12193|1|Ran remains gripping because it depicts not only the long-ago past, but also our hellish present.
94779|0|The same kind of lightweight but well executed comic book-based romp as its predecessor.
89418|0|A lazy little product of mediocrity that will be woefully outdated in the next year...
75108|0|Should be required viewing for film students studying why 1960s sitcom fare is so outdated.
79226|1|No curses or Cat People.

91733|1|a welcome and honorable telling of the Purim story.
17548|0|Spiers' pseudo-documentary bubble-and-squeak allows the girls to dress up, dress down, change identities, ride around in a Union Jack bus, rub shoulders with a large cameo cast, and indulge in vacuous banter. Help!
100306|0|Houdini's mission to debunk fake spiritualists is hijacked by this wholly fraudulent love story. There's not a moment in the film that feels honest and uncontrived.
46032|1|Ed O'Bannon and John Russo may have intended The Return of the Living Dead as a comedy, but it's just too damn gory, too scary and too good to be dismissed as a zom com.
34505|1|Creatively filmed political thriller
33718|1|Zany character portrayal of two lonely thirtysomething misfits who are opposites but nevertheless find romance together despite many obstacles in their path.
1717|0|A veritable cold shower of a sequel to 1992's softcore spectacular.
19951|0|"While it's certainly not as atrocious as the likes of ""One Missed Call,"" it's certainly one of the worst of 2008, so far..."
15753|1|...a movie that not only expected me to pay attention, it assumed that I could.
72398|1|We've grown accustomed to more violent, more suspenseful, and scarier stories than these, but there's no questioning the quality of this film.
76345|0|Catwoman's director, a visual-effects specialist named Pitof, is not contained by the rules of filmmaking. Scenes that make sense? Nonsense. Characters with inner lives? Utterly passe.
52080|0|There is so much high drama and splendid triumph that the movie loses any basis in reality, so it's impossible to relate to what anyone's enduring
96820|1|An amusing and heartfelt exploration of the ups and downs involved when adopting a child -- in this case, one who insists he's from another planet.
27838|0|No one has ever accused Ghostbusters II of being a great film, or even a good one, for that matter
20674|0|With writing like this, can an Academy Award be far behind?
58731|1|A decent soundtrack rounds off a surprisingly engaging and energetic little-kids' adventure.
56507|1|It doesn't have a narrative arc so much as it sips from the snifter of the life of a comedian, but that does not detract from its interest one bit.
71305|1|Bergman's debut feature is tender yet disturbing, sad yet at times funny.
38515|1|(Stewart's character) finishes the film an enigma, possibly the good go-getter of Capra but too much of a shadow.
99366|1|A winsome homage to Albert Lamorisse's classic children's fantasy short film of 1956 The Red Balloon.
13586|1|A smart, ironic documentary.
21474|1|There really is no better geek than Anthony Michael Hall.
2623|1|The movie comes closest to thematic coherence, and the popular mood, in its depiction of something nearly everyone can relate to: the office from hell.
5535|0|Lightning Jack feels like a film you might stumble across late at night on the USA Network.
28111|1|A measured, brooding meander through dreams of loyalty, shadows of treachery, and the particular psychoses of celebrity for those on both sides of stardom...
8966|1|One of the great musicals.
70438|0|Not terrible, but this MTV teen movie falls flat.
56249|1|Gary Cooper brings the Yankee legend to life with great honesty and emotion.
14998|0|Too weird, even for David Lynch
4752|0|Plays more like National Lampoon's Seattle Vacation than a sly comedy/drama about undercover cops.
72261|1|there are some amazing standout performances (Cate Blanchett, Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan). Otherwise, it's just a bit of diverting fluff.
66253|0|No one in this movie can be accused of doing his best.
36352|1|This somewhat autobiographical piece goes heavy on the melodrama and employs humor in short bursts.
58952|1|Is this a light-hearted romp? Is this a psychological drama? Is it a thriller? Can it be all three? Not quite, Sort of. Uh Uh. And dear lord no.

78343|1|Every so often there comes a must-see movie. This one's a must-hear.
101073|0|To put it bluntly, Babylon A.D. is a cluttered mess. Characters have been under developed, realtionships have no chemistry, and its conclusion feels rushed and leaves too many unresolved questions.
94010|0|Filled with sentimentality, pretensions, unfulfilled ambitions and a host of dull characters faced with life threatening problems that verge on the ludicrous.
22782|0|Indecent Proposal should prove once and for all that Robert Redford can rescue even the dumbest movie, just by showing up and flashing that killer smile.
65568|1|A magical, old-fashioned musical.
29595|1|For escapist fare, this ranks highly
32251|1|Of all the movies based on King novels, The Green Mile ranks near the top -- but below Darabont's first, The Shawshank Redemption.
32740|0|Not even foxy sociopath Angelina Jolie can save this nut-house drama.
47083|1|Wildly funny and deeply disturbing.
4531|1|The leads work overtime to make their characters and their relationships pungent, believable, and moving.
71309|1|As rewarding a 90 minutes as you can devote to a subject who did his best to remain eternally unknowable.
8792|1|It's a bit dated now, but still has much to offer, notably George Cukor's intelligent direction.
59743|1|Inspired by Bergman's Smiles of a Summer Night, andwith a touch of Renoir's Rules of the Game, this period comedy is a minor work, a trifle in Allen's career, worth seeing for some of the supporting acting.
98876|0|So bereft of creativity that it fails even to deliver to its base--teenage boys--the ghouls and boobs they so desperately want to see.
26750|1|There's no question Night of the Comet was made in the 1980s, and that's a positive for people who have enjoyed similarly silly sci-fi flicks like Return of the Living Dead, Night of the Creeps and other delightfully airy efforts from that decade.
58263|0|Simply another crudely made, explicitly violent '70s-era exploitation flick.
19989|0|A faded memory of the series' superior former self.
87874|1|Sarah Watt's unexpectedly hopeful tribute to the fragility of human life and the feelings of helplessness...
428|0|Passion, like outpourings of iambic pentameter, isn't part of this picture's equation.
21081|0|Better save this for nostalgia only -- kids won't be missing anything if they never encounter this relic.
29425|1|Director Lawrence Kasdan's small-town fable beguiles.
60151|1|A fascinating, consummately crafted and ultimately moving study of a man who conforms surprisingly closely to western archetypes of the artist as rebel and hedonist.
25418|0|An uneasy mesh of character-driven privileged moments and occasionally muddled melodrama.
100264|1|Delivering an emotional punch to the gut in the final reel, this engaging account of an under-reported tragedy will remind you how cinema can still rise to the occasion and go beyond the empty bangs and flashes of tent pole releases.
27073|1|there are some inspired twists at the end
54707|1|The whole mildly pleasant outing -- the R rating is for brief nudity and a grisly corpse -- remains aloft not on its own self-referential hot air, but on the inspired performance of Tim Allen.
29831|1|This charming film (aka Handle With Care) was a commercial failure, but it holds up well and resonates more strongly when examined vis-a-vis Demme's other communal films, Melvin and Howard and Something Wild.
59731|0|One of Lucio Fulci's worst, and that's saying something.
15451|1|Thankfully low on sentimentality, director Reitman gives the two stand-up talents a pretty free rein, resulting in some classic comic moments and snappy one-liners.
51234|1|...my tolerance for Shirley Temple's brand of sugary lightheartedness is rather limited.... But it would be churlish of me to deny the little moppet's winning charisma.
35011|1|The unapologetically hokey humor and dialogue and characters have their charms for sheer late-'80s kitsch value.
43527|0|Ratatouille isn't a bad movie, just one that doesn't do enough of what it does well.
93044|1|The movie provides a fine, shiny reminiscence of school days, when learning three guitar chords in the right order was the most important thing in the world.
23096|1|The film lurches ... toward greatness, dazzling the viewer with a spectacular view of heaven that is not only beautiful but also profoundly moving.
71851|1|The agenda is obvious, but the rage feels justified, and meanwhile Lee gives us a few virtuoso touches.

19763|0|If slasher movies are your thing, take a stab at this one.
3922|1|First-time director Iain Softley makes the film more visually distinctive than most music bios.

75419|1|worthy of strong consideration
28859|0|Languorous and oddly detached.
12594|0|Listen, come over to my place this weekend; we'll rewatch Terminator 1 and 2, we'll listen to 'You Could Be Mine' by Guns N Roses, we can even discuss Edward Furlong's 'career'. And let's just pretend Terminator Salvation never happened.
42663|0|Trite and tiresome.
36913|1|A haunting ghost story.
20571|0|Despite an encouraging start, the film degenerates into typical Disney sentimentality.
54335|0|The humour is sufficiently scattershot to hit the mark once or twice, but basically a no-brains comedy.
34784|0|A tiresome and pointless film where Pacino is wasted as a witness to a parade of lunatics.
45973|0|Dreyfuss tries hard ... and almost saves the whole darn thing.
73237|0|It's funny at first, but then loses its way so badly that it somehow winds up as a high-tech espionage thriller.
85563|0|It's basically the videogame version of Top Gun... on steroids!
10882|1|...one of the most impressive debut features in cinematic history.
86186|1|Two men of very different generations coming to understand and appreciate each other makes for some fine moments. And that's just the actors.
41176|0|like a collegiate literature class in Thomas Hardy
25364|1|Heartbreak Ridge offers another vintage Clint Eastwood performance.
90912|1|Gilliam appears to be trying to throw us all off-guard, to make the theatergoing experience unpleasant. But in its own unlovable way, the movie is an unforgettable experience.
91898|1|Fetishists are people, too!
71226|0|Stunningly bad teen sex comedy.
49822|1|Goes over the top and beyond in grandly heroic and even superheroic style, in a way unmatched by any war movie since Rambo: First Blood Part II.
14098|1|Shows just how difficult it is to practice peace
39739|1|It's still great, exhibiting a far superior sense of wit and comic timing than virtually any film released in the last twenty years.
100507|1|Even if the material is familiar, even if it has been done well before, there is room in a great book for a new interpretation.
8898|1|Certainly a more accomplished cast of players cannot be imagined, and their direction by Michael Curtiz is inspired.
23921|0|What was considered shocking in the 1970s seems benign today.
60476|0|None of its characters have any sort of inner life and their motivations are simply to fulfill the goals of the screenplay.
32155|0|The film was cast wrong and written shallowly.
27944|1|This taut crime picture was one of the earliest films in the career of Stanley Kubrick, but something of the director's voice and characteristic preoccupations are already evident here.
53157|1|Before Tony Hawk, skateboarding had the Z-Boys.
45250|1|Masterful direction and cinematography are shown off in this restored version, with Bernstein's apt jazzy score nailing all the right notes.
38712|0|There are two ways to not see this invisible man. The best option is skipping the movie.
5433|1|A tight, energetic sleeper in the action-adventure genre, manages to pack a few anti-machismo sentiments into an otherwise brawny tale.
26109|0|High-tech remake is dumb and overblown.
29542|1|thought-provoking and truthful ...
81004|1|The wonderful thing about Interview is that we have no idea where it is going to lead. It's honest, conflicted and surprising, as journalist and actress battle words and emotions in a potent drama that takes us to unexpected places
24027|1|One of the more quotable comedies of the 1980s
40478|0|It makes me truly fearful of having to sit through 103 Dalmatians, which will be an inevitability after this one makes another $100 million.
56450|1|Harks back to a time when movies had more to do with imagination than market research.
73111|0|The writing here is routine, with superficial characters and plotting that isn't particularly exciting.
70186|1|Pumping iron is as satisfying as having sex with a woman and reaching orgasm, says Arnold Schwarzenegger in this fascinating1977 documentary
59346|1|Writer-Director Wilder has fashioned an ironic, worldly, yet sternly moral comedy that gives an energizing twist to every farcical convention and finds the perfect timing for every rubber-faced reaction to calamity.
50390|0|An ambitious-but-off-kilter film that desperately searches for but never finds its mark.
22710|0|The film has a kind of airless, artificial quality that made it seem much longer than it actually was.
32420|1|The IMAX presentation of this millennial sequel is a welcome addition to the family, though it seems to lack the heart of the original.
63309|0|[Johnnie To and Wai Ka Fai are] sure to find an enthusiastic audience among American action-adventure buffs, but the film's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers.
61206|1|A marvel of closely observed, intimately captivating moments.

20031|0|...falls right in line with its entirely underwhelming predecessor...
14367|1|Sharp, inventive and hilarious, with a marvellous cast of Coen regulars.
57479|1|Arkin, in his film bow, is absolutely outstanding as the courtly Russian who kisses a lady's hand even as he draws a gun.
44760|1|Anyone who loved L'Auberge Espagnole should at least like its sequel as something of a guilty fling.
63858|0|The weakest of the three films in the series.
40369|0|This is one of the weakest Bonds, with its plot about diamond smuggling developing rather tiresomely into a chase with Moon buggies and Connery simply going through the motions.
77304|0|This whiny, unpleasant comedy of infidelity makes a good case for staying celibate with the phone unplugged.
24650|1|A great underdog story, and you gotta love the flying crane.
35384|1|A funny and warm polemical comedy that celebrates the political and social values of the Paris demonstrations of May 1968.
53946|0|I didn't expect a comedy.
4336|0|It's a good example of an anti-establishment comedy crippled by a seeming desire to infatuate the establishment itself. What Reality Bites needs most is a good bite. From reality.
29299|0|a work of hideous myopathy
1799|0|It's not clear why Steven Spielberg's Amblin decided to make a live-action entertainment starring the least interesting and most saccharine of all 50s cartoon characters.
76354|1|Widely considered a terrible movie, but if you enjoy the camp genre, it's a must-see. It is, in fact, camp on a catnip high.
13546|1|Paris, Texas uses the familiar thematic construct of the Western, and is conducted in somber nostalgia.
79681|1|No masterpiece by any means, it's at times overplayed, but it's striking visually, handling swift horizontal movement very well. It's also genuinely erotic.
79365|1|One of Jules Dassin's best features is a quintessential film noir, distinguished by its on-location shooting and Daniels' sharp imagery, which deservedly won the Oscar
100577|1|Present-day interviews and modern re-enactments provide the piece with its structure, but it's the awe-inspiring archival footage that makes this a giddy watch.
81342|0|Certains films sont davantage une démonstration d'animation qu'une histoire bien construite.
61365|0|The whole extravaganza could have made for a plucky 70 minutes, but it packs on an additional three-quarters of an hour of saw-toothed melodrama.
33083|0|It's hard to determine exactly where I gave up on Down to You, but I'm pretty sure it was right after the opening credits.
47686|0|The writers have swiped Lee's basic premise and main characters, while pretty much ignoring his skill and sensitivity.
62107|1|"[""Daddy Day Care""] is a straightforward, don't-expect-any-surprises kind of pre-summer entertainment that has a good supporting cast, precocious kids and a premise that lends itself to slapstick comedy."
5885|1|In his first starring role, comedian Leary makes his ranting career criminal strangely sympathetic.

14281|0|A living testament to how low a studio will stoop to generate a few bucks.
14667|0|In the end, it's more a role-playing game scenario than a plot -- although there someone would have worked out rules that make sense.
97607|0|A film that subjects us to one of the more irritating and unlikable leading men in recent romantic comedy history.
1620|1|It was impossible in The Basketball Diaries not to take notice of DiCaprio's seemingly undauntable talent, as he channeled the tortures of the drug-addicted damned. [Blu-ray]

13598|0|Streitfeld is only fitfully successful.
84665|0|Given the graphic sex scenes, it is surprisingly dull. The music isn't great, either, now that we think about it.
17308|0|You've seen better mysteries on Murder She Wrote, you'll hear better dialogue in an Ed Wood flick, and you'll experience better sex scenes on a hot day at your local zoo.
67558|0|If Bad Santa does well at the box office, Zwigoff will get credit for being a savvy player. That Bad Santa is as vile and stupid as Ghost World was insightful and touching is something Hollywood has no interest in measuring.
52369|1|The first 'Road' picture has its undeniable charms, but isn't as wild as the later entries.

80146|1|Comedy horror that really does give Vincent Price a chance to do his stuff, with deliciously absurd results.
62470|0|With the tiniest bit of effort, Wrong Turn could have been a fun slasher flick, but no one involved seems to have cared about anything but a paycheck.
39241|1|Star Trek works by paying homage to the past without being chained down by its history.

40742|1|A forceful and admirably heartfelt performance by Tom Cruise galvanizes this picture, which should be more powerful than it is considering the darkness and fullness of the emotions at its center.
81003|0|I can't get on the Sienna Miller bandwagon. I can damn with faint praise: she's perfectly competent as an actor -- but that's it.
70454|0|Unfortunately, here's the new math: Promising premise + pretty good heist plan = One Bad Movie.
6251|0|One of the most lame comedy whodunnits ever to make it to the screen.
35694|0|Something of a mess, both in terms of the wayward plot which rambles all over the place, and in terms of the rather muddled juggling of audience sympathies.
20290|1|'... Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan get their freak on with a sublime synchronicity that matches the original.'
8171|1|Ransom is more cleverly conceived than most run-of-the-mill Hollywood exploitation thrillers, and for a while appears headed to a memorable, richly ironic conclusion.
29032|1|This is great cinema: supremely entertaining, mature storytelling.
81457|0|Is it a docudrama about South Africa's post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings? Or is it love story? The problem with In My Country is that it tries to be both.
33735|0|Three-fifths of a great movie sunk by a crucial tonal misstep. A cross between Lord of the Flies, Swiss Family Robinson and Apocalypse Now.
44354|1|A well-acted, thoughtful piece that shows what it may have been like living in Nazi-occupied portions of Europe, particularly in ethnically mixed Czechoslovakia.
97648|0|What a maddening waste of Katherine Heigl this insipid romantic comedy is.
5292|1|Stone has a keen directorial eye, and Heaven and Earth is usually interesting to watch.

4913|0|'They dropped everything for a good cause' would seem to refer more to the filmmakers than the gutsy, middle-aged women shedding their clothes for a hospital couch.
90007|0|The film is a mishmash of half-baked jokes, sitcom scenarios and Owen Wilson attempting to float by on his charm.
75228|1|Big budget, elaborate sci-fi. Nice to look at, but rather slow.
70535|0|A little too true to it sources and ends up reminding you just how boring inept acting, editing and story-telling can be.
2354|0|Despite its fascinating subject matter, Total Eclipse is both unflattering and loveless.
77646|0|Few films have title more deserving.
48753|1|Offbeat friendship is provocative, dark, but sweet.
87066|1|Blanchett is superb as Tracy, a recognisable and believable character attempting to put her past behind her.
70912|0|What the audience ends up with is a watered down whitewash of Kallen's life story.
43970|0|Cinematic loitering... enough to make you yearn for the halcyon days of, ya know, adulthood...
84194|1|Forces the audience to ride the waves of some complicated relationships without having a built-in hero or heroine for which to root.
91469|1|Taxidermia sets a benchmark for body horror in the cinema.

91306|1|A cautionary, sci-fi comedy which envisions a miserable dystopia half a millenia in the future where humanity has degenerated instead of advanced.
76862|1|There are some deliberate and successful moments of comedy that do not undercut the seriousness of the war, but effectively accommodate the more absurd moments.
98087|1|Even if it collapses in on itself a bit, there's still a rough power underneath everything that makes it worth a look.
17471|1|It is fun when people with Hollywood clout decide to do something as fast and loose as this...
94913|0|It is pretty boring. But then the gore is even worse to watch.
36985|1|Certainly no worse than the later Roger Moore efforts and, if only for curiosity value, is well worth a look.
29155|0|On the field, Costner is consistent, but his exploration of Billy's romantic dilemma is superficial and often wooden.

94731|0|my biggest road block was the fact that I didn't like the music
5430|0|This is an exceedingly well directed, cleverly filmed and edited, tension-filled affair. It is also a wholly preposterous, muddled, paranoid view of the inner-city nightmare where the slightest misstep is sure to have a fateful result.
4490|0|Cerebral werewolf yarn that just doesn't work.
95161|1|Though not especially original, this is frightening and disturbing film and the effects take a while to wear off.
3634|1|A criminally underrated film, featuring one of Spacey's best performances.
35831|1|One belly laughing sequence after another.
85997|0|As magical as classic fairy tales may seem to be, a winking Gilliam is out to prove here that to a profoundly superstitious, stressed out early 19th century world, those legends were as frighteningly real as any documentary or even reality show today.
87131|1|Watch it passively and you might wonder how it even qualifies as a movie; watch it with your full attention and you will see a charming and surprisingly meaningful look at adolescent angst.
2275|0|Tasteless, tawdry, and guaranteed to leave you rolling in the aisles... the best bad filmmaking Hollywood has to offer.
45450|1|"Warmly filmed (despite the latitude), sharply scripted narration, with an appropriate score. ""Whether or not we ever reach Alaska, we all want to know that such a place still exists."
90611|1|Check your brain at the box-office to enjoy this brand of politically-incorrect hilarity poking fun mostly at gays, women and the French, all aimed at a redneck crowd with an average I.Q. of about 75.
35216|0|The mixture of puerile double entendres, vomit humor, dumb-blonde and dumb-jock jokes, and smarmy last-minute sentiment on display here is pretty much beyond endurance.
79412|1|Its tight cross-lacing of paranoid dreaming and poetic realism grips like a bondage corset.
77856|0|An uneven film and overlong, but not without some merit.
71053|0|The interesting insights give way to undercover constables, and gut-spilling villains
7151|1|A kitsch cult classic.
83188|1|Jacques Becker, who did such a fine job in painting the turn-of-the-century apache milieu in Casque D'Or, brings the same care and psychological overtones to a film on the modern racketeer element.
26264|1|The Odd Couple meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Fairly fresh and fun, if ultimately fleeting entertainment.
76117|0|It's hard to say who might enjoy this, are there Tolstoy groupies out there? It's dark and tragic, and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death
24496|1|Sylvester Stallone's follow-up to his runaway success of 1976 is a little more threadbare in spots than the original, but it still has some conviction and spunk.
51984|0|The astonishing Richard Harris can't overcome the underwhelming narrative. A rare misfire from Jim Sheridan.
65839|1|...a damning indictment of one of the world's dirtiest open secrets.
8976|1|"The true magic is in the ""Trolley Song"" sequence, one of American musical film's finest moments"
6779|0|Too serious to be a comedy, too flippant to be a thriller, it often feels like a backhanded act of penance for the misogynist humor in the star's comedy act.
58307|0|A god awful violent fantasy that glorifies the lifestyle.
19583|1|Driving Miss Daisy spans a quarter-century in the intricate relationship of a Southern dowager and her chauffeur, and it is a movie that invites you to appreciate the passage of time in more than one way.
45379|0|It's Larry Clark who's the bully, a cinematic bovver boy who just can't help himself.
38773|1|A guaranteed howl.
33451|0|For a film with a pre-established conclusion, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me seems depressingly interminable.
37977|1|The most brilliant of all Soviet silent films.
45524|0|It's that grab for political significance that does Apartment Zero in -- that turns what might have been a modestly successful psychological thriller into a messily failed art film.
39336|0|A leaden, somber and suspenseless thriller.
64467|1|While equally paying homage to directors Peckinpah, Eastwood, and Kurosawa, what makes Open Range special is that it's a love story, too. And one peopled by endearing characters we're inclined to care about when the bloodletting has finally ended.
37564|1|While no means a masterpiece, it's a Stephen King film worthy of viewing once or twice...
16579|1|The only trouble with this documentary is not in telling people what it's about, but rather trying to figure out if there's anything that it's not about.
81168|0|Even as the darkness closes in, there is never any real sense of dread. The slow-burning terror soon fizzles out, as does the damp squib of an ending.
75588|1|Stiller is in fine form and just watching his exaggerated, paranoid egocentric White is amusing in itself.
68742|1|The movie is today noted chiefly for its legendary climactic episode: a harrowingly realistic sequence in which the hero hurdles a succession of floating ice blocks to save the heroine from being washed over the falls.
54285|0|For losers
95350|1|What works, wonderfully, are the falls, the punch-outs (his brawls with Stepdad are brutal throw-downs) and waiting for that next accident to happen.
82788|0|An utterly embarrassing misfire with poor performances, contrived elements, and a weak premise.
64300|1|Not quite good enough to jump out of the pack of Asian swordplay movies but is too well crafted to sink into utter anonymity.
100303|0|This is better than the dull Edward Norton vehicle The Illusionist, all involved should have conjured up a companion piece to Christopher Nolan's The Prestige.
7595|0|The picture that will test the durability of Leslie Nielsen's lowbrow franchise, Spy Hard sticks closely to the Naked Gun formula. Not only is the formula itself wearing thin, but the gags themselves feel recycled.
44308|0|A techno thriller that suffers from narrative shortcomings but is elevated by the star power of John Travolta and Halle Berry and particularly Aussie actor Hugh Jackman who's bound to become a Hollywood star.
32124|1|Thanks to Morton's presence, it gets closer to the sweetness of the wonderful Everyone Says I Love You.
72132|1|Emotional and engaging, The Wrestler is a masterful piece of work that deserves every award the Academy can throw at it.
80379|0|Another of Cassavetes' puzzling, personal, neurotic, and often brilliant productions that would have benefited from editing with a scythe.
93679|1|Apted directs with a firm hand and the film has been gorgeously shot by Remi Adefarasin. The large cast is generally good, with Gruffudd serving as the strong anchor.
64449|0|"Viewing the earthbound sequences in ""Grind"" is like watching the dialogue portions of pornos. Pity the viewers who catch this one without the benefit of a fast-forward or chapter select button."
39378|1|Easily the best film on Crowe's already impressive roster.
92492|0|There are fragments of good comedy packed amidst the many forgettable scenes that you've seen a dozen times before in a dozen other forgettable comedies
55356|1|This classic satire on the dehumanization of industrial workers is one of Rene Clair's greatest achievements.
40978|1|Pleasant movie despite some predictability.
58057|1|The generic standard of the super-teacher is only one piece of a larger, more satisfying story that runs counter to the overblown optimism of films like Dead Poets Society.
68710|1|See Errol Flynn in Robin Hood  and then see Kaye in Court Jester. The former is the ultimate swashbuckler; the latter the ultimate swashbuckler spoof.
7526|1|"""Cemetery Man"" (1994) is a quirky blend of romance, lust, surrealism, horror, and black comedy which transcends the work of better-known Italian horror maestros like Dario Argento thanks to its grotesquely humorous bent."
27926|1|A picture-perfect summer romance!
14710|0|Yet another 'buddy' or 'Odd Couple' cop movie that isn't particularly groundbreaking or memorable.
87423|1|...an endearing tribute to a justly popular country singer.
56135|0|It is fabulously badly made, with rare weak performances from otherwise excellent actors ... and idiotic dialogue and events.
21479|0|Steve Buscemi's invigorating vocal characterization of Templeton the rat is the only high point in this sleep-inducing live action-animated revamp of the 1973 animated classic based on E.B White's 1952 children's book.
101017|0|Yet there's still enough to hold the attention - the actual Apollo equipment has the ring of authenticity - and it's worth taking the trip just to gawp at the sheer beauty of the programmer's art.
64695|1|A funky, wonky, and entertaining jolt into the decade that bred free loving, hipster rockers, and hippies...
66707|1|The film births wonderful performances from all three lead actors, as well as Marcia Gay Harden, who's palpable in preternatural ways, Thomas Guiry as the boy in love with Jimmy's daughter, and virtually everyone else with a strip of film time.
3579|1|I love this film. It's a story about hope and dreams and one whose emotional impact is as great as the Pacific Ocean is blue.
44542|0|Plays as little more than a dated potboiler for all its backdrop of impending chaos and wrenching change.
50000|1|Crowe asks the viewer to absorb this more viscerally than intellectually; how much one enjoys (or even accepts) the experience will likely depend on the extent to which one is willing to do so.
32133|0|The movie can never muster up the courage to take itself seriously.
50355|0|Leaps into an unconvincing situation and sees it with an unsure point of view
75475|0|I was once again stuck watching a movie that's solely about repressed passion, perhaps the least cinematic thing you could ever try to film.
39798|1|Too campily amusing not to like.
40357|1|After struggling with a few films to find the right vibe and tone for a Bond film, DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER finds a nice balance that would work for a while.
98309|0|To put it bluntly, this trip isn't worth taking for the vast majority of movie-goers.
100812|1|Sounds predictable and academic, but what's unexpected is how deftly Stiller manages to explore these issues and allude to war films from The Bridge on the River Kwai to Platoon to Rambo while still recognizing the value of a well-placed fart joke.
17948|1|Renee Zellweger, previously best known as the sweet mom from 'Jerry Maguire,' delivers a quietly stunning performance in the lead.
77648|0|The Forgotten, though not an outright bad movie, is yet another frustrating example of a Hollywood film that simply lacks the courage of its convictions.
71045|1|Wraps itself around Bettany's guilty secrets like a hot-water bottle, leaving more interesting characters in the moral cold
100543|0|It pains me to say it, but as far as I can see it's an extended and slightly better crafted example of those fake 'reality TV' shows.
20215|1|1989's middle entry, in which the pair head forward to 2015, is the most underrated -- like fellow second child Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, it had to contend with doltish charges of being too cold.
1782|0|"""Smoke"" follow-up lacks the first flick's spark and humor."
11155|1|One of Ferrara's more bearable fims. Solid performances.
70773|1|This sublime picture is directed by Robert Bresson, who painstakingly crafts his signature visuals -- stark, forceful and rigorous in their attention to detail -- to bring a striking luminosity to the bleak events.
10966|0|After the first hour or so of The Doors, the only door I wanted to see was the one marked ''EXIT.''
1269|1|The humor is up to Muppet par, with physical comedy, puns, running jokes, and layered gags...Muppet Treasure Island is grand family entertainment. [new DVD review]
52182|0|Unhappily, the story didn't need to get this involved and it winds up constantly trying to pull the picture apart, working against the comedy.
22205|0|Under Capricorn is overlong and talky, with scant measure of the Alfred Hitchcock thriller tricks.
11849|0|Almodovar's polarities are so perfectly lined up in opposition to my own that it is quite possible for one of his movies to shoot right through my brain without striking a single cell.
33870|1|Ben Younger, who not only wrote and directed this film, but plays a minor part as one of the traders, has crafted an intense thriller about this often risky business.
33925|1|Fast-paced and friendly enough to satisfy.
8929|1|The Maltese Falcon is among the most important and influential movies to emerge from the Hollywood system -- as significant in some ways as its contemporary, Citizen Kane.
24632|1|Macchio rises above the trite script to deliver a sympathetic and believable performance. Morita is equally good value and look out, too, for Elisabeth Shue in an early role.
26074|0|The film quickly falls apart amid chaotic plotting and stiff acting.
5168|1|Cruise at the top of his game
77944|0|There's not much happening even when the viewer eventually gets around the bend.
12956|1|Beineix choreographs the actors and the camera into a stunning and stylish cinematic dance... This is not a musical in the strict sense of the word but it certainly feels like one in the way it moves.
15928|0|... incrível como um filme que suga tantos elementos de clássicos como 2001, Alien e Solaris pode ter resultado em uma besteira tão grande. Mas é este o talento de Anderson: dirigir besteiras colossais.
69996|0|The only points of interest for some of us in this phoned-in film are the Toronto locations.
42425|1|This is the kind of film we would all like to make, if we were very old and very serene. There were times when I felt uncannily as if Kurosawa were filming his own graceful decline into the night.
63391|1|A sharp, funny shot at people taking their luxe life too seriously.
49457|1|Calling The Devil's Backbone a ghost story is an unfair simplification of an exquisitely crafted film... If you must label this film as horror, then it's a horror film with a soul.
92733|0|If only all the production elements added up to great movie. Instead, they seem like window dressing on a sill looking out to nowhere.
61244|1|This is Noir deconstructed - taking the witty, world-weary cynics for which Bogart is known and shining a light on their erratic tendencies.
2232|1|The cold war gets hot in this nuclear disaster film.
43103|1|I wanted them to visit for awhile longer.
92966|1|Una comedia dramática agridulce donde brilla con luz propia el formidable Peter O'Toole, en un papel que tiene mucho de sí mismo.
4662|0|There is nothing terribly different or exciting about what he shows us; the film is gripping in a conventional, formulaic way.
41182|1|One of the year's most visually stylistic films.
1040|1|It's a first-class, stylish farce with a brisk pace and cool wit.
29504|1|An action movie with a conscience.
23170|0|Other Altman films prove that the director knew how to be elliptical without being presumptuous or overly disjointed. Nashville serves as an unfortunate counterexample.
89180|1|At the center of it all is lovely little Nortier, an untrained actress who never made another film, wearing her odd pigtails and giving a heartbreakingly wounded performance.
46477|0|Does it matter to Eddie Murphy whether Harlem Nights is good or bad? It doesn't look like it.
86399|1|The master is back, with this remarkably accessible tale of anger and revenge.
83701|1|Estamos ante una historia interesante, en la que los personajes dejan de ser las caricaturas habituales de siempre para convertirse en seres humanos reales.
83290|1|Andrew Horn's film charts Nomi's remarkable rise, his brief cult fame and his untimely flameout in 1983 as one of the arts community's earliest AIDS fatalities.
3355|1|The talk is dirty and funny, the violence always waiting just around the corner.
3889|0|"Unlike famous bumbling sleuths such as Inspector Clouseau and Lt. Frank Drebin, there's no consistency to the ""Ace"" character, and the whole movie shifts in tone from social satire to sophomoric pranks and traditional copshow plotting."
32974|1|Respects the character...and winningly combines personal drama and clever themes with intrigue and action to tell a story in keeping with Batman's classic comic adventures.
33908|1|Though the comedy often goes flat, Peet busts loose in a terrific comic performance, while the icily beautiful Henstridge adds class.
2820|1|Taken solely as a pop wedge of cheese, it's beautifully realized. As for the empty-headed dialogue and the puerile plot, isn't it obvious those are both part of the point?
43291|1|...[Ridley] Scott's most entertaining and involving effort since 2001's Black Hawk Down.
76096|1|It's not just Joan's campiness -- her line readings take on an almost incantatory quality -- but the way the whole thing feels like a stealth therapy session for smart actors trapped in horse-opera stereotypes.
80281|1|Brooks at his most brilliant!
86162|1|[Pucci] has an extremely unusual face, which, in addition to bearing a strong resemblance to Tilda Swinton, allows him to carry off both deadpan comedy and serious moments with equal aplomb.
64787|1|Despite more than a suspicion of palaver, it generates a fair portion of interest and climactic excitement ...
54228|0|Arnold's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces.
25216|1|The people who made Ruthless People probably expect us to laugh... at the pushy people who populate their story. And they're right: We will laugh -- not because we have lousy taste (and wicked thoughts) ourselves, but because their film is genuinely funny.
48406|1|When Worlds Collide is sincere, but doesn't take itself too seriously.
4067|0|While the story of Cobb himself is a worthy one (Shelton's treatment, believe it or not, even has its similarities to Orson Welles' Citizen Kane), Shelton shortchanges the very game that made the man famous.
33022|0|The movie needs to evoke more than the ghost of Genet to give it resonance.
78033|0|...menopausal drama full of hot flashes and preposterous plot turns. P.S., Linney overacts too.
27365|1|Another challenging movie bt John Sayles about the complexity of the soul and the mystery of fate.
3891|0|Neither terrible, boring nor soporific, just not very funny.
73164|1|One of the great American films from arguably the finest decade in American filmmaking.
50889|1|Wholly un-groundbreaking, deeply conservative, increasingly sentimental, but reflecting some of the best of those qualities.
61378|1|Click to read review
36345|0|In the end, the strengths of the movie are overwhelmed by what is pretentious, unplugged and boring to boot.
44628|1|"An unsettling sci-fi fairytale mélange of ""Pinocchio"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"" that's elegantly written, visually opulent and thematically challenging and discontented. One of Steven Spielberg's finest, and most fiercely misread, films."
65917|1|Shot on 100 locations in three countries and outfitted with impressive props, costumes, art direction and medieval streets, Luther makes up for what it lacks in vigorous storytelling with such production values.
51210|1|McBeth's personal karmageddon builds with comedy and tragedy in equal measure, without being as long as the original.
22558|1|Hunter and Brooks are hugely appealing as news professionals trying to stay afloat in the corporate cauldron.
52133|1|A film that at once disturbingly deconstructs human behavior in an almost clinical -- and bitterly comic -- manner, while evidencing great warmth and fondness for its benighted characters.
23711|1|Every character is booked through to hell or purgatory. But we gasp at the inventiveness, ferocity and cuckoo anarchy with which these rockers prepared their route to destruction or damnation.
62021|1|There's nothing particularly original about the plotline, but the execution is pretty good and may be enough to keep you in your seat.
82511|1|Binder's writing is matched by the top-notch talents on display here.
85830|1|Werner Herzog forgoes judging Timothy Treadwell's disputed methods or questionable mental state - letting viewers decide based on footage that suggests Treadwell essentially sought some sort of transmutation from flesh to fur.
80437|1|A tour-de-force thriller from Hyams and Douglas... its final moments are as gripping as Superglue!
66577|1|Although things like character development are sometimes lost in the crossfire, the lead actors have enough charm to sustain the film.
90509|0|The movie could have been recorded on 8mm film with no audio and the intended audience would most likely be content.
87247|0|It isn't exactly All Quiet on the Western Front or Oh! What a Lovely War. What it lacks is proper finesse.
18804|1|The characters all seem to have known each other for years, referring to long-held grudges and resentments that only gradually are revealed to the audience. They're a seedy, petty, dangerous and delightful bunch.
12916|1|M is responsible for some of the most memorable images and sequences in cinema history
21839|0|An understandably tired-looking Leslie Nielsen should seriously consider retirement from this tired genre.
55693|0|A lukewarm live-action Loony Tunes cartoon.
11330|0|If you are a fan of the original film, this remake might interest you. It's not badly made. But why was it made at all?
27632|0|Although we cannot take our eyes off Ms. Balibar, whose performance is remarkable in its understated range of emotion, she is the only character with whom we can connect.
85559|1|There are enough characters in the clean cut satire 'Sky High' to spin-off a dozen Saturday morning TV series.
28740|1|It may be little more than an expensive arcade game for overgrown kids, but it moves too fast for critical flak to stick.
18546|0|The plot isn't merely stupid, but heartless; viewers aren't given a single reason to watch beyond the anticipation of seeing Farley fall off more scenery.
70472|0|Writer-director C. Jay Cox has created a tender gay love story, and then buries it under shrill diatribes, plot clichés and one-note characters.
60835|1|Thanks Sidney.
53851|0|Perhaps if I had experienced this movie when I was twelve years old, I'd have come away with something more than a lot of yawns and the desire to plant a tree.
86471|0|What a disappointment! The greatest fantasy novels and films are products of the unconscious - they have the authority of visions, glimpsed though imperfectly understood. But the creators of MirrorMask remain all too wide awake.
58782|1|"The plot is a little of ""Fatal Attraction,"" a little of ""Jagged Edge"" and a little of ""Wall Street."" It works because it's so audacious in combining elements that don't seem to belong together."
62420|1|A spectacular comedy-adventure that's never less than totally immersive. Not quite the masterpiece that Toy Story was, but it's the closest Pixar have come since.
37172|1|A good old-fashioned Nazi ass-whomping, aided by some great effects and a charming pair of heroes.
57927|0|Truly disappointing sequel to Rocky Horror
51941|0|They failed to get a consistently funny script or a director capable of effectively staging an action scene.
35553|0|One of Spielberg's rare and true misfires. It's weirdly creepy when it's not being bombastically boring.
82605|1|Spectaculat spectacle. Lame drama. Interesting early James Whale
63095|0|Is it too late to vote them off? For once, we don't have to tell you how bad a film is... you knew before they made it.
68082|1|...it's easy enough to suspend one's disbelief thanks primarily to the film's brisk pace and Broderick's exceedingly ingratiating performance.
41073|0|The film is beautifully photographed like a Hallmark tourist postcard...
48596|0|The first half-hour is powerful stuff, but after Brubaker reveals his true identity, the movie begins to falter, with the one-dimensional nature of the characters (particularly the warden himself) eventually stripping the story of any dramatic charge.
19190|1|It still makes one of the strongest statements about alcoholism, though time has taken away some of its edge.
75633|1|There's a timeless quality about 'Dear Frankie.' This touching film tugs at your hearstrings and won't let go, even after the end credits roll.
12862|1|Duck Soup should make practically everybody laugh.
61578|1|Guest lets the characters talk at length, obliviously revealing their own quirks and neuroses.
98382|1|[The filmmakers] capture the whimsy of Seuss' drawings and add a nice tactile feel.
87047|1|It is as if Pasolini has imagined how Italy's bland, complacent, stagnant governing class could be blown wide open: like putting a hundredweight of dynamite in the San Andreas fault.
41241|1|Annie is a happy--go lucky musical with a happy ending.
14938|0|A disaster--and not the kind that's fun to watch, either.
64194|0|This saga dulls your senses as it weaves across the globe.
24830|1|A legal drama that doesn't follow the usual Hollywood-John Grisham formula.
35828|1|Me, Myself, and Irene reunites comedian Jim Carrey with directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly, and they're all in top form.
29685|1|A moody five-finger exercise about loss with a terrific performance by Terence Stamp.
51292|0|I never looked at my watch so often during a movie.
34423|1|Rogue's Gallery noir classic.
81440|1|With this beautiful, thought-provoking, adrenaline-fuelled film, Oshii heralds a truly post-human era in which all forms of 'life' deserve our respect.
64041|1|It has many delightfully absurd moments in which Jack Lemmon and Brit actress Juliet Mills thoroughly exploit to the fullest.
62784|0|...typical of John Wayne's war films: heroic, nationalistic, patriotic, sentimental, and hokey.
53962|0|Fails to ignite in the way a film -- even a comedy -- revolving around Napoleon should.
16328|0|Proof that Hollywood no longer knows how to make that former staple, the women's picture.
19393|1|An impressive and enduring evocation of time and place, this is a moving low-life drama built around Oscar-winning writing and performances.
35021|0|...an uneven, needlessly episodic adaptation that simply isn't able to justify its feature-length running time.
6305|1|Only the deliciously demented imagination of Edward Scissorhands director Tim Burton could have come up with such a dark vision of the holiday season.
28674|1|Middling thriller. Drags to say the least.
30926|0|Tied together with some humdrum animated sequences, three vignettes on offer obviously were produced on the absolute cheap, and are deficient in imagination and scare quotient.
20949|0|PJ Hogan's lazy, logy Peter Pan states that not growing up is a tragedy, but presents neither evidence nor arguments.
58245|1|A charming but slight comedy.
21484|1|Hardly the equal of Babe but the superior voice cast and Fanning's unforced charm make for another film that'll put you off pork forever.
68020|1|A classic that is beautifully restored to life, successfully mixing lightness and humour in a dark film that would even have Frankenstein's monster running for cover.
21096|1|Splash is a light-hearted comedy directed by Ron Howard that sparkles here and there thanks to its fairy tale elements.
95779|1|...pretty standard mean-girls stuff, made enjoyable by the deft casting of Bynes...
57951|1|The first Weismuller Tarzan and still one of the best.
25267|0|The film often soars into the imaginary heavens of delight but then just as quickly sputters and crash lands due to Coppola's leaden helming.
2893|0|I just did not buy Oldman as Beethoven. I thought he was miscast, and he certainly overacted.
43471|0|The time may finally be ripe to leave the bloodsuckers to their coffins and move on to less familiar terrors.
75579|0|A film whose pacing gives new meaning to the term 'sluggish,' and actually makes the charismatic Owen seem boring.
30628|1|So-so '70s Bond entry has sex, drugs, action violence.
48579|1|For a good, healthy PG-13 scare, Boogeyman is fun for the whole family -- just don't bring kids who are too young.
68461|0|You have to put up with a plot that's so sticky it doesn't fly.
73559|1|Full of chases, near captures, sword fights, and epic battles, as well as plenty of humor, both of the slapstick and wordplay varieties.
39128|1|By Tennessee Williams' standards, the text is trashy and overwroght, but at the time, homosexuality and cannibalism stirred such a controversy that the movie became one of the playwright's most successful Hollywood adaptations.
95456|0|Horror/thriller/pile of excrement.
55019|0|The very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary.
95421|0|Skinwalkers is never able to escape its fundamental preposterousness. You've seen worse, but, trust me, you've seen better.
35548|0|With all the money and talent and hype that went into this film, it should have been a lot better, but it is entertaining enough to rate a passing grade, especially for Robin Williams fans.
25143|0|Inevitably, given a bigger budget, it lacks the cheap, raw quality of the earlier film that, along with George Romero's outfit in Pennsylvania, showed you could make profitable exploitation shockers on an independent basis far from Hollywood.
86713|1|Relentless in its condemnation of childish parenting and irresponsibility, Noah Baumbach's uncomfortable The Squid and the Whale ranks as one of 2005's best films by pulling no punches whatsoever.
13745|1|Whale added an element of playful sexuality to this version, casting the proceedings in a bizarre visual framework that makes this film a good deal more surreal than the original.
7806|0|[A] hilariously inscrutable exercise in pseudo-profundity.
23041|1|Though the story is standard formula kids' fare, the Allen presence brings an adult swing to it, making it more than passable for both.
66411|0|"If you like your movies described as ""quirky"" and ""kinda weird"", here's a not-awful dark comedy that at the very least, offers one enjoyably bizarre cast."
73741|1|Huston's Wise Blood is a sharp, busy canvas that, like a man with a good car, doesn't need to be justified.
96809|1|The film is really at its best when it's dealing with the dysfunctional father-daughter relationship. Douglas and Wood's believable character dynamic certainly helps.
55089|0|Some diverting cameos, but Murphy struggles to keep this one grounded.
21597|1|This funny, unpretentious film marked writer John Hughes's first time out as a director. The premise is ordinary, but the film is distinguished by funny gags and excellent performances.
76706|1|Some memorable performances don't quite make Jean Brodie feel like real cinema.
41465|0|By the time the uninspiring finale occurs the audience is completely lost in boredom and longing for the credits.
78602|0|"This is ultimately ""Alexander"" as written by Danielle Steele..."
5879|0|The trouble with The Ref is that it keeps running out of steam, so it seems to develop a new plot wrinkle every seven minutes. Typically, it'll run through the new idea until it runs out of steam again, then invents yet another one.
7203|1|Cute and relatively inoffensive. At times, even funny.
37355|1|A remarkably assured debut for Coen.
68178|1|Great new classic western.
20081|0|As action-adventure, it's pointlessly puerile, a movie where the heroes are so childish they try to one-up each other with fancy shots at the pistol range.
91907|1|Oozes hardly more than body fluids in its telling tale.
65270|0|Once Upon a Time in the Midlands has great comic potential but misses the mark.
37045|0|"The ""Bond In Space"" angle is all we need to write Moonraker off as daft, but... the whole script is a messy disaster."
13777|1|The Candyman is a svelte, sexual monument, far removed from the silent brutality of your average serial slasher.
100415|1|It is an outstandingly intelligent, formally pleasing film, and a fascinating development for Breillat herself.
5627|0|quickly becomes as monotonous as bluenoses accuse it of being prurient
30344|0|...it's hard now to see what all the fuss was about.
47550|0|...the most anti-human movie to surface since Showgirls.
16146|1|Petersen, known for the efficient and vigorously muscular action of Das Boot and In the Line of Fire, once again directs with galvanizing intensity, but the relentlessness of these thrills carries little in the way of surprise.
25187|0|For those who saw the first two Massacres, this will seem pretty much deja-boo!
41579|1|Brash, crude and very funny.
81612|1|Guy Maddin's snow globe cinema, hermetically sealed in ghostly adoration of silent cinema, is well matched to this darkly comic fable.
57193|0|For curious completists only.
40275|1|Stirring story--may be appropriate for some teens.
48699|1|Sometimes it's nice to sit back and enjoy the fireworks, and this movie has lots of fireworks.
61274|0|Never for a minute do we think Burt Reynolds might be guilty, and even harder to swallow is that he and Russell could even like each other, much less become lovers.
39188|0|Sun Tzu believed that becoming predictable would lead to disaster. Apparently, the creators of The Art of War couldn't be bothered to take him to heart.
67366|0|Seldom have we seen such an extensive ensemble of talent in the movies yanked through the material like lambs on their way to a slaughter.
67008|1|Enchanting.
3980|1|Having figured out how to make a Jack Ryan action thriller with Patriot Games, the same cluster of filmmakers got to do it again... managing to improve virtually across the board.
10204|1|A work of both learned, assured poise and triumphant freshman determination, not far away from other benchmark-status works like Snow White or Pixar's Toy Story.
29158|0|I'm all for romance, you understand. But what makes this a drawback is that these people are all wrong for each other and that the filmmakers don't seem to know it.
13208|0|Unfortunately, Jarmusch's lackadaisical minimalist aesthetic and his chronic lack of energy are the only unifying elements.
9153|0|There is little here to attract anyone but the core fan-base.
14158|1|The humanity of the Star Trek series, unexpected as it is in a sci-fi setting, remains the series' best feature.
31112|1|James Cagney is simply great as the captain of the ship.
67225|0|This is such a smug, self-satisfied film that it will leave a bad taste in your mouth, whether you're a fan of old melodramas or not.
5930|1|The flaws don't cripple what is a fiercely funny, exciting and provocative detective story about the crimes of corporate culture -- crimes that transcend race and geography.
50822|1|This is still watchable for the verve of the ensemble acting and dovetailing direction, but some of the crassness leaves a sour aftertaste.
45682|1|Not only a great comedic effort but Eddie Murphy's best romantic film as well.
70363|0|...if children can stay awake long enough, they will undoubtedly find much of it entertaining.
30723|1|A surrealistic ride into a fantasy world that is unique and never before seen.
32106|0|The fairly simple storyline...is certainly stretched quite thin over the two hour running time.
19757|0|Friday the 13th Part 2 never aspires to be termite art.
39566|1|Kudos to Guest and friends for a funny and insightful film.
60650|1|Suffice it to say this is a delightful, uplifting treat, whether you like soccer or not (and I don't).
82883|1|Even with [Rocco's] undeniable excess, the climactic moments transcend style and are profoundly moving.
10506|1|Warmhearted, original, but not entirely successful tribute to classic Hollywood movies of the 1930s, specifically Capra's You Can't Take It With You.
16987|1|Bonham Carter never allows the audience to lose the feeling that Kate truly does care about Milly--it's just that she cares about herself even more.
51269|1|As an essay on cinematic language, Don't Look Now is ingenious ... As a work of storytelling, Don't Look Now isn't as clean-cut.
63594|0|A myopic, histrionic picture that never lets us know why this legendary character is legendary, and worthy of our attention.
48052|0|The best parts of this dud are the ones in which she's singing. This is what she does best. This is what she should stick to. Save your money and watch her videos for free on cable music-television networks.
14536|0|A sequel no one wanted, done about as poorly as possible
65032|1|Earth may be the most striking collection of nature photography I've ever seen. It isn't flawless, but it is a one-of-a-kind treat.
61021|1|Brilliant romantic comedy from Leo McCarey
52404|1|[A] half-forgotten little curio for later generations to study with puzzled delight.
83464|0|Once the effect of the second act's gimmick wears off, you find yourself growing more and more annoyed at the improbability of the entire setup.
48941|0|"Cage is believable as the brooding lone-wolf gunman, but the ""hit man screwing himself by growing a conscience on his final kill"" ploy needs to be put down for good."
9033|1|One of the best films out there, and certainly a high point in early cinema. The love for Citizen Kane is deserved.
7515|1|The borrowings from other movies, going all the way back to the car chase in 1968's Bullitt, are heavy. But Bay has three leads to lend weight and dimension to characters who are hardly original and flatly written.
39130|1|Very controversial for its time, and still packs a wallop.
56215|0|An occasionally amusing but completely disposable comedy of errors that's not nearly as funny as it thinks it is.
19306|1|If Tom Jones now feels something of a product of its times, it still deserves credit for attempting something new.
11937|1|Shall we re-wind and give it another spin? As you wish...
56718|1|Sluggishly paced but otherwise harmless drama about coming of age in South Korea.
1026|0|Despite great scenery, the distinctive visual ideas of Mr. Scott (Alien, Blade Runner) and the strong dramatic presence of Mr. Bridges, most of White Squall remains listless and tame.
48116|1|In a vivid portrait of one high school football season, Carlson gives us a snapshot of American values on parade.
58804|1|The most enjoyably awful of Madonna's awful movies.
3765|1|Malle adeptly eases us into the play so we can't tell at what precise moment Chekhov takes over, an ambiguity that becomes the film's triumph as well as its key limitation.
75611|1|It's the type of movie that would easily entertain any viewer.
26867|1|... a good choice for a family movie outing.
73400|1|...perfect synthesis of singing, dancing, comedy, and satire, a show that brought scintillating dialogue, sharp-edged lyrics, and catchy tunes into sharp focus.
68024|1|A perennially unsettling masterpiece from which modern chillers could learn much.
33504|1|Harsh, unflinching and sinfully enjoyable.
17919|0|A pretentious, preachy first movie from an arguably great filmmaker.
70752|1|A mystery at heart, about identity, fatherhood, religion and how early transistor radios transformed young people's lives. On that level, it is utterly engrossing.
46563|1|A definite gateway title for blossoming horror fans.
17723|1|It's not the stunts and derring-do which excite the senses as much as the quiet chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson; that is guaranteed to get your blood up.
73748|0|Clive Barker is the Douglas Sirk of splatter.
51972|0|While it does beat watching paint dry, at least watching paint dry gives you a sense of something having been accomplished.
88570|0|Gentle enough to satisfy the wee ones but has little to offer their adult companions...
34878|1|Denzel Washington really comes into his own in this one, as a struggling jazz musician. Worth a rental for his performance, alone!
28177|1|Aside from all this surface nonsense, there's something interesting about the film (perhaps all the emphasis on eating and mouths).
17782|0|Hush will always find a place at sadists' film festivals.
30051|1|"One of those movies in which you ask yourself, ""So, who isn't in this movie?"" The answer? Not many."
49542|0|To make an uninvolving movie out of one of the most decisive battles of the Second World War may seem a dubious challenge, but there's no denying Universal their full credit in meeting it.
69939|0|This expensively empty action comedy is as much fun as a car crash.
82602|1|Jean Harlow's screen debut isn't much to look at, to be honest. The air battles, however, are another story.
41994|1|Les amateurs de films se basant avant tout sur le développement d'ambiances langoureuses seront conquis d'avance.
74199|0|Picturesquely soporific.
42491|0|Wile it's not quite as bad as the critics claimed upon its release, it's not particularly good either.
66838|1|April's cranberry sauce may be canned but the laughter and tears of an affecting, unsentimental coda are real.
78679|0|Get out the Game Boy instead.
39648|0|Any resemblence to Clive Barker's real work is purely coincidental.
8881|0|What's going on is sort of confused.
53766|1|Every little piece of this project fell magically, hilariously in place, even if some of its gags don't quite hit the target.
69338|0|This is fairy tale stuff, its saintly hip-hop heroine far too worthy for comfort and its dialogue hilariously banal.
43147|1|I guess the big surprise for me was in how well the murder mystery was crafted and so smoothly intertwined with the film's religious trappings.
75398|1|The bleakness and myriad cruelties of the prison system are telegraphed with a graceful touch.
34149|1|It's a bit somnolent, but the interactions between Whitaker and his mob bosses strike a few sparks.
4364|1|As Red Rock West reached its conclusion, I was completely caught up in its plot -- and unsure of what would happen next. That's rare in a thriller, and it's a tribute to the ingenuity, skill and craft of the people on both sides of the camera.
61660|1|The script is full of witty dialogue and simple yet complex situations.
44065|1|Colorful and rousing.
21338|1|An affable film that helped affirm Drew Barrymore's place in the Hollywood firmament as something cosier than a one-trick wild child.
35262|1|Perhaps the highlight of Chaplin's late career
20204|1|This futuristic thriller just seems to keep getting better with age. An entertaining sci-fi flick done before special effects took over the genre.
85443|1|An involving and fun tale of redemption with many fine musical moments as well an enjoyable subplot involving the rotund Key and his understandably skeptical wife.
62614|1|The Duke knows by instinct what audiences accept without question: whatever he may be called in the script, he is always unmistakably John Wayne. And who would have it any other way?
2063|1|There really are some kids who think like this, and these are the kids who should see this film
64846|0|The plot, needless to say, is negligible.
3608|1|Brilliantly implicit, relentlessly paced, hilariously dark and underpinned by a central moral dilemma guaranteed to tease long after lights out.
83491|1|A film where special effects erase physics and the constraints of the human body, there's absolutely no telling what will come next.
13382|1|So-so storyline, but Mary Stuart Masterson rocks!
73796|0|well-shot, but it is the only good thing that could be said about KEN PARK
18188|0|Stinks
61575|1|Hilarious folk music mockumentary has some innuendo.
86445|0|The producers were more compelled to flash us than provide a story that wasn't contrived or incredibly far-fetched...
68899|1|An anarchic parody of college life.
64230|1|Refuses to chuck us under our chins and tell us everything is OK.
81549|1|Puts a tense, deteriorating marriage on a highway-bound collision course with a killer.
60333|0|Subplots fizzle out and plausibility dwindles (a thirtysomething college dean?), but at least there are no de rigueur fart, burp or scatological jokes.
59529|0|...so dependent on plot contrivances and so altogether preposterous, it seems an unfortunate waste of Pacino's and Farrell's acting talents.
71280|0|If Bill Macy shoots blanks, you've got a dud.
42745|1|Fun, if not cookie-cutter, Agatha Christie-based flick w/Peter Ustinov fine as Det. Hercule Poirot.
43467|0|Some movies don't need to be analyzed, just watched. This is not one of those movies because it didn't entertain me. It bored me, and when I am bored I get cranky.
68041|0|This is the kind of movie that is so witlessly generic that the plot and title disappear into a mist of other recycled plots and interchangeable titles.
5308|1|A good deal of the fun is noting the film and/or television allusions and/or rip-offs.
68492|1|...it was Cagney's film from beginning to end, to win or to lose, and he came out one of the biggest winners in Hollywood.
63355|0|A laid-back look at youthful rootlessness which never really catches fire.
90745|1|One of those animated features you can enjoy even without a kid by your side.
23263|1|In this follow-up to the amazing Eraserhead, David Lynch exposes undercurrents of anguish along with an emotionally accessible tale of Merrick's nobility--a Victorian morality play disguised as an elegy to freakishness
34785|1|If an uneasy mix of humour and sadness never quite gels, its message is clear and its cast uniformly strong.
15056|1|Alfonso Cuaron stages some terrific set-pieces, and the production designers deserve credit for making London in 2027 look like the grunge capital of the world, ie, like now, only more so. One small problem: I didn't believe any of it.
82686|1|Sigourney Weaver stands out as the heart of Imaginary Heroes, a depiction of a troubled suburban family.
21884|0|The character of Beetlejuice is hazy because the writers can never decide if he's a villain or an anti-hero...
76963|0|Toy tiaras for orphans! (the first one's always free)...Another day, another dollar for Disney's lucrative business of breeding...ever-longing dream princesses.
40754|1|If you think you're unshockable, see this film and then see what you think.
52151|0|An entire movie based on a verbal punchline
74452|1|A masterpiece from Mizoguchi -- for its historical drama, its moving social and family themes and its marvellously moody ghost story.
26724|1|Mamet trusts in the intelligence of his audience
31278|0|The movie drops in on a crucial part of their lives, follows it for a few minutes and then jettisons to another episode. It's like watching 10 short stories.
43554|1|Ultimately a rewarding -- if weird -- experience. It's just too bad that it takes so long to get there.
97898|0|This insipid, staggeringly dumb entry from New Line stoops to unprecedented new lows likely to stun even the most jaded cynic.
27240|1|Nutty, scary and fun
2608|1|On the level of pure craft, Disclosure is first-rate in every department. Levinson's directing is cogent and colorful, and cinematography by camera wizard Tony Pierce-Roberts is dazzling.
26591|1|Dark high school comedy is best for older teens.
91324|1|Funny, sad and horrifying. Anti-fundamentalist rather than anti-Christian, this deserves to preach to more than just the converted.
75748|1|It places the Marx Brothers clearly among the few fine comedians of our day.
97056|1|The brilliance of Southland Tales is inextricable from its flaws, if indeed they are flaws.
19897|0|This is one of those Identikit movies, assembled out of familiar parts from other, better movies.
71705|1|Bertuccelli tackles Since Otar Left... with the kind of ambitious imagination that makes one marvel at a natural filmmaker's unexpected and original choices.
91903|1|If you want to explore the ideas of love and emotional permeability while seeing a narratively complex world of sexual self-exploration to which few are privy, then this is the movie for you. Otherwise, run for your life.
84065|1|Realistic medical noir thriller.
6404|1|Searing story of adolescent anguish, almost unbearably painful.
58318|0|Unfortunately, Empire is nothing more than an exhausting retread of the same cliched urban cautionary tale that waxes about rebellion and redemption.
58929|1|An insightful, humanist masterwork.
28034|1|An enduring masterpiece...Truffaut's autobiographical fiction shows an admirable equanimity by depicting the highs and lows of boyhood. [Blu-ray]
46173|1|Here was a former Mr Universe [Arnold Schwarzenegger], by reputation one of the 'fittest' men in the world, looking as if walking normally is surprisingly hard work. Perhaps he really was acting after all.
80018|1|The film is by turns comic and profound, hysterical and pompous, fully complex enough to deserve more than a simple yea or nay.
18672|1|Solid, sexy drama with a dash of wit. Fine performances especially by Clarkson.
17023|1|This enchanting fairy-tale, the first release from Fox Animation Studios, is pure family entertainment.
66534|1|Love that Cagney!
46828|1|Campy fun
96494|0|With a cast like Phoenix, Ruffalo and Connelly, you know you're in for, at the very least, some compelling performances -- a fact that thankfully saves Reservation Road from utter banality.
90699|0|It ... has an insistently fussy and grandiose production design that mistakes lavish textures, brilliant colors and exotic backdrops for story atmosphere and style.
3082|0|Let's hear it for truth in advertising!
63911|1|Even hilarious today; politics haven't changed!
54081|1|A wonderfully colorful screen rendition of Joyce Cary's 1944 novel about an eccentric artist
42721|1|A slick and glossy thriller that still stands out.
88339|0|After two clean hits -- Knife in the Water and Repulsion -- Roman Polanski is entitled to one wild swing.
84185|1|Passable entertainment of the lightweight kind, providing several nice comic characters and scenes along the way.
10503|1|Winterbottom is angry, clear-headed, and with a sure visual sense.
32285|1|In technique, Diamonds is rather placid.
49672|1|A rambling, emotionally involving, and exuberent movie with flashes of cinematic poetry.
79343|1|One of John Ford's cavalry trilogy, and a near classic on its own. Wayne and Fonda are fine.
70128|1|Exquisite.
57527|0|It doesn't help that the director and cinematographer Stephen Kazmierski shoot on grungy video, giving the whole thing a dirty, tasteless feel.
69060|1|One of the best horror-thrillers of the classic era, and a massively inspirational piece of cinema.
10463|1|It's successful at holding our interest -- at making us care, and believe.
46943|0|Wes Craven creates Freddy Krueger. Again.
66875|0|A Hollywood product that exploits sickness.
53413|1|Coming-of-age tale for older kids and teens.
14731|1|I love the opening scenes of a wintry New York City in 1899. Cinematic poetry showcases the city's old-world charm before machines change nearly everything.
1239|1|A bigtime guilty pleasure for me.
66504|1|Parallels to today's global political environment and our government's new cold war loom as large as the icebergs surrounding the USS Bedford and its Soviet prey in the North Atlantic Sea.
73464|1|Junior Bonner, based on an excellent original screenplay by Jeb Rosebrook, is Peckinpah in the benignly comic mood that, I suspect, is much more the natural fashion of this fine director than is the gross, intellectualized mayhem.
25430|0|"Uneven ""ugly duckling"" teen flick."
67577|0|Regardless of all the ghosts, or maybe because of them, The Haunted Mansion is one lifeless, spiritless affair.
68326|1|Underrated.
82838|0|A conventional Cold War thriller whose flatness keeps it from being as suspenseful as it should be.
83748|1|It's about family.
97917|1|It's not that Hellboy II is a particularly bad sequel, but that it tries to do way too much in the time allotted.
94711|0|The best thing it has going for it is its look, which is stunning.
41043|0|This lightly engaging trifle could have been more fun with a greater helping of the Coens' antic spirit.
92769|1|Ali Selim's visual masterpiece recalls the stark artistry of Terrence Malick and Western lyricism of Larry McMurtry, as it turns every frame into a picture postcard of stunning beauty.
11206|1|Odd romantic journey for adults and older teens.
66374|0|Ginger Snaps finally represents nothing more than an overwhelming example of missed opportunity.
40942|0|Saddled with a wandering opening and an equally listless conclusion, a more fitting name for this two hour-plus biopic might well be Before Night Falters.
50160|0|Despite a promising premise, Jackman's Golden Globe-nominated performance remains the only tangible reason to see this movie.
10742|1|This fish is swimming with laugh-out-loud moments.
82349|1|The film manages something quite remarkable, both a compassion for Bicke's wounded sense of life's betrayals, and stark revulsion for the personal logic of his bloody remedy.
93328|1|When Hayek and Leto are onscreen, you do not look away.
8604|0|The Foxx-Farrell pairing can best be summed up by the first real Crockett-Tubbs scene in the film: on the rooftop of a club, on the phone... having separate conversations. The two share the frame and the on-set air but nothing else.
32962|1|The comedy captured the brutal realism of post-sexual-revolution high school life and has been imitated often, rarely equaled, and surpassed only once.
89401|0|It's hard to hate a movie that essentially just wants to teach kids to respect the environment especially when that lesson is imparted in such an upbeat manner. But Hoot is also too bland and clumsy to wholeheartedly embrace.
87057|1|I don't feel ready to write about this mysterious film; perhaps, a week from now, I'll decide it is very bad, a failure. But perhaps it is the most brilliant work yet by that strange director, Pier Paolo Pasolini.
83584|0|...a passion play with a guy in drag (who could ask for anything more?)...
288|0|An utterly lackluster production that most involved would be wise to keep out of their portfolios. The only director to come out of this mess looking good is Rodriguez.
59492|0|It'll leave you with a monster-rally headache and a craving for something salty.
41667|0|What's most disappointing here is that Kevin James appears capable of far more rich and subtle comedy than he's ever likely to be part of in a Happy Madison production.
5953|1|Cary Elwes is far more dashing and jubilant than either Kevin Costner or Russell Crowe, and he seems born for the role, rather than shoehorned into it.
54103|1|The second of John Ford's cavalry trilogy is well acted by John Wayne and well shot by Winton C. Hoch, who an Oscar for color cinematography.
60197|0|...a routine police thriller that is, for the most part, slow moving and uneventful.
3359|1|Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a Saturday Night Fever dream: a hot, dense, wicked disco of tough-guy posturings, vivid dips of violence and literally unbelievable plot moves.
85248|1|Some classic Marx bits make this a must-see.
89402|0|Hoot in retrospect won't really offer your children anything they haven't already seen, and it's just another preachy environmental film that talks down to them. Have you seen Akeelah and the Bee?
1695|0|You know you're in whole mess of trouble when the villains turn out to be more interesting than the hero.
58791|0|I'd rather eat my own liver than sit through this again
16257|1|The result is a powerful work of art. Seldom has a study of sleaze said more about what makes us all tick.
81403|1|One fascinating -- if not wholly accessible -- movie.
77049|0|Without a Paddle is two movies -- one good and one bad -- merged together into a cinematic hodgepodge of hilarity, originality, banality and absurdity.
67442|1|Lazin's documentary may be somewhat one-sided -- Afeni Shakur's involvement guaranteed that -- but it's still immensely enlightening, and a genuine gift to Tupac's fans.
87204|1|Very light, even saccharine at times, but blessed with enough pure charm to make the syrup go down a treat.
32937|1|In a career of poor choices, perhaps this one was the worst. Oh sure, it made money, but it also turned Emilio Estevez into Leslie Nielsen.
31172|1|Because Eddie doesn't have to carry the whole movie, he is free to make every word that comes out of his mouth infinitely appealing.
30348|1|Excellent, chilling classic with McCormack as perfect demon child.
12880|1|A unique, kooky gem.
9489|1|Sassy, screwball classic with a feminist twist.
33776|1|Flouncy, trouncy feel-good fun!
101357|1|A fun movie worth checking out.
60465|0|It's a pity that the plot culminates in a slew of melodramatic contrivances that leave a lot of strands hanging.
96544|1|As long as soldiers have gone into battle they have struggled with the rightness of their actions and their purpose in the field -- no matter how firm their resolve at the outset.
38768|0|Awkward combination of garish set decoration and muffled humor.
26176|0|The hokey dialogue and witless physical gags keep everything painful and hectoring.
42503|0|The most unintentionally hilarious biblical epic ever to grace the silver screen.
59234|1|The film sees Godard parsing out his feelings for Karina, then his wife, and meditating on the mercurial nature of his own preoccupations.
332|0|"Pity poor Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson: two gifted actors who must have rotten self-esteem. Why else would they choose to be in a turkey like ""Money Train""?"
64379|1|Even sentimentality is something that springs naturally from the characters' situations. Umberto has an immense amount of pride despite his impoverished conditions and his attempts to survive aren't accompanied by the usual filmic theatrics.
895|0|Kicking and Screaming feels as if it were callously vomited out by a machine, along with a couple of spare parts and some putrid grease.
5166|1|Adorning the film, in supporting roles, are its saving graces.
83403|1|The movie offers a loving but strikingly tempered assessment of family and town life that one seldom finds in today's raucous family films.
34002|1|It's so rare that I can't find anything to nitpick about in a movie.
48910|1|Barrymore is a wonder in this role.
29756|1|Suspenseful and supersexy.
58978|1|Max is also an intimate portrait of modern art; of the birth of the expressionist movement and great artists. . .
9497|1|"One of the best screwball comedies, a remake that improves on the source material due to Hawks brilliant idea of changing the protag's gender thus turning it into a romantic ""newspaper"" film; Cary Grant, Rosalind Russell, and Ralph Bellamy at their best"
73427|1|Fermented in a tragic romanticism placed firmly in a no-man's land between liberation and capitalism, Sam Peckinpah's 1974 thriller is a film that sticks in your mind's eye like a lingering sun spot.
18046|1|...an agreeable yet unremarkable piece of work.
72877|1|On Deadly Ground is a pip. Beautifully photographed by Ric Waite and handsomely produced, it surely is the most ambitious and the best Seagal movie to date.
23746|0|The film is caught somewhere between seriousness and cheesy exploitation.
67286|0|Zzzzzz.
30097|1|One of the best, if not the best Bond movie
6521|1|The special effects are a real treat, the love-beyond-the-grave theme is very touching and the ending is a wonderful piece of schmaltz.
53621|1|Stunning drama that cries out for death penalty reform...with excellent Susan Hayward in lead.
29136|0|You watch this movie for Lawrence's antics but soon realize he doesn't really involve the audience in his comedy, the way Murphy did in 48Hrs.
49213|1|A shrewdly timed reminder of Pixar's early, heady days, when the animation powerhouse could do no wrong.
60490|1|A terrific, thoroughly engrossing motion picture.
70126|1|One of the great San Francisco films.
86673|0|Aspires to be a story of redemption and discovery, but it's too undercooked to be either.
102578|1|This MGM prestige production, winner of the Original Story Oscar, features its top stars, Gable, William Powell and Myrna Loy.
33999|1|This performance shows Douglas aging gracefully and willingly, an accomplishment that only a couple of famous leading men have achieved in recent years.
12582|0|This is big empty turgid gunk, coming more from the brainless Transformers school than the Cameron Big Art Pop philoso-candy cloth.
20962|1|Peter Pan is so loaded with visual wonder that even when aspects of it fall short, it's gorgeous to behold.
74991|0|Riddick starts the way that all great storytelling should: with a voiceover by an old British woman.
98928|0|The comedy grows more and more gratingly cynical and unpleasant.
41178|1|The emotions of the piece are as palpable as the neverending snowfall.
2683|1|From the puns to the slapstick to the toilet, Dumb and Dumber is performed at such a high level that it transcends many of its influences.
10906|1|This is a modern classic and a personal exorcism for its director.
92335|0|Bale's wild-eyed menace keeps you watching for a time, but by the grisly end he's just another American psycho.
96643|1|Charming, funny and romantic.
59415|0|A bleak crime melodrama that is too complexly plotted for it own good.
35279|1|Lemmon excels in this small family project.
37853|1|Balls of Fury isn't quite as funny as it thinks it is, but there are some good gags and it's worth seeing for Christopher Walken's performance.
47305|1|It opens at fever pitch and then starts soaring -- into genetic fantasy, into a precognitive dream of delirium and delight.
23877|0|The film was too much stuck in its sentimentality and had an uninspiring and a contrived plot that kept me from warming up to the story.
39945|1|...a flawless endeavor that educates, intrigues and entertains all at the same time...
49919|0|Bratt's feline elegance, arrogance, and melancholy can't compensate for Ichaso's lack of restraint.
25144|0|Just needlessly ugly and unpleasant, not to mention Hollywoodized down to its muddy shoes.
19059|1|The case of the crew against the insane cruelty and avariciousness of Capt. Bligh is so powerfully presented that the injustice done to the men gets under one's skin to stir up a variety of emotion.
68474|1|Astaire and Rogers. Rogers and Astaire. Shall we just stop there?
49896|1|One of the best s-f flicks of the 1950s. A tragic story that is exciting and touching.
32518|1|Carnal Knowledge may seem dated, given its 1970s approach to this battle of the sexes. However, it paints a sadly accurate picture of the decidedly vicious attitude of many men to the realm of carnal desire.
58834|1|"This psychological thriller is penned by Ira Levin, of ""Rosemary's Baby"" fame..."
7788|1|A throwback to the disaster films of the 1970s, but on a global scale.
8637|1|Just sit back and enjoy romantic comedy at its most sublime.
96657|1|It's a pro-environmental apocalyptic shocker that works as a thinking man's ghost story pic.
78441|1|Apesar de contar com sua parcela de defeitos, merece aplausos pela honestidade com que aborda sua história e pela coragem de Glazer em investir em um ritmo lento e estudado.
85129|1|we won't be awarding points for originality, but sometimes the familiar can be just fine
74611|0|Puerile, gross and pandering to the lowest impulses of teenage boys.
64650|1|Worthy, challenging, heavily art-house-centric feature that explores ideas of immigration, communication, xenophobia and representations of reality within fiction.
64244|1|As summer shoot-'em-ups go, this is pretty well executed, with plenty of macho posing and gunfire.
64578|1|When [Muniz's] Cody gets close to a girl, there is an eager terror on his face and in his body language that hits the adolescence angst nail squarely on the head.
5797|1|What remains most striking about Philadelphia may be the...conspicuous emphasis on intense close-ups. They force an inescapable emotional intimacy in relation to issues the mainstream, at least at the time, would rather have looked away from. [Blu-ray]
57643|0|Harry Potter and his friends may soar through the air on broomsticks and dangle from flying cars, but the film itself never takes flight the way it ought to.
53148|0|A predictable and contrived, yet somewhat enjoyable film that was spoiled by the preview.
31312|1|This unusual French interpretation of Joan of Arc sees her as a radical zealot like John Brown.
21129|1|Perhaps one of the more stunning features in motion picture history, creatively adapting mistakes and hunting invention, shaping a movie that displays such curiosity with technology and boldness with sci-fi fantasy.
22039|1|Occupied the top spot on their Hitchcock chart in its time, but has since been usurped in the minds of contemporary critics by the filmmaker's later, slicker productions.
80133|1|Memorable for its lurid set-pieces (notably Robert Morley being forced to eat his own poodles), it also remains a favourite among critics; suggesting, perhaps, a certain guilty conscience. Punish us!
26510|1|Linklater's most visually distinctive movie, with exquisitely detailed renderings ... that are at the same time unstable, floaty, in a way perfect for a dreamed reality.
58926|1|Huston really gets the flavor of Stockton, CA, and with its run-down drinking establishments, sleazy gyms, and bad coffee joints.
13092|1|Scott is simply awesome as the one-of-a-kind General George Patton.
100575|1|Petit transforms his stories into mini-masterpieces of performance.
2244|1|Despite the cast taking themselves very seriously indeed, The Scarlet Letter is a great comic turn, complete with cod-accents and other period jiggery-pokery.
86534|1|I don't see how anyone who enjoys their animated movies won't enjoy all of this one.
18254|1|The true circumstances of Cobain's death remain cloudy, but one comes away from the film unnerved by the distance travelled.
26856|1|You could watch it on mute and still be blown away by the action bits.
86230|1|Nina Pens Rode has the right luminous quality for the romantic, uncompromising Gertrud, while the men are acceptable if sometimes overindulgent in their roles.
31212|1|Kenneth Branagh constructs a lush, compelling romantic noir, working beautifully with then-wife Emma Thompson.
91598|1|It's a convoluted, rich plot that goes back decades, but The Departed is so sure-footed it all makes sense.
21745|1|From a technical standpoint, Henry is amateurish. But ultimately it's not the gilded frame that made it a modern horror classic, but its unblinking portrait of a remorseless killer who stares back at the audience and forces them to turn away.
29281|1|John Boorman's 1972 film of the James Dickey novel has a beautiful visual style that balances the film's machismo message.
6445|1|Nine Indian women from England are thrown together on a trip.
29552|1|The picture is worth watching, if only for the scenes with the rhino and the lengthy opening sequence, which begins as a scratchy, sepia-toned silent film that gradually but gloriously develops into a colorful sound picture.
33775|0|It's not just the pacing. The Tigger Movie just doesn't show a lot of imagination.
46182|0|Funny Ah-nold
53779|1|Everytime you think Undercover Brother has run out of steam, it finds a new way to surprise and amuse.
53365|1|Hollywood Ending has its satirical charms, but it repeats itself remorselessly, and it has no emotional center.
52520|1|Nada excepcional, pero si gustan del humor mordaz pero moderado de DeVito no saldrán desilusionados.
21159|0|Nothing more than a dull retread of worn-out cliches, buoyed only by the much-anticipated return of a familiar face.
64573|0|It's as though for every good idea the movie has, someone from the writing committee jumped in and said, 'Yeah, but let's put a fart joke right after that.'
43278|0|The script and plot become far too predictable -- to the point that the audience knows exactly where it's going to go and reluctantly follows it.
20854|1|Depending on your point of view, either dark-sidedly brilliant or garbage heaped on top of whipped cream.
49758|1|A lark for everybody concerned, including the audience.
95980|0|An all-star cast and Pegg's larger-than-life turn can't stop this offbeat yarn being a bit of a snooze.
78841|1|One of those the truth is stranger than fiction stories.
27053|1|The third instalment of Universal's classic series features Boris Karloff's last fling as the Monster and is a superior shocker all round.
89320|1|...refreshing without going all goody two-shoe, its four friends and their ties to Atlanta not unlike the bunch of guys in Barry Levinson's Baltimore Diner.
34473|1|An absorbing, spirited film that merits considerable respect.
32003|0|Fatuous and soulless.
82216|1|Of all 2004's films, Million Dollar Baby is the one most likely to be cherished and revisited.
79945|1|"Brian De Palma's joke, in its manifold aspects, roasts the counterculture's naïveté regarding cinema as ""truth 24 frames per second"""
81856|1|An astute examination of youth culture that blows away Hollywood's pathetic attempts to get into the mind of a teen.
78517|1|Light-hearted, enjoyable caper flick that gets good mileage from both its stunning locations and its equally stunning cast.
91509|1|Educational and hilarious. The quintessential Laughton role!
93745|1|...a perfectly watchable (yet far-from-memorable) romantic comedy/coming-of-age story.
76821|1|[The love story] between the two young, uncorrupted stars suffuses the entire movie and has made me forgive, if not forget, the movie's flaws.
37718|1|Has a wonderful soundtrack, but it fails to provide an actual story unless you look hard...
51836|0|Not that anything's inherently wrong with a patriotic war movie, but there's a distastefulness in the film's simpleton view of mass suffering.
31579|0|The whole thing rather lacks juice.
3714|0|Miranda Richardson gives a distinguished, Oscar-nominated performance as poet T.S. Eliot's first, troubled wife in this disappointing and superficial biopic.
88616|1|it's a hypnotic mood piece on love and loss, one that knows -- at 75 minutes -- not to overstay its welcome.
28165|1|A near-masterpiece. De Niro is excellent.
1983|0|The problem for him[Gere], and the film, comes when the non-physical acting begins.
64753|1|dry, mannered, and very ironic
94312|0|Ultimately, the movie will be remembered (if at all) for its guerilla marketing campaign, which the city of Boston took to be a terrorist threat and cost Turner Broadcasting $2 million, more than the cost of making the film.
57011|1|Overlooked hard-boiled cop story.
52565|1|By the end of No Such Thing the audience, like Beatrice, has a watchful affection for the monster.
35153|0|There are wonderful performances here, as you'd expect from Hepburn and Tracy, and there's no question that the film is well intentioned. Yet it's also hamfisted and self-congratulatory in the most galling way.
75996|0|... the goings-on are neither very exciting nor terribly funny.
97006|0|While the film's mission to enrapture teenage boys (and other fans of grand adventure) is accomplished, I'd have to suggest to Mr. Zemeckis that it may be time to abandon this form of animation.
1993|0|Colorful, but ultimately disappointing...
53294|0|The depressing and amateurish screenplay makes the lead character into a totally unsympathetic bozo.
22785|1|As enveloping as it is darkly cautionary!
45604|1|Even when the story lingers at times, the central character is played so strongly that you can still stay with the film.
82522|1|Entertaining but flawed look behind suburbia's twitching curtains.
90211|1|"A nod to the old ""new kid in town"" formula film... it's better than you might expect."
36138|1|When it works, it's uniquely funny. When it doesn't, it's uniquely bad.
99339|1|A visual treat for Dafoe fans that goes well beyond the conventional horror genre into questions of reality and fantasy and how, or if, we tell the difference.
52086|1|A stunning futuristic thriller about cloning and immortality, The Island combines spectacle with controversy.
35516|0|It does not represent engaging entertainment for parents as well as their children.
19110|0|Carefully mounted, well directed and acted, but basically the sort of well-meaning pap out of which Oscars are made.
23386|0|Soldier seems destined for the trash heap!
51968|0|Should've been released as a lowkey DVD.
52087|1|The pace of this roller coaster ride becomes too furious to remember that it all started out as an adventure addressing some pertinent ethical issues about the pitfalls of stem cell research, cloning, and bio-genetics.
35677|1|A juicy thriller-romance bursting out of the Pentagon's arid corridors.
19486|0|Vigorous but rather scattered.
15874|0|Let's face it: Arnold is well-cast. But the movie takes itself way too seriously.
101288|1|Import Export demands we contemplate the horror and the beauty of existence in equal measure.
68511|1|National Velvet is not merely sure to delight children and the child in most adults; it is also an interesting psychological study of hysterical obsession, conversion mania, preadolescent sexuality.
88474|0|Just like the first film, it's another basic, unoriginal fish-out-of-water story stocked with predictable plot twists and physical comedy.
89845|1|Watching Mol in action in the title role, it's impossible to imagine anyone else in the part.
24251|0|It will no doubt appeal to eight-year-olds, but anyone older than that can pretty much be prepared to get to know their watchface very well.
50332|1|It looks fantastic, not least because it boasts helicopter scenes to rival those of Apocalypse Now.
15363|0|A ridiculous script and mediocre special effects mar this ludicrous disaster pic.
29970|1|I was impressed by the almost self-referential nature.
66007|1|Most powerful for its subtle and shaded characterizations of both victim and victimizer.
19099|1|As a courtroom drama, and as a depiction of government corruption, this film is pretty first rate.
72917|1|A fun film. I wish they'd bring back some of the lost magic to 'B' movies.
2386|1|Quietly moving story of a boy dealing with loss.
101863|0|If they want to keep making movies like this with Daniel Craig as a British secret agent, I think they should at least change his name to something besides Bond.
39640|0|A maquiagem é interessante, mas o roteiro é ridículo; as atuações, risíveis; a direção, medíocre; e os efeitos visuais, datados.
19701|1|A movie that has far more problems than its reputation would suggest, the kind of flaws that can be very readily glossed over in a fit of fond remembrance.
11514|1|A visual high point of film noir.
26396|1|Frenetic, audaciously structured and plot-heavy, packed with enough incident for at least three films.
74380|0|Bujold gives a sweet and creditable performance, though, and Burton adds some humanity to a character often portrayed simply as a monster. Yet they cannot salvage this sprawling mess.
80037|1|With Phibes now nominally the hero, the audience is ... invited to identify and laugh along with him as he polishes off everyone in his way.
77806|1|A big throbbing stress-headache of a movie, but you won't be able to turn it off.
4418|1|Speed lives up to its title, delivering carefully crafted action/adventure thrills without ever breaking out of the genre rut.
7920|1|A stimulating grainy black-and-white shot fictionalized biopic on the last two years of one of the great 20th century literary figures, Antonin Artaud.
91407|1|There is absolutely nothing hip or cool about Everyone's Hero, but it's so sweet, and so pleasant, and so nice that I found it impossible to dislike.
4065|1|A curiously gripping amalgam of Patton, Citizen Kane and Melvin and Howard.
60614|1|Laurel Canyon telegraphs far too much of its unoriginal story to genuinely hold our interest. We find ourselves wishing we could leave these characters nattering in the living room and wander around the house looking at the souvenirs and photographs. We'r
81752|0|Penn is terrific in his low-key doggedness.
78822|1|This third installment takes a less reverent and a more behind-the-scenes approach.
42062|1|I am embarrassed for having laughed at it, but not too embarrassed to suggest that you might laugh as well.
79234|1|Marvellously eloquent, and touchingly accurate in accessing the secret landscape of a child's mind.
49780|0|The film is a mess, though hardly on the panoramic scale of Heaven's Gate.
99181|1|Comedian Doug Benson determines what it would be like to get high for thirty days. What would this prove? Probably nothing, but it was really funny to watch.
38993|0|As a satire, Cecil B. Demented is uninspired, and, as a motion picture, it's unfunny, charmless, and amateurish.
55213|0|The movie has lots of dancing and fabulous music. There are slow and repetitive parts, but it has just enough spice to keep it interesting.
63457|1|The film is superbly acted by Mr. Polanski, Mr. Douglas and Miss Winters.
11940|1|An inordinately smart and sly motion picture, one that has enough simple pleasures to succeed as one of the better popcorn movies of its decade.
78964|1|Sherlock Jr. is Keaton's signature statement, and mind-warping flight of fancy on the dreamlike nature of films and the fluid nature of our ontological existence.
54590|1|Click to read review
35360|1|The story of a cosmic visitation among ordinary folk-turned-obsessives, Spielberg's masterpiece is that rare blockbuster -- at once grown-up, yet full of fairytale, childlike wonder.
100633|0|What starts out as a hokey satire on electioneering and spin becomes a hokey lesson on civic responsibility, with a catch in the throat and a tear in the eye. Try to suppress the curl in your lip.
32361|0|Disappointing.
21591|1|The plotting is crude and haphazard, but the dialogue is amusing and the cast is appealing.
52969|0|About as scary as a bagel that's been left out on the counter overnight. Okay, maybe it's a raisin bagel. I'll give you that much.
8039|1|As with many of his other films, Rohmer proves that social intercourse can be as delightful as the sexual variety.
75885|0|What a disappointing waste of good talent!
83502|0|Good potential with the crazy doctor, but it turns into just another slasher movie. The cop breaking up the party is the best scene.
27761|0|This is a film about sex that isn't sexy; a movie about love with a cold heart.
57048|1|One of the classics of the Chinese fantasy genre. required viewing for any fan of Chinese cinema.
97450|1|An entertaining tear jerker of a story about two old men facing the end of two very different lives.
78945|1|This classic in horror is mainly enjoyed for its powerful visuals.
51209|1|"Quite possibly the best ""modernizing"" of a Shakespeare tale in recent memory."
86984|0|Narrated by Nic Cage in a zombie-like monotone, this flick is not only gross and morose, but relentlessly depressing.
36395|0|Although I wouldn't quite go so far as to recommend it, the movie does have a terrific look and some intriguing, albeit overly dramatic, acting.
42827|0|An American football comedy which replays all the situations and clichés from the baseball saga Major League, but with a minor-league cast and clumsy direction from Stan Dragoti.
28021|1|Truffaut's ode to his childhood is an engrossing watch that is alluring in its simplicity and brilliant in its direction. It flows nicely at its own pace, never allowing melodrama to ruin its realistic and voyeuristic atmosphere.
64438|0|Exists in a place beyond criticism. It hasn't got a plot to speak of, or characters; like the recent Rollerball remake, it in many ways verges on the experimental.
49740|0|A brainless plot would be almost forgiveable were it not for the perverse depiction of innocents butchered in Invasion U.S.A.
2365|1|Carried on the strong shoulders of its protagonists, scene-stealers all, the film succeeds in being fun and even touching, though the story itself is somewhat thin and cliched.
79490|1|A picture so original in style that it sometimes seems downright peculiar.
58228|1|"There is little that is subtle about the Borat film - it's a ""make sex on your face"" kind of experience, an onslaught of Jew, Gay, ""foreign"", Baptist and Texan jokes. It's also very, very funny."
68243|0|Does the fun ever start?
82111|1|A thoroughly entertaining glimpse of a world most people don't know even exists -- and whether they wanted to know it exists may be a question.
3926|1|The music is loud and raw, but nevertheless evokes the excitement it generated.
94140|1|Equal parts dog adventure and father-son tale.
5350|0|Being an appealing, shallow goof-off can wear thin, and Shore seems incapable of carrying a movie, even when it's a 90-minute knock-off like this.
43192|0|What an unremarkable movie this is.
36387|0|A terminally cute bit of feminist whimsy.
33336|1|"No one was more surprised than I was that not only did this ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch work as a film, it worked twice, and uproariously both times."
13585|1|"Structured in the standard ""rockumentary"" form that alternates performance footage with talking head interviews, Hype! derives much of its charm from the wonderfully likable bunch of goofballs Pray elected to interview."
78926|0|Now that we've had the four more years of Bush that the movie was designed to encourage ... Celsius 41.11 seems pretty sad and naive.
71741|0|With repetitive scenes of their rambling road trip, Twentynine Palms is more like a Humvee commercial, with plenty of hummers along the way.
67096|1|"Viewing ""Shoah"" today proves that the Holocaust is not a discrete event, but rather an ongoing public narrative in which the movie continues to play a crucial part."
75274|1|It is an essential fiction, a short story whose diminutive length does little to foretell its breadth.
89877|0|An undemanding morality tale set in the Bible Belt.
20189|1|A disjointed but funny look at a fictitious, blue collar, Polish American family, Polish Wedding manages to be enjoyable due to its winning cast and charmingly buoyant aura that permeates the film.
783|0|Spirited but uneven.
42273|0|Too dumb and too vulgar for anyone.
58862|1|As a hangout movie for kids, My Neighbor Totoro pleases with its easygoing pace, curiosity about the natural world, and sweet spirit.
97931|0|It spends so much time reminding of how quaint and kooky it is throughout that you may find yourself pulling out your wallet or purse and offering it some of your hard-earned money if it will agree to just simmer down and go away
26351|1|You'll want to learn to tango after seeing this sumptuous movie.
33824|0|Just something that those with a morbid curiosity for the unusual in sleaze might not be able to pass on.
9037|1|Citizen Kane has been cited as the greatest film ever made from so many different quarters, it's a wonder that a Congressional law hasn't been passed making it required viewing for anyone who claims they like movies.
95860|0|Somewhere in The Invasion is a good movie scratching to get out.
15247|1|On the whole, Anna Karenina is a picture of merit. It is decorative, well-meaning, and full of neat encounters, and it certainly presents a Garbo in the high summer of her maturity, richer and more mellow than she has ever been before.
80395|1|On the surface El Norte is the essence of simplicity. But in 1983, the simple story was both news to many and history to many others finally seeing their story depicted on screen on their terms. [Blu-ray]
51985|0|As overwrought as [My Left Foot] was understated.
22753|1|The film's entire cast and crew prove up to the task, and there's something both comfortably old-fashioned and blazingly contemporary about Aaron Sorkin's screenplay.
97622|0|If tickets to this yuletide dreck are hiding in your stocking, you'd be better off with a lump of coal.
78807|0|The two leads don't have any chemistry, especially the flat, emotionless Tucker.
57729|1|...guaranteed to turn Motown neophytes into fans.
985|1|Memorably simple, memorably resonant.
52902|1|It's not too often that a remake holds up to the original, but Mangold's rendition blows the 1957 version out of the water in every imaginable way possible.
63665|1|With eloquent dialogue but scant smoldering passions, the mushy machinations nicely nudge director Tim Fywell's gentle little film.
89821|0|...plays like a confusing and inferior Caribbean analog to The Godfather, without anything like the narrative drive of Coppola's film.
82179|1|Overlong, heavy-handed and thoroughly humourless it may be, but it is also a spectacularly stylised mutation of the way we look at the world of war.
102012|0|'Soul Men' is a mediocre film at best, buoyed by the abrasive chemistry of Bernie Mac and Samuel L. Jackson.
37188|1|As well as providing a generous helping of shocks, Kneale's script gives his complex themes and theories plenty of space...
34015|1|I got caught up in the global chess game, in the bluffing and the dares, the dangerous strategy of using nuclear blackmail against a fanatic who might call the bluff.
20098|0|More of the same, but it's now so far removed from any sense of reality, and done with such ham-fisted insistence, it's become a clumsy parody of itself.
65288|0|You sense Spade is scared of what finding too much of himself in Dickie might mean.
101229|0|There's nothing righteous about this tired and tiresome good cop/bad cop NYPD procedural from Avnet; in fact, it's pretty much an abomination from the get-go.
83348|0|The film -- and its characters -- are full of quirks. But it tries a little too hard, especially where the quirks are concerned.
17686|1|...a precariously balanced movie, one that flirts with smugness. That it isn't awful is in some respects amazing.
44536|0|Gets bogged down in enough 'event' to choke a miniseries.
97099|1|Darfur Now will have to act as a moral entertainment, a conscientious objection we buy tickets to see.
85431|1|"Of all the exuberantly built-up beats, Taraji P. Henson's beautifully shocked and elated response to unexpectedly forming the nucleus of ""It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp"" gives ""Hustle"" its soul and won that song an Oscar."
73800|1|This is a movie that lends a voice to a good chunk of the youth population. It's a voice that just wants to be heard. Is that too much to ask?
11678|1|A mesmerizing poetic work composed in an eerie minor key.
28467|1|Could well be William Castle's masterpiece.
79830|1|Narrative common sense is abandoned for fractured, highly satisfying storytelling.
71204|1|A remarkable and unusual achievement.
95041|1|Rescue Dawn may not feel much like a Herzog movie, but it's a gripping real-life thriller.
46111|1|Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have reconvened to bring us this belated, yet very welcome sequel.
48869|1|See it for the stunning visuals and Depp's performance rather than a factual re-telling -- if you can stomach it.
21970|0|Dull and way too long, Torn Curtain is only memorable for one very shocking and brutal scene.
92959|0|A starring vehicle for an aging star who receives deafening awards buzz not so much for the performance than, it seems, for simply being alive.
100637|0|The cynical vote-chasing ploys of the political machines are cheekily spoofed....and then the grand conceit is deserted and the whole caboodle slides into a tacky vat of sentimental, flag-waving gloop.
61228|1|...an overly complex narrative puzzle placed amid an atmospheric setting with distracting voice-over narration by Holbrook's town sheriff as he reflects on a tragedy that makes mute a local orphan...
42441|1|"""Pixote"" is an amazing cinematic social document made with fury and passion by an uncompromising director. There has never been another film that approaches its depiction of Brazil's condemned youth, not even ""City of God."""
19747|1|For all its shoddiness, the film manages, just barely, to achieve its ignoble goals -- it delivers what it promises.
22540|0|Pah-lease...so goofy
96630|1|Part of the reason this film works so splendidly is that, given its ending, it doesn't have the luxury of pretend redemption.
25275|1|Ignore the ridiculous happy ending of this film, and you have a much more fatalistic exercise in which Coppola eschews easy laughs in favour of the exposure of feeling and the fact that these people's lives, however empty, matter to them.
48513|0|Schoolyard bullying is a touchy issue these days, having been pinpointed as the root of many larger crises such as school shootings. Too bad Keeblesed the opportunity to teach kids something about it.
61871|0|"As if we needed feature length versions of MTV's ""The Real World,"" served up this weekend is two hours of Cancun hysteria. Is it real? Yup - real dumb."
71369|1|An original if incoherent fable about the intricate relationships between a cop, a girl, and a gangster whose tone shifts radically from scene to scene, unable to reconcile between the story's softer love elements and its harder urban edges.
52914|1|The result is that the film's message about sportsmanship decency becomes thoroughly anodyne. Entertaining nevertheless.
10728|1|This hilarious tale of criminal incompetence and transatlantic eccentricity is easily John Cleese's finest achievement since Fawlty Towers.
53881|1|A witty little thriller emerges as Zoe, under house arrest, resourcefully stretches her electronic anklet's restrictions.
31653|0|The problem lies in a sloppy screenplay and direction that's too slick to be credible. Added to that, while Thompson often makes acting look natural, Hoffman these days makes natural look like acting.
63900|0|A reeking stinker of a comedy.
52050|1|He Knows You're Alone inspires sustained, high-decibel shrieking when Mastroianni cuts loose, but it ingratiates itself in a more congenial way by being so mischievosly movie-crazy and by swift strokes of characterization and funny romatic by play.
63431|1|Rhapsody in August is an old man's film in the best possible sense. Though it stares death straight in the face, it is primarily interested in life.
91691|1|It's a shame that The Marine did not receive a theatrical release in Australia. Not only was much of it shot here, but as an action popcorn adventure, it has reasonable merit.
69144|0|Its only interest now is in its representation of its era.
75800|1|The documentary that, according to HBO, isn't good enough for you to see.
12536|1|[Has] an abundance of charm and wisdom and heart, thanks to the appealing cast and smart script...
92945|1|A subtle, elegant meditation on friendship and identity in a cultural moment where honest cultivation of either is treated like a luxury.
64112|1|The plotting is weak, and ill-served by the movie's generally lackadaisical approach; but the dialogue is witty, and Wilder and Diamond get a lot of mileage out of the idea that Sherlock Holmes is as fragile as he is brilliant.
26020|0|What De Niro ends up doing is simply burlesquing himself, much as he would do if he were guest-hosting Saturday Night Live.
14698|0|A renter with some mileage on it.
50950|1|Occasionally it strikes one that [Lang] wanted to include too much and then that all one anticipates does not appear. But at the same time the various ideas have been spliced together quite adroitly.
61150|0|The capable cast is wasted in this fluff piece.
94870|1|CASHBACK is a likable film that is bolstered by Ellis' terrific eye for composition.
31859|1|"Williams gives his best ""straight"" performance, shorn of all his marvelous manic vaudeville. The man he plays here is not a performer, which he was even in Dead Poets Society, but simply a man."
49304|0|No plot, no originality, no stars -- and no reason for you to go and see this crap.
81920|1|A smart and scary film.
32863|1|Director Bob Rafelson attempts something unusual here, making a film that's subtle about its meaning without ever ranging into the pretentiously oblique or merely ambiguous.
73771|1|It's a triumph of the underdog film, but what it does have is a simply delicious performance by Alan Rickman, who does resigned disdain like no one else on screen.
66023|0|What worked on the stage doesn't on film.
69147|1|Even though this feels relatively streamlined by Cassavetes' standards, I thought it was eminently watchable, if not exceptionally profound.
10285|0|Virtual reality aside, The Lawnmower Man suffers all the usual problems: the cliched story is further undermined by wooden performances, and the inevitable unhappy ending.
53613|1|There has been no shortage of interpretations of Conan Doyle's great detective over the years, but, with apologies to Benedict Cumberbatch, Peter Cushing remains one of the greatest.
42395|0|A case of the emperor's old clothes: drab, sentimental rags that desperately want to be something else.
75115|0|Easily the worst in a miserable franchise, Mission to Moscow makes Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol look like Battleship Potemkin.
83326|1|If I can't say I'm looking forward to the next one, neither can I ignore the medicinal properties of Pooh's latest big-screen outing.
85434|1|...an inspiring and ennobling character study in which love and respect trump pure success.
42782|1|The big part of Lee's film commemorates the lives of the '4 little girls' who died, through the memories of parents, siblings and friends.
98920|0|Waters is trying to have his cake and eat it out too.
11519|0|"So bad it's painful. If there wasn't a ""Terminator,"" there would be no ""Ahnuld."""
14775|1|Any film that features Johnny Depp performing salutes to the great silent comedians (and, in particular, Buster Keaton) deserves a little slack... [Blu-ray]
79271|1|Sturges lets it all hang out, never passes over a joke and somehow manages to sustain the pace and quality.
78876|0|Samuell has his gorgeous but borderline-psychopathic characters devise nasty pranks that not only strike each other in the hearts but inflict much collateral damage.
20593|1|An exciting time travel adventure.
73853|1|The jokes are firmly embedded in plot and characterisation, and the film, shot by Gordon Willis in harsh black-and-white, looks terrific; but what makes it work so well is the unsentimental warmth pervading every frame.
52563|0|It's a film with an idea buried somewhere inside its fabric, but never clearly seen or felt.
100622|1|...a thoroughly affable piece of work that makes up in easy-going entertainment what it lacks in plausibility.
101642|0|"'There's this guy, Tank, and other guys hire him to give their exes ""emotional terrorism."" It's a romantic comedy.''Can you throw in a cheap anti-Catholic and anti-Semitic joke? And have Tank tell some kids how to pull a brutal sexaul trick on a woman?'"
100981|0|Brutal horror movie offers little to reflect on.
2238|1|Still impressive Cold War thriller from a time when WW III seemed inevitable.
17097|1|For what it is, essentially a steamy and well-made period-piece, 'Artemisia' plays fairly effectively.
4698|1|A very familiar dish, but prepared reasonably well.
93763|1|This amiable British romantic comedy further confirms the gifts of star James McAvoy.
58274|1|The film manages to remain engaging, because even if most of the film is about Mooney just being moody, it certainly looks good on her.
56454|1|[The kind of] story that stays with kids, becomes more meaningful to them as grownups.
39555|1|Ultimately, it's a tribute to the power of cinema.
78467|0|A train wreck of mind-numbing proportions.

21804|0|What is it about dance, that most joyous of arts, that inspires so many bad movies?
9892|1|For sheer inventiveness of situation and the charm that such an idea projects, The Love Bug rates as one of the better entries of the Disney organization.
45188|1|In the dingy, black-and-white halls of the film noir pantheon, they've a special place set aside for Kiss Me Deadly.
14916|0|Pass that can of Black Flag, hon.
66869|0|full review in Greek
13525|1|One of the funniest, if slightest, Westerns of recent years.
71385|0|This is the kind of hypertensive trash that gives melodrama a bad name, cynically tempering its naughty bits with smug moralizing.
60399|0|A real snooze.
11814|1|Still provocative.
167|1|as the 1995 film veers away from the romance, into definable (and dated) political issues, it loses some of its magic.
45669|1|Hard-hitting and ultimately unforgettable
99657|1|Manages to entertain and dazzle, and parents won't beat themselves up for sitting through it, although what it teaches could fit on a fortune cookie.
97678|1|Directors Jaume Balagueró and Paco Plaza, rising stars in the Spanish horror scene, create a buzzing urgency in a familiar premise...
27494|1|My enjoyment of this sci-fi series is nothing compared with the fanaticism of hard-core devotees of Gene Roddenberry's cultural phenomenon.
95354|1|...comes off as precisely the sort of silly and nonsensical piece of work that one might've expected...
21546|1|Ponderous, yet unique and strangely charming.
93850|1|This is a film made with obvious care and affection, both for the specifics of the story and the broader society it depicts.
44172|1|A definitive piece of Americana by way of Howard Hawks, Rio Bravo is what the late 1950s studio system was all about
38319|1|By far director/actor Keenen Ivory Wayans' best parody effort to date, primarily because he here taps into a rejuvenated genre and is given access to broader subject matter with universal appeal.
94407|0|Ah, poor poor Carter. Will he emerge strengthened or diminished by his encounters in this faraway land?
20009|1|After a quarter-century, Poltergeist remains one of the most popular movies whose reputation rests almost exclusively on behind-the-scenes diversions.
10191|1|An emotionally chilly exercise... At the same time it is gorgeous indeed, one of the most singular movies in the Disney canon visually.
91165|0|Perhaps future generations of film scholars will embrace The Quiet as a B-movie that problematizes the oppressive gaze, but for now, it's a misfire.
13034|0|Not one of Capra's best. Grant is too hammy and out of control, and without Boris Karloff as Jonathan Brewster, the joke is lost.
15825|1|It's not brilliant or for adults, but it's a nice, pleasant movie you can pretend to be eight years old with.
77810|1|Hardcore is a vivid and convincing parable about the dangers of spiritual pride.
64402|0|A disappointing adaptation of the best-selling novel, neither satisfying as thriller or as adventure.
62546|1|Annoying as it is in some ways, is worth seeing for Brody's performance alone.
57866|0|When an old scallawag spies on Lilli bathing naked in a waterfall, we civilized viewers are primed to condemn him. But we're all scallawags here.
22327|1|Alfred Hitchcock, England's jovial and rotund master of melodrama, has turned out another crisply paced, excellently performed film.
25319|0|Ponderous and absurd, like the novel. As a stand-in for Mailer, O'Neal is limp.
27218|0|It is a good example of the kind of mediocre, paranoiac sci-fi films that were being made at the time.
80737|1|Wong's always-striking visual style uses floating, neon colors and extreme angles to emphasize disconnected souls.
49937|1|There's so much to note in this film, from the dance costumes to the use of the camera and von Sternberg's sense of humour
52507|0|A family-friendly fantasy that ends up doing very little with its imaginative premise.
60484|0|Unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups, not much camera movement, and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters.
31468|1|Overrated potboiler with preposterously innacurate courtroom scenes. But Newman is great.
5585|0|If Menace II Society is terrific on ambiance, it is considerably less successful in revealing character.
20086|1|A phenomenally successful, noisy, violent buddy movie.
17076|1|... may be the most unapologetic, intimate portrayal of a religious man in the history of American cinema.
39359|0|Pleasing in the most superficial of ways.
6434|1|A movie of somewhat indulgent introspection, a confection of twentysomething ambivalence.
27451|1|Say what you will about Miramax's alleged underhanded business practices and big-bucks campaigns to buy itself Academy Awards, the studio definitely knows how to package a satisfying movie adaptation of a classic of English Literature.
37612|1|... this often-hilarious spoof on daytime soap operas achieves much success borrowing from the 'divorce-remarriage' variation of the screwball comedy.
64270|0|[E]ven fans of the filmmakers will be hardpressed to consider this one of their great ones.
28458|1|The Lubitsch Touch is clearly here. Colorful, tongue firmly in cheek comedy-fantasy.
80869|0|It's too back that wrestling icon Hulk Hogan didn't know how to apply a choke hold to this lethargic and lightweight romp. An unintentional and embarrassing misstep
19961|0|worst entry in one of the worst series ever
70127|1|What starts out as a thriller switches en route into a sagging, psychological drama, but recovers in time to give out with the satisfying gory stuff.
18326|0|And you thought it couldn't get worse than Part 2.
29592|1|Rather than simply repeating the successful formula of Yojimbo, which incorporated humor but largely played it straight, Sanjuro flips the script for a largely comic action picture punctuated by a dark, rug-yanking conclusion. [Blu-ray]
54135|0|I can't imagine anyone taking anything positive away from Juwanna Mann, other than the conviction that it's not a very good movie.
33924|1|The underlying secret of the four comedians is the way they find humor in daily life, and in their families.
9185|0|surprisingly tedious
46710|0|The film isn't just banal, it's aggressively, arrogantly banal.
30287|1|Has the look and feel of something unearthed in an archeological dig - a primitive piece of folk art.
75008|1|People who love cats will see their own felines in Garfield. Parents who love neither Garfield nor cats will have a good time nonetheless.
15719|1|A cheeky comedy that rates at least three bouquets.
8928|1|The film is made up almost entirely of talk, and yet the performances are so wonderfully flamboyant and focused that conversations become the action of the movie.
31833|1|It's as honest and direct and entertaining as the considerable talents of everyone involved can make it.
82892|1|Sub par Preston Sturges comedy starring Dick Powell.
42872|0|The film does exhibit a major problem typical of book adaptations; it's overburdened with plot and supporting characters.
48295|1|MGM's elegant remake of the superior 1937 version.
42898|1|We're given time to let the impact of this feat truly impact us.
5036|1|It's impossible to say whether Dave will play as wonderfully over the decades as it does right now, but this smooth-as-silk comedy could not be more timely, or connect more hopefully with our current national consciousness.
95102|1|The best film made by Lindsay Anderson.
100550|0|The tears and laughter are genuine enough, but Berstein's orchestrations make her less of a fly on the wall than a fly in the ointment.
63131|0|Unless you're a Nickelodeon executive or a six-year-old who's never heard of Pixar, you'll be fervently hoping such desperate tactics signal the end of this tiresome spin-off franchise.
49573|1|"Anzio's not exactly considered a ""classic"" in the war-story genre, but it'll absolutely do for a rainy Saturday matinee."
39847|1|Extremely heavy-handed satire from director Spike Lee -- disturbing and thought-provoking but ultimately lacking a sense of focus.
92299|1|Freeman and Paz winningly play off each other.
49248|1|Unlike some other filmed plays, this one contains dialogue that sounds realistic.
14811|0|The by-the-numbers athlete story is interesting, but leaves no lasting impression.
18221|1|A nifty psychological thriller that puts a few new twists on the well worn detective genre.
90200|0|A perfunctory and unintentionally goofy attempt to keep the series running without its stars Vin Diesel and Paul Walker.
15262|0|In the end, it adds up to nothing more than a humorless, forgettable nostalgia piece with carefully re-created costumes and settings from the Eisenhower years.
40951|0|The film, clocking in at a mere two hours, feels much, much longer.
12283|1|...a justifiably iconic war film.
42294|0|Corny as, uh, heck, with no shortage of weak performances and some glaring technical glitches.
86285|0|a live-action feature that captures all too depressingly the original TV cartoon's evolution from inventive weirdfest to a more run-of-the-mill brand of dystopian cyberpunk.
9582|1|If you can stand Kaye (oh for a tranquilizer gun!), this one's not bad.
44082|1|Somehow it never gets old.
54907|1|Fun but deeply, ridiculously silly.
86540|1|Ideally mindless and entertaining in every way.
56002|1|The Tuxedo is sort of like a film that might have been made from a song by Burt Bacharach; its central conceit is odd, implausible, even a bit silly, but one can hardly begrudge it those elements when the thing plays so beautifully.
57442|1|The screenwriters have brought Bond back toward the book.
8083|0|Big dumb fun, for sure, but not big and clever.
77729|1|Pretty nasty stuff for its time.
29093|1|A unique and often brilliant animated film that pictures the Beatles as towering and often god-like gentlemen who have the power to change worlds...
39388|0|To sum it up in critic-speak, Bait doesn't stink, but it's not very appetizing.
84295|1|Glossy, sanitized remake of the brilliant 1931 James Whale film
86665|0|... is so meandering it can make a sober viewer into a drunk.
19985|1|A Hip, equally satisfying sequel...Chucky's badder than ever!
97563|0|The world's most illogical and boring action-horror grudge-match between two dull trademarked franchise monsters is back on.
12131|1|Few films more effectively capture the crumbling infrastructure and opportunistic lawlessness of postwar Europe. And none better translate the snaking treachery of Graham Greene's stories and his worlds of cynical expats and casual betrayal.
64228|1|Funny but not a comedy, slow but not plodding, narrow in scope but not uninteresting.
621|1|An incredible exercise in style.
96698|0|"The more James groans to an unsympathetic ear, ""Why would they remake Marty--it's timeless?"" we wonder why Garlin didn't take his own advice"
55853|0|I felt trapped and with no obvious escape for the entire 100 minutes.
85357|0|full review in Greek
51109|0|Jonathan Demme's debut film is campy, choppy, and generally immature, though his bonding themes are fitfully discernible amid the cartoonish action.
6275|1|The film's strategy is to present many diverse fragments about Gould, each capturing an aspect of his artistry and/or personality, so that the cumulative effect would give the viewer a glimpse of the man and his times.
54394|0|Utilising the cheapest-looking animation ever to grace a cinema screen, this Cartoon Network spin-off will only appeal to a fraction of pre-teen girls.
64750|1|It was Voltaire, probably, who said that if Alec Guinness did not exist it would be necessary for Ealing Studios to invent him.
31947|1|The narrative may not be exact in its details..., but it is undoubtedly true to the spirit of the real events.
18223|1|Both Mr. Pullman and the slyly restrained Mr. Stiller keep their characters entertaining even when Mr. Kasdan's interest is elsewhere.
6933|1|Predictable, yet eminently watchable.
90667|0|Forster lards over his whimsically feeble film with sentimentality.
29907|1|A second chance for Malick to cast away the chemical stained print and achieve the film he envisioned, and a second chance for audiences to experience a true classic on the big screen.
471|1|With each frame filled to bursting point with visual detail and multiplaned design, plus razor-sharp cutting that often eliminates transitions, it's not a movie you can afford to take your eyes off for a second.
6429|1|You have to admire the style, sincerity, and overall sense of craft even if you don't fancy the comic-book gore.
75320|1|Makes the most of a misunderstanding over maternity.
13680|0|The way to eternal life is through sex, electric shock, and staying out of the light. Who'da thunk?
27642|1|It has likable characters and infectiously funny situations, and that's about all a comedy like this needs.
81444|0|Points for trying and all, but this particular chapter of South Africa's history deserves a movie a bit more sincere -- and a lot less corny.
73944|1|As a sociological tract it's right on the money, as a psychological thriller it wanders at times too far away from the money.
50184|1|For those who appreciate movies that capture almost every emotion -- from laughter to tears, suspense to tranquillity -- The Majestic was made for you.
14485|1|Graphic mystery-homage to teen-slasher movies.
33159|0|Here is a movie that needed great trash, great sex and great gossip, and at all the crucial moments Susann is talking to a tree.
94725|0|This third outing sadly lacks in ambition and, at times, even offers the whiff of sitcom plotting and plodding.
93972|1|Andrei Kravchuk's film is sensitive to the hilt and pleasingly attuned to the guileless outlook of its hero.
6842|1|Uplifting film that celebrates the ties that link people together despite vast differences.
99432|1|Bella is an irrefutably effortless and heartwarming film, another indie gem with a deep soul and a beautiful message.
47846|0|After about half an hour, looking at wounds and comparing workout rituals gets a bit tedious.
90041|1|A film with both fart and heart, and is highly recommended for the willing and able.
71848|0|Takes too long to get to its one moving moment at the end.
88206|0|Hostel's merely unpleasant and more than a little dumb.
84520|1|Delicately balances the sordid and rough with the childlike and fantastic...
87070|1|powerhouse acting, all around
76168|1|Sparkling romantic fun; Martin is superb and Hannah is delightful
14627|1|Strangely beautiful
96313|1|For his sheer muscular verve and ambition, Lee deserves a standing ovation.
64621|0|A lot of what's entertaining today about Thrashin' is inadvertent.
22943|0|The book is so complete, so deep and so self-contained that it shuts the movie out. Bertolucci shows us the outsides and the surfaces, and a person seeing this movie without having read the book might ask what it is about.
87700|1|Campbell Scott, Peter Sarsgaard and Patricia Clarkson fill the disconcerting material with measured, subtle performances that bring home what's not being said.
25967|1|"Fans will enjoy it, but the ""Apes"" gang could have done a little better. Not surprisingly, this was the fifth and last installment. (Unless you count the TV show...)"
38744|1|If you're only going to see one average film this year, it's worth putting this one on the short list.
62799|1|Does cinema get any better than this?
61606|1|Those who have read the book will no doubt overlook the film's shortcomings and parents will welcome a movie that doesn't talk down to its youthful audience.
4117|0|Forrest Gump is a schmaltz-Zelig, a Being There engineered from the genetic material of a Hallmark card.
15577|1|... as powerful a film as has been made about the interior life of children.
58061|0|"doomed to conformity from the outset by its very setting, which also dictates that the primary themes revolve around honor, loyalty, honesty, and all those other important concepts that define ""uplifing"" message movies"
64327|1|The result is uneven, but not without distinction.
4340|1|Comedy about 20-something slackers isn't for kids.
30498|0|Whine. Whine. Have Sex. Whine.
85744|1|There's a constant tension in the air, as if the characters could make catastrophic decisions at any moment but the film consistently surprises you by upturning the expected cliches.
87318|1|Interesting and worth watching, despite the fact that complete comprehension of the film seems just beyond the reach of the viewer.
91206|1|There are moments that stir, and it's always lovely, but it's generally too remote to gain hold of you truly.
66674|1|Illustrates much of what is good and some of what is bad about American independent cinema.
86929|0|A disaster from beginning to end. If you're going to Stay anywhere, Stay at home.
33029|0|Michael Keaton as a malicious tenant. Aren't you scared just thinking about it?
62157|1|A promising debut that makes us anticipate this Columbia University film grad's sophomore work.
46837|0|Eventually it mutates into a paranoid revenge plot that might be called Walking Short.
38260|0|A huge step down from the original; a huge improvement over Part 3.
97095|1|While it has the appearance of a made-for-TV weepie, it's well-acted, technically proficient, a solid story with genuine, credible emotions.
71636|0|An exasperating film about teen violence and suburban dysfunction that wears its confusion like a badge of honor.
32056|0|What can one say about a film whose idea of comedy is having the two women sit around discussing whether or not they've had an 'organism' or not?
28899|0|Horrible adaptation of a wonderful story. Rent the anime version, instead.
65027|1|Solid docu about global-warming informs rather than preaches.
48954|1|With flavorful acting, direction and cinematography, Burnt Money touches on emotions universal to any relationship.
58975|1|It's a very philosophical film, with an interesting and somewhat fearless exploration of Hitler the man.
79898|1|Inspired by Guthrie's ballad, Arthur Penn's film is a summation of the anti-establishment, anti-Vietnam War generation, clinging to the ideal of a collectivist life in a Stockbridge commune.
1087|0|If nothing else, proves that when you take Julia's lipstick away, much of her appeal goes, too.
25309|0|The most boring comedy I have ever seen.
86104|1|This trifling love story is thoroughly ridiculous but still surprisingly enjoyable
83004|0|A highly polished turd, perhaps the shiniest money can buy... by now the only way De Niro can shock us is by maybe appearing in a movie that isn't a total embarassment.
30990|1|It's half a really good movie, and half a mediocre one with a good actor.
97691|1|The characters are fleshed out participants in the mayhem, not merely disposable vessels designed to stand in all the right places when buildings come crashing down.
29897|1|Murray provides an interesting performance; the movie grows on you.
21031|1|The Rocketeer is a throwback to when movie heroes weren't burdened by irony or existential angst.
17115|1|What makes the film so disturbing is that it charts much of what happens in the normal course of growing up -- filtered through the main character's warped sense of reality.
53949|0|You'd probably be better off reading Catch 22 - even if it is for the fifth time . . .
69667|0|Young Tamimi is a terrific rider but a lackluster screen presence, and the film's brevity ensures that her trials have a perfunctory quality that keeps them from being truly compelling.
81935|1|Jonathan Swift would be proud.
66418|1|Soap opera, to be sure, but reasonably entertaining
93896|0|For the love of Chucky, avoid this insipid attempt at reviving the killer doll horror.
29132|0|...Blue Streak is simply unable to overcome the scenery-chewing excess of Lawrence's hopelessly incompetent turn.
52021|1|Told in a magnificently opulent cinematic style.
72199|0|... this is basically just a sitcom.
24023|1|One of Chase's best
31687|1|A pioneering film, in both senses of the word, and one of the key works in the American cinema of the 1970s.
49371|1|This Hitchcockian yarn compensates for its leading man's rather anonymous performance with some well-placed shocks, a morbid sense of humour, and a climax that will literally put your teeth on edge.
16486|1|Interesting, but didn't love it.
100794|1|A seemingly forced ending, keep Elegy from being more than a character vehicle for one of our greatest actors and an opportunity for some creative dialogue on the pitfalls of romance.
76587|1|Director David L. Cunningham, working on a small budget, skillfully combines scenes of action and anxiety with substantial character development.
78866|1|Love Me If You Dare presents a...cynical and often downright cruel perspective on relationships, though the film's bubbly look keeps it from becoming too dark.
88604|0|O roteiro atravessa a fronteira do ridículo no terceiro ato.
79854|0|The picture never quite finds its tone.
77845|0|Dire and dunderheaded.
4683|0|Uninvolving, abysmally scripted horror picture.

16764|0|The audience seems limited to the director's inner circle.
2299|1|The ending is still pat, with lots of reasons for optimism, but Something is not as neatly -- or falsely -- resolved as most Hollywood films.
48274|1|This comic extravaganza starts off funny, but exhausts rather than delights.
49337|0|If a white filmmaker were behind the wretched ugliness that is The Wash, he'd be branded the most racist director since D.W. Griffith.
63824|1|A bummer, but one that manages to stick to its depraved convictions until the strange and bitter end.
20231|0|After a few good scenes, the plot gets too tricky, and the filmmakers keep walloping us with one chase scene after another.
6516|1|The passion and poignancy of trying to communicate with the dead is well-exploited here. Moore has never been more fetching.

95341|1|You feel like you've stumbled across a lost treasure from some studio's vaults that was meant to be buried forever.
77109|1|Certainly a historic record of one of the all-time best comedians, and funny!
30545|0|...the film forsakes most of its progenitor's lighthearted yet moving emotional appeal and replaces it with gunfire, car chases, and explosions.
57877|0|Just say no.
59345|0|This could easily be a made-for-TV movie.
63481|0|Energetic contemporary takeoff on the Hollywood screwball comedies of the 1930s.
6570|1|Dances with Wolves is as genuine an artistic triumph as they come; a spellbinding American classic that tastes the tears of a country in the midst of all its incomparable beauty.
30215|1|perhaps the most post-9/11 film to have been made pre-9/11, capturing perfectly both the stirring discontent of the Nineties and the madness (both geopolitical and especially economic) that would erupt globally in the decade to come.
38308|0|Does its spoofing with a blunt instrument instead of a scalpel, and it's engineered to appeal to the lowest instincts of its targeted adolescent audiences.
13507|1|A must for every 10-year-old boy.
42156|0|Well, everybody knows November means just one thing to most folks: a big, fat turkey. And guess who's the stuffing?
68331|0|Even the weather seems tailored to the script's shifting needs.
44007|1|Audiences will leave with the sense of having been a privileged visitor.
44373|0|This may still sound intriguing, but it's badly executed.
2609|1|For those who would question Crichton's motives, Levinson and Attanasio haven't let men off the hook.
63814|1|With fewer sensational confrontations, The Embalmer is a major work. As it stands, it signals the emergence of an exceptional filmmaker.
14838|1|Adorable kid transforms womanizer in poignant Oscar winner.
56361|1|Live-action animal adventures have always been a Disney specialty, and this one has a pretty compelling plot.
102598|1|For all its flaws and fumbles there is a certain guilty pleasure in Choke.
79274|1|Depends a little too much on the viewer's tolerance for Eddie Bracken and Betty Hutton trying to out-mug and out-frenzy each other to be everyone's cup of tea.
23213|0|A much slicker, studio-friendly job than the first one was, with its much more famous cast, and its easier aesthetic.
25410|1|Fontaine laces her story with enough humor, suspense and insight to lift the plot far above the merely sleazy and titillating.
101773|1|Elevated by superb performances, led by Edward Norton and a very chilling Colin Farrell.
61858|0|By the end of the film we also expect some closure; satisfaction in knowing that the Gromberg family is going to be okay. This conclusion never comes and we are left wondering whether the family will indeed persevere.
40544|1|Shyamalan has a way to go before ascending to the level of Alfred Hitchcock, the uncontested master of psychological suspense, but he clearly wants to do so.
59663|1|Outstanding, understated Western; great performance by Farnsworth as an outlaw whose time has passed.
941|1|It remains reasonably faithful to the original short story, the production values are okay and some of the dialogue is pretty effective.
72709|1|Creepy and effective
21257|1|...an obvious step down from its stellar predecessor...
32646|0|If the slow moving pace of this movie (from the road to the ring) doesn't get to you, an annoying performance by Lolita Davidovich will.
68272|1|A typically interesting effort from the vastly underrated Walter Hill that's improved with age.
96287|1|Despite its almost painfully silly predictability, this film somehow manages to be engaging and rather enjoyable, thanks mainly to The Rock's on-screen charisma.
52304|1|A moving tale of love and destruction in unexpected places, unexamined lives.
9032|1|Welles's deeply haunting depiction of the life of William Randolph Hearst has long been synonymous with the director's spectacularly odd and genuinely tragic career.
55580|0|If we lived in a just universe, Captain Ron, a farce filmed in and around the Devil's Triangle, would simply have vanished into another dimension.
3330|1|Scary, convincing and thought-provoking.
89276|0|West seems to mistake smugness for genre savvy, and his aggressive, arm-punching brand of pandering quickly grows tiresome, and then unbearable.
58699|1|Daniel Day-Lewis' magnetic portrayal of a 19th-century ganglord who butchered his enemies as readily as he carved up a freshly killed hog.
56317|1|It's funnier than most of ths films Hollywood passes off as humor ten years later.
39874|0|This is a pointless B-film actioner, a remake of the gritty 1971 British noir classic directed by Mike Hodges.
31303|1|The film takes aim at so many contemporary targets and with such gusto that you fear each time you laugh you might be missing another wonderful line.
89636|1|The movie does not waste the performances, but the screenplay could have served them better.
92156|0|Provence looks like a lovely place to visit and Mr. Scott deserves his rest now and then, but let's hope he gets back to darker work soon.
22811|1|Streep's performance will probably secure her another Oscar nomination.
1826|0|Sub-par Spike Lee
67051|1|The narrative momentum may sputter, but the vivid performances keep the film from dragging.
15065|0|Children of Men is like an elongated episode of Doctor Who for adults, without the funny bits, David Tennant's oozy charm and the ironic sense of its own fundamental silliness.
5323|0|A jeering, dreamlike comedy with nothing much on its mind except how neat the Coen brothers are and how stupid or contemptible everybody else is, including everyone in the audience.
7951|1|Harriet the Spy is an intelligent, insightful look at the tribulations of being a creative, misunderstood misfit at age eleven.
62269|1|A solid followup to a truly genre-transcending film.
57882|0|A film with these specific strengths ought to be at least worth it for the [slasher] genre faithful, and it is - but it is solely for the faithful.
47886|0|The performances in several smaller roles are so mechanical that they lend Kill Me Later the tone of a vanity production.
98507|1|This festival favourite has moments of promise but Jellyfish is lacking, has an unwillingness to completely contextualize the women in this contemporary setting
